It’s part of Y Combinator Batch W25, and its mission is straightforward yet ambitious: to transform generic course materials into personalized exam preparation tools using cutting-edge artificial intelligence.\n\n### The Product\n\nAlice.tech offers a simple yet powerful solution. Students can upload their study materials and receive immediate, tailored support that covers three main pillars:\n\n1. **Better Understanding**: The platform provides clear overviews and explanations for key topics, supplemented by an AI chat that understands the student’s specific context.\n  \n2. **Effective Practicing**: Alice creates custom exercises based on the student's needs—think flashcards, multiple-choice questions, and full exam simulations crafted to suit individual learning styles and curricular requirements.\n\n3. **Targeted Improvement**: The platform identifies areas where the student struggles, helping them focus their efforts more efficiently and effectively.\n\nBut it’s more than just a study tool; Alice allows students to engage socially by studying with friends and competing in challenges, making learning not just productive but also enjoyable.\n\n### Traction and Growth\n\nAlice.tech has already attracted over 2,000 students, an impressive feat for a new company, and it boasts a monthly revenue growth rate (MRR) of 30% in its B2C segment, with emerging interest in B2B. \n\n### Team and Leadership\n\nWith a lean team of six, the company benefits from the mentorship of Tom Blomfield as their Group Partner, which lends a competitive edge to their strategy and growth.\n\n### Why Alice.tech Stands Out\n\nThe ability to support multiple languages (currently ten) sets Alice apart, catering to a diverse student population. The platform also prides itself on fostering a more engaging study experience that doesn’t just promise better grades but delivers active, interactive learning.\n\nIn terms of accessibility, Alice offers various pricing plans, including a free \"Hustler Plan\" that provides basic functionality alongside more comprehensive paid tiers.\n\n### User Experience and Reviews\n\nStudent testimonials are positive, highlighting the efficiency of the tool in simplifying study processes and enhancing exam readiness. From generating practice questions post-lecture to providing instant feedback on performance, users find Alice.tech to be an invaluable study companion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlice.tech is not just another education tool; it’s a responsive, intelligent platform designed to redefine the way students prepare for exams. With its growing user base and expanding features, it's a prime example of how AI can improve personal learning experiences. If you're a student looking to streamline your study process and boost your exam confidence, Alice might just be the AI study buddy you've been waiting for.\n\nFor more information, check out their website at [alice.tech](https://www.alice.tech/).",

It emerged from the realization that traditional SIS providers often fall short, only covering essential data like student tracking, grades, and attendance. In many cases, schools end up using a patchwork of tools to manage operations. Scout aims to replace this chaos with an AI-powered, fully integrated system that streamlines school and district administration.\n\n**Mission**  \nThe mission of Scout is clear: to help school districts operate as high-performing organizations. By automating the routine, such as attendance tracking and compliance reporting, Scout frees up educators to focus on delivering personalized education. They want to ensure that every student receives the instruction they deserve without the administrative burden weighing them down.\n\n**Key Features**  \nWhat sets Scout apart? Here are some highlights:\n\n1. **AI-Powered Automation**: Automates over 50% of teachers’ administrative tasks, significantly boosting productivity.\n2. **Comprehensive Tools**: Provides features like attendance tracking, regulatory compliance, and document management.\n3. **Integrations**: Compatible with over 50 online learning platforms, quickly adding new integrations to fit unique school needs.\n4. **Data Security**: Prioritizes safety with advanced encryption and real-time monitoring, complying with all relevant legal standards to protect student data.\n5. **Exceptional Support**: Offers world-class, responsive customer service, ensuring direct access to the executive team for any issues or questions.\n\n**The Vision**  \nScout builds its software with the understanding that independent study schools, particularly in California, face unique challenges related to paperwork and compliance. Their system tackles these issues head-on, allowing educators to redirect their energies toward teaching rather than drowning in bureaucracy.\n\n**The Team**  \nScout is a lean operation, currently staffed with a team of two, but backed by the expertise and resources of Y Combinator, where it’s part of Batch W25. Aaron Epstein serves as the Group Partner guiding their journey.\n\n**Engagement**  \nInterested in seeing Scout in action? They invite schools to book a demo through their website to explore how their SIS can transform school management.\n\n**Concluding Thoughts**  \nScout isn’t just another software provider; it’s a partner in the educational journey, helping schools not just survive but thrive in the digital age. As they put it, “Saved money, saved time, saved headaches.” That’s a promise every busy educator can appreciate.\n\nFor more information, check out their website: [Scout for Schools](https://scoutforschools.com/).",

With a compact team of 10, Literably's mission is to enhance early literacy assessment for elementary schools through innovative software that streamlines the testing process for K-8 students.\n\n**What They're Doing:**\n\nLiterably's platform allows teachers to assess reading skills efficiently using their mobile and web applications. Instead of spending countless hours on manual testing, educators can now administer assessments online, turning what used to be a lengthy process into a streamlined operation where results are available within 24 hours. This not only saves teachers precious instructional time but also helps them focus on teaching rather than testing.\n\nThe products offered by Literably range from the **Universal Literacy Screener**, which identifies students at risk for reading difficulties (including dyslexia), to assessments focusing on phonological awareness, phonics, oral reading fluency, vocabulary, comprehension, and more. Importantly, their tools can assess students in Spanish as well, broadening access to literacy support for diverse populations.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\nIn a significant milestone, Literably recently joined forces with Heggerty, aiming to provide seamless, science-based literacy assessment to thousands of schools across the U.S. This acquisition is set to amplify their impact in the early education landscape, allowing for greater integration of their assessments in instructional practices.\n\n**Why Literably Stands Out:**\n\n1. **Time-Saving for Educators:** Teachers can implement assessments either independently by students or directly alongside them, ensuring a shorter turnaround for results without compromising instructional time.\n   \n2. **Data-Driven Insights:** Literably provides intuitive reports that allow educators and administrators to customize interventions based on individual student needs, thereby creating targeted learning experiences to foster growth.\n\n3. **Rigorous Research Backing:** Their assessments were developed with R&D funding from the U.S. Department of Education, and are undergoing validation studies to continually improve their efficacy.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nLiterably embodies the future of literacy education through technology. By simplifying assessments and providing actionable insights, it helps educators make data-informed decisions that directly affect student outcomes. Whether you’re a teacher looking to minimize assessment time or an administrator aiming for comprehensive reporting, Literably is carving a notable path in the educational landscape.

Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.\r\n\n👨‍🏫 Who We Are\r\n\nThe three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. \r\n\nAfter we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.\r\n\nWe worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. \r\n\nWe then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. \r\n\n🚀 Present & Future\r\n\nCurrently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. \r\n\nSo far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. \r\n\nWe plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries.",

Their solution intelligently routes less complex requests to faster models while your current LLM handles the more intricate queries.\n\n#### Solutions for Developers\n\nDownlink enhances your AI infrastructure by:\n- **Boosting Performance**: Experience a performance increase of 20% or more without sacrificing accuracy, lowering response times, and expanding rate limits.\n- **Simplifying Architecture**: Their drop-in API means less technical debt and complexity, allowing developers to focus on shipping rather than maintenance.\n- **Getting Started Quickly**: Their service works seamlessly with various languages like Python, TypeScript, and Go, meaning you can plug it into your existing stack with ease. \n\nFor example, a simple use case in Python looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\nopenai.base_url = \"https://app.downlink.dev/api/v1\"\nopenai.api_key = \"__YOUR_DOWNLINK_API_KEY__\"\n\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Say 'Hello World'\"}]\n)\n\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content) # Output: \"Hello World\"\n```\n\n#### A Lean Team, Big Ambitions\n\nThough currently there’s just one employee, Downlink is built on a solid vision and aspirations. Led by their Group Partner, Nicolas Dessaigne, they’re poised to redefine how companies leverage AI in their applications. \n\nIf you're an AI engineer tired of wrestling with latency and complex architectures, Downlink offers a much-needed lifeline. Check them out at their website [downlink.dev](https://downlink.dev/) to see how they can optimize your AI models.\n\nWith Downlink, you’re not just keeping pace; you’re setting the pace.",

The stark reality they address is a troublingly high student-teacher ratio of 50:1 in public schools and exorbitant tuition fees in private institutions that can soar up to $7,500 per year per child.\n\nWhat makes Kidato stand out? They maintain an impressive student-teacher ratio of 5:1, ensuring that each child receives personalized attention and support. Their educational model is built around delivering a rigorous international curriculum that parallels that of established private schools but comes at a fraction of the cost. This approach is designed to make quality education accessible, even in regions where affordability is a significant barrier.\n\nSince launching their learning-from-home program, Kidato has seen encouraging momentum, enrolling over 30 students in their second semester alone. The future looks bright, as they anticipate tripling that number by their upcoming semester.\n\nAs part of the Y Combinator Batch W21, Kidato is positioned within an influential network of innovators. Their team of 15 dedicated employees is set on making significant strides in the ed-tech space, leveraging technology to bridge educational gaps.\n\nWith a focus on education and eLearning, Kidato is not just a startup; it’s a pivotal player in redefining how children in Africa can access quality education.

With a nimble team of three, the company's mission is to transform how knowledge is infused into language models, achieving this with an elegant approach that requires just 10 samples. \n\nWhat sets Automorphic apart? They’ve developed a technique that goes beyond the conventional context window limitations of large language models (LLMs). Their flagship product, **Conduit**, allows developers to fine-tune models seamlessly, providing the ability to train specific adapters for different behaviors or knowledge. This not only enhances model capabilities but does so efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\nAutomorphic’s approach to knowledge infusion addresses the inefficiencies of traditional methods, like prompt stuffing—techniques that can only take you so far. Instead, Conduit empowers teams to rapidly iterate on their models with human-in-the-loop feedback, drastically cutting down on the time to deploy improvements. The models learn and adapt over time, continuously enhancing performance based on real user inputs.\n\nMoreover, Conduit offers compatibility with the OpenAI API, allowing users to integrate the technology without having to overhaul their existing setups. For those concerned with data privacy, Automorphic also supports on-premises deployments, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure within clients' private cloud environments.\n\nIn a landscape where the demand for intelligent and adaptable language models is ever-increasing, Automorphic is positioned as a frontrunner—simplifying the way knowledge is integrated into AI and promising to empower developers in creating robust, self-improving models that evolve with their needs.\n\nTo keep up with Automorphic's developments or to join their private beta, check out their website at [automorphic.ai](https://automorphic.ai/) and dive into this exciting new frontier.",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.",

Founded in 2023 and currently part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Storia AI is on a mission to transform how developers interact with code. Their vision is straightforward yet ambitious: to build an open-source AI copilot that comprehensively understands a company's code and its broader context. \n\nAs the industry moves towards automating code generation, software engineers increasingly find themselves in roles that require deep comprehension of existing code rather than just writing new lines. Storia AI tackles this shift head-on with a tool named Sage. Think of Sage as a smart assistant for developers—an AI that not only generates suggestions but truly understands the nuances of a specific codebase.\n\n### What Can Sage Do?\n\nSage acts as a powerful resource for developers, capable of answering complex questions that go beyond simple coding tasks. Here’s what it offers:\n\n1. **Contextual Recommendations**: Developers can consult Sage on technical choices, like determining the right vector database that meets project constraints.\n2. **Comparative Analysis**: It can clarify why one database option might be more suitable than another—say, Redis versus Milvus.\n3. **Integration Queries**: Sage assesses codebases for compatibility with other libraries and provides actionable steps for integration.\n\nWhat sets Sage apart is its reliance on verified sources. Instead of generating potentially misleading information (a common issue known as \"hallucination\"), Sage provides answers anchored in a wealth of documentation from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and internal technical documents. This places reliable, contextualized knowledge directly in the hands of developers.\n\n### A Strong Foundation\n\nStoria AI was founded by a small but formidable team with deep roots in both AI and software engineering. Julia has extensive experience with contextual neural networks, having worked on foundational technologies at Google, while Mihail was instrumental in developing early LLMs (Large Language Models) at Amazon Alexa. Their 20+ years of combined experience positions them uniquely to tackle the challenges of building an AI that comprehends complex codebases.\n\n### Where They’re Headed\n\nCurrently located in Millbrae, CA, Storia AI operates with a compact team of two talented individuals, backed by David Lieb as their Group Partner. The tagging of their work in areas like ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘developer tools’, and ‘machine learning’ indicates a focused strategy that resonates deeply within the tech community.

They leverage technology that not only challenges candidates but also provides feedback and insights grounded in over 200 fine-tuned metrics. This empowers businesses to make informed hiring decisions efficiently.\n\nThe potential formats are:\n- **Case Study Interviews**: For assessing problem-solving and communication skills.\n- **Technical Interviews**: To evaluate quantitative reasoning.\n- **Role-Play Interviews**: Focusing on client interaction and problem-solving abilities.\n- **Expert Interviews**: Drawing from specialized knowledge.\n\n**Equipped for the Future**  \nMindely is not just about replacing human interaction; it enhances it by ensuring that the hiring managers can spend their time where it matters most—building relationships with the best candidates. This is particularly crucial in the fast-paced hiring environments that characterize modern workforce needs.\n\n**Team and Vision**  \nWith a lean team of four and backed by notable figures in the startup ecosystem like Nicolas Dessaigne as a group partner, Mindely is positioning itself as the go-to solution for companies that aim to modernize their hiring processes with generative AI technology.\n\n**Connect and Engage**  \nExplore Mindely’s offerings or book a demo through their [website](http://www.mindely.ai).

With the mission of being a modern-day Scholastic, Litnerd has grown impressively—by 14x over the last school year. Yet what distinguishes them is not just their growth; it's their approach that combines literacy with creativity, technology, and fun.\n\n**Unique Approach to Learning:**\nLitnerd creates original intellectual property (IP) alongside its community and partner brands. From this collaboration, they develop books, media, and learning curriculums, all enhanced by an AI-driven personalized tutor designed to make reading and writing not just educational but engaging.\n\n**How It Works:**\nThe Litnerd app is a gamified, social platform where kids actively participate in the reading process. The app incorporates live weekly community meetups and monthly e-tournaments, turning learning into a dynamic experience. Kids aren't just passive consumers; they become \"Kid Authors,\" co-creating and publishing their books with the help of Litnerd’s AI.\n\n**Proven Impact:**\nThe results have been significant—students using Litnerd showed a fourfold increase in the pass rate on annual state Reading (ELA) exams. On average, kids engage with the app for 10-20 minutes outside of classroom time, underscoring its stickiness. The curriculum is firmly grounded in the Science of Reading, aligned with Common Core Standards, and aims to advance key skills like comprehension, vocabulary, phonics, and fluency.\n\n**Community and Connectivity:**\nLitnerd actively connects with schools and families, offering programs like the Young Authors Program that includes live assemblies, guided writing sessions, and real publishing opportunities for students. Over 14,000 students have already benefited from Litnerd in their classrooms, and the feedback is overwhelmingly positive—92% of kids reported that Litnerd made reading fun.\n\n**A Bright Future:**\nWith a compact team of six, Litnerd is not just building an app; it's cultivating a community of young readers and writers. The blend of education and entertainment, backed by a solid foundation of research-based practices, showcases Litnerd's commitment to transforming literacy education. \n\nIf you're interested in leveling up your child's reading experience, check out their offerings at [Litnerd.com](https://litnerd.com).\n\n**Contact Information:**\n- **Phone**: (929) 203 - 4608\n- **Email**: contact@litnerd.com\n\nWhether you're a parent looking to enrich your child's education or an educator seeking innovative tools for your classroom, Litnerd is paving the way for the future of learning.",

In Classkick, every student's’ handwriting, whether it’s a 2nd grader drawing a picture or an 11th grader doing physics, appears live to the teacher in a mosaic of working students. The teacher can zoom into any student’s sheet to help them and ask a probing question to redirect their thinking. By the time the student has read and thought through the feedback, the teacher has already swept off and helped 5 others.\r\n\nWe are hyper focused on one goal: increase student learning.

At its core, Circlemind leverages the power of Knowledge Graphs and PageRank to enable efficient, context-aware, and interpretable AI reasoning and retrieval.\n\n### Mission and Vision\n\nCirclemind's mission is simple yet profound: to develop a next-generation memory system for AI that goes beyond the limitations of current RAG methodologies. By adopting a unique approach that combines vector databases with knowledge graphs, Circlemind can create intelligent systems that adapt to user-specific contexts, data, and queries.\n\n### What Makes Circlemind Unique?\n\nThe cornerstone of Circlemind's technology is what's known as **GraphRAG**, a highly adaptable retrieval framework. Unlike traditional static RAG approaches, Circlemind's system continuously learns and evolves based on new data and interactions. This self-improving capability allows it to provide more nuanced and relevant responses to complex queries. Here are some of the standout features:\n\n- **Promptable GraphRAG**: Users can command the AI's graph construction in plain English, ensuring the technology aligns closely with the user's intent and data specifics.\n- **Multi-Hop Retrieval**: The system can reason across a network of memories, retrieving highly relevant information seamlessly.\n- **Whole Dataset Reasoning**: Capable of handling complex queries that require an aggregate understanding of data, unlike naïve RAG systems that may struggle with holistic insights.\n- **Dynamic Data Adaptation**: GraphRAG excels with evolving information, making it ideal for applications that require updated context retrieval.\n\n### Pricing and Accessibility\n\nCirclemind aims to democratize access to advanced AI tools. They offer a **Community Edition** that is free for self-hosting, making it accessible for hobbyists and small projects. For businesses needing advanced features and support, there’s a subscription model priced at **$300 per month**. Custom enterprise solutions are also available, catering to scalable team needs.\n\n### The Team\n\nWith a compact team of three, Circlemind's efforts are supported by a robust partnership with industry expert **Diana Hu**, who brings valuable insights from her experience in cutting-edge technology development. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nCirclemind is positioned to push the boundaries of AI technology by harnessing the strengths of most modern systems while addressing their deficiencies. Their innovative approach could redefine how AI interacts with the vast amounts of information available today, allowing for more sophisticated and intuitive applications. For a closer look or to experiment with their offerings, check out their website at [Circlemind](https://circlemind.co) and don’t hesitate to **book a demo** or start with **100 free credits** to explore their capabilities firsthand. \n\nIn a world that craves smarter AI solutions, Circlemind's advancements could very well chart a new path forward.",

Based in San Francisco, this small but mighty team of six is on a mission: to create human-like voice AI agents that can learn and improve over time. \n\n### What They Do\n\nAt its core, Leaping AI provides a platform for businesses to develop and deploy voice AI agents that handle complex customer interactions—from sales to customer support. They started by focusing on automating contact centers, where they've successfully replaced or streamlined the functions of over 100 human agents. The result? Their AI agents now manage an impressive 70% of incoming calls while maintaining a stellar 90% customer satisfaction rate. \n\nTo illustrate their effectiveness, one of their clients saw a 30% conversion rate within just a week of launching an outbound campaign using Leaping AI agents. For context, a similar campaign with human agents would typically take five weeks to achieve the same results. That’s not just efficiency; that’s a game changer.\n\n### Features and Benefits\n\nLeaping AI distinguishes itself with several remarkable capabilities:\n- **Human-like Conversations:** Utilizing cutting-edge generative AI technology, their voice agents deliver conversational experiences that feel natural and engaging.\n- **Multi-channel Support:** Beyond just voice, their system can integrate email and chatbot interactions, streamlining customer communication across platforms.\n- **Intuitive Tools for Businesses:** With a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface, building AI conversations doesn’t require a coding background. This makes the deployment process accessible for companies of all sizes.\n- **Cost Efficiency:** Leveraging AI can lead to a significant reduction—up to 70%—in operational costs compared to human-operated systems.\n\n### Looking Ahead\n\nAs they continue to innovate in areas like outbound campaigns and quality monitoring, Leaping AI is poised to serve not just retail but also sectors like telecommunications and business process outsourcing (BPO). Their commitment to compliance with regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, ensures that they prioritize user data protection, making them appealing to enterprises concerned about privacy.\n\nIn summary, Leaping AI isn't just another tech startup; they're redefining how companies interact with their customers by enabling them to leap into a future powered by efficient, self-improving AI.
