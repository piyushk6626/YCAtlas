Founded in 2024 and part of the Y Combinator Batch W25, this two-person team is setting out to tackle a pervasive issue in the world of AI.\n\nIn an age where AI products like Q&A bots and virtual assistants rely heavily on retrieval systems, the limitations of current methods are glaring. Most existing systems employ basic semantic or hybrid search techniques that often miss the mark, leading to inaccuracies and frustrating hallucinations generated by large language models (LLMs). This isn't just a minor inconvenience; it can derail entire projects and erode trust in AI capabilities.\n\nZeroEntropy aims to change all that. By infusing its search API with enhanced intelligence, the company is empowering developers to build AI applications that are not only more reliable but also significantly more accurate. This dual focus on precision and user experience sets ZeroEntropy apart in a crowded field of Developer Tools.\n\nWith Harj Taggar as their Group Partner, the startup is poised to make waves in the realms of search, AI, and developer tools. If you’re interested in learning more or diving into the details of their offerings, check out their website at [zeroentropy.dev](https://www.zeroentropy.dev).\n\nIn summary, ZeroEntropy is tackling a core problem in AI—search accuracy over unstructured data—with a fresh perspective that aims to elevate the capabilities of AI products everywhere. Watch this space; they may just be the solution the industry has been waiting for.",

Their mission is straightforward yet impactful: to optimize demand forecasting for retailers, enabling them to buy, allocate, and plan their products more efficiently.\n\n**How It Works:**\nMetreecs employs AI-driven demand forecasting to tackle two critical retail challenges—overstock and out-of-stock situations. By providing actionable insights, the platform helps retailers streamline inventory decisions, reducing waste, freeing up capital, and ultimately enhancing sales performance. This means customers can restock before products sell out while minimizing excess inventory. As a result, they can expect an impressive increase in sell-through rates by up to 20%, capture more sales opportunities leading to a 35% growth in revenue, and achieve remarkable ROI, sometimes up to 10x.\n\n**Current Operations:**\nDespite being a small team with just three employees, Metreecs has positioned itself as a vital partner for retailers looking to revolutionize their inventory strategies. The company is based in Tigery, France, with Nicolas Dessaigne as the Group Partner steering their strategic vision. \n\nTheir platform offers a robust suite of features designed to optimize product management, such as:\n- **Rebalance**: Automated suggestions to allocate inventory effectively.\n- **Reorder**: Predicting top-performing products to prevent stock outages.\n- **Buy**: Facilitating purchasing decisions based on data-driven insights.\n- **Analyze**: Tracking product performance across various sales channels.\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nWith the retail landscape becoming increasingly competitive, Metreecs champions the idea that intelligent inventory decisions can differentiate successful retailers from those struggling to keep up. Their approach not only mitigates risks associated with stock management but also empowers retailers to respond dynamically to market changes.\n\nFor more information, to get a demo, or calculate your potential impact, check out their website at [Metreecs](https://www.metreecs.com).",

It's an innovative AI-powered personal shopper focused on home decor, allowing customers to avoid the time-consuming task of rifling through countless online retailers. With a small but competent team of three, Rastro is already generating around $25,000 in monthly gross merchandise volume (GMV) with an impressive 15% profit margin.\n\nThe company was birthed from the minds of former Shopify AI engineers, who envisioned a platform that could aggregate products from across the internet based on individual tastes. Rastro aims for nothing less than to become the \"Perplexity for shopping\"—a reference to how they enhance the searching process through intelligent and personalized recommendations.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nHere's how Rastro operates in four streamlined steps:\n\n1. **Connect with the Design Team:** Customers start by booking a quick 10-minute call with Rastro's design experts. This is where they discuss their vision and preferences while sharing images of their space.\n   \n2. **Product Sourcing:** Rastro’s AI agents then comb through over 40 different retailer sites to find unique home decor items that match the customer's style and budget.\n\n3. **Product Selection:** Once the AI has curated a list of matching products, they’re sent directly to the customer's inbox for review. Customers can choose what appeals to them from this curated selection.\n\n4. **Delivery:** Products are shipped directly to the customer's door without additional costs. Rastro earns money through referrals and partnerships, making it a free service for users.\n\n**Market Potential**\n\nGiven that hiring an interior designer can cost thousands, Rastro presents a much more affordable option for consumers wanting stylish home decor. Their AI-driven approach has shown to convert at rates ten times higher than traditional e-commerce searches, making for a compelling case for both individual users and potential investors.\n\nCurrently part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, Rastro is tagged under consumer tech, retail-tech, and AI, indicating its growth potential in the expansive market of home goods.\n\nThe company is backed by significant expertise in AI and e-commerce, with figures like Tom Blomfield as a Group Partner. With its blend of innovative technology and user-centric design, Rastro is positioned to not just provide products, but to curate an experience. \n\nTo learn more about their offerings or to start your personalized shopping journey, you can visit their [website](https://rastro.sh).",

Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.\r\n\nWe integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n\nTop merchants using Yuma can automate up to 60% of their support tickets fully autonomously.\r\n\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\nThere are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\nYuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.\r\n\nThese agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.\r\n\nWe believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.\r\n\nCurrently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.\r\n\nWe are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.\r\n\n## Fun Fact\r\n\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",

It offers an orchestration platform that deploys autonomous AI agents focused on enhancing customer service experiences for e-commerce businesses, primarily large Shopify merchants. By integrating seamlessly with help desk software such as Zendesk, Kustomer, and Gorgias, Yuma can handle a significant volume of daily support queries—up to 60% can be managed autonomously, drastically cutting down response times and operational costs.\n\n---\n\n### Challenges for Shopify Merchants\n\nMany Shopify merchants, particularly those generating over $10 million annually, excel at selling but dread customer support—a task that often leads to high costs and frustrating experiences. With countless support requests flooding in daily, many merchants are stuck with high agent turnover and unsatisfactory service quality. They’ve been promised automated solutions in the past, which often fell short of expectations, resulting in poor customer interactions.\n\n---\n\n### How Yuma AI is Different\n\nYuma sets itself apart by not being just another generic AI chatbot.
