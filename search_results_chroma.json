Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.",

            "generated_description": "**Storia AI: Revolutionizing Code Understanding with an Open-Source AI Copilot**\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, Storia AI is carving out a unique niche. Founded in 2023 and currently part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Storia AI is on a mission to transform how developers interact with code. Their vision is straightforward yet ambitious: to build an open-source AI copilot that comprehensively understands a company's code and its broader context. \n\nAs the industry moves towards automating code generation, software engineers increasingly find themselves in roles that require deep comprehension of existing code rather than just writing new lines. Storia AI tackles this shift head-on with a tool named Sage. Think of Sage as a smart assistant for developers—an AI that not only generates suggestions but truly understands the nuances of a specific codebase.\n\n### What Can Sage Do?\n\nSage acts as a powerful resource for developers, capable of answering complex questions that go beyond simple coding tasks. Here’s what it offers:\n\n1. **Contextual Recommendations**: Developers can consult Sage on technical choices, like determining the right vector database that meets project constraints.\n2. **Comparative Analysis**: It can clarify why one database option might be more suitable than another—say, Redis versus Milvus.\n3. **Integration Queries**: Sage assesses codebases for compatibility with other libraries and provides actionable steps for integration.\n\nWhat sets Sage apart is its reliance on verified sources. Instead of generating potentially misleading information (a common issue known as \"hallucination\"), Sage provides answers anchored in a wealth of documentation from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and internal technical documents. This places reliable, contextualized knowledge directly in the hands of developers.\n\n### A Strong Foundation\n\nStoria AI was founded by a small but formidable team with deep roots in both AI and software engineering. Julia has extensive experience with contextual neural networks, having worked on foundational technologies at Google, while Mihail was instrumental in developing early LLMs (Large Language Models) at Amazon Alexa. Their 20+ years of combined experience positions them uniquely to tackle the challenges of building an AI that comprehends complex codebases.\n\n### Where They’re Headed\n\nCurrently located in Millbrae, CA, Storia AI operates with a compact team of two talented individuals, backed by David Lieb as their Group Partner. The tagging of their work in areas like ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘developer tools’, and ‘machine learning’ indicates a focused strategy that resonates deeply within the tech community. As they progress, there are ambitious goals to deepen Sage’s understanding of not just private codebases but potentially every line of code available online.\n\nIn a nutshell, Storia AI is not just another tech startup; it's a thoughtful response to the inevitable evolution of software development. By building a bridge between AI and developers, they’re paving the way for more efficient, informed, and high-quality code architecture. If you’re interested in learning more or seeking support for your own codebase, check out their website at [storia.ai](https://storia.ai). \n\nStoria AI is a company to watch, not just for what they are building today but for how they will shape the future of coding.",

            "generated_description": "**Dataleap: The Future of Market Research for Consultants**\n\nFounded in 2023 and based in San Francisco, Dataleap is a fresh face in the market research landscape, specifically tailored for management consulting firms and corporate strategy divisions. Often described as \"Perplexity for Consultants,\" Dataleap leverages generative AI to streamline the research workflow, providing a user experience reminiscent of ChatGPT while ensuring access to data from reputable sources.\n\n### What Makes Dataleap Stand Out?\n\n1. **Natural Language Interface**: Dataleap uniquely blends the conversational abilities of ChatGPT with a vast repository of reliable market data. This means users can not only ask questions in plain language but also receive answers linked directly to the credible sources they come from.\n\n2. **Workflow Optimization**: Dataleap simplifies the research process, whether it's locating the right insights, managing a team’s internal knowledge base, or sharing findings seamlessly. Collaboration is baked into the platform, making it easier for teams to bolster their strategic decisions with sound data.\n\n3. **Enterprise-Grade Security**: With robust data encryption (AES-256) and strict access controls, Dataleap ensures that sensitive information is well protected. As they work towards SOC 2 Type 2 compliance, they’re committed to the highest standards of data security.\n\n4. **Trusted Collaborators**: The company has already formed partnerships with industry giants like BCG, Siemens Energy, and Uniper, standing testament to its reliability and effectiveness in the field.\n\n5. **Small Team, Big Impact**: Currently with just two employees, including Group Partner Harj Taggar from Y Combinator (part of Batch S24), Dataleap embodies the lean startup ethos. They’re focusing on making their AI assistant an indispensable tool for consultants everywhere.\n\n### What’s Next for Dataleap?\n\nWith aspirations to continue building on its solid foundation, Dataleap is looking at expanding its integrations and features to meet the high-paced demands of the consulting world. They are currently working on seamless SharePoint integrations and expanding their data extraction capabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDataleap is shaking up how consultants conduct market research by marrying AI with practical, verifiable data access. As more professionals recognize the value of high-quality, actionable insights—faster and more efficiently—Dataleap is on track to become a vital player in the generative AI space for enterprise research.\n\nFor more exploration, check out their website at [Dataleap.ai](https://dataleap.ai/) and book a demo to see their AI research assistant in action.",
