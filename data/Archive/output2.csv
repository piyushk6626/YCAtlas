**TL;DR**
Commercial insurance brokers spend 80% of their time on manual, repetitive tasks like policy analysis, manual data entry, documentation, billing and administration. Vantel builds AI software that automates these workflows, **currently helping brokers save 10+ hours per week**. Our first product lets brokers compare five 100-page insurance policies across 50 factors in 5 minutes instead of 5 hours.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ybGwHNyi90>
**The Problem: Commercial Insurance is Extremely Manual**
Almost every company needs insurance. Most companies do not have the competency in-house to know exactly what coverage they need. Because of this, they often hire a commercial insurance broker to advise them on insurance-related matters.
After interviewing 100 commercial insurance professionals, we discovered some of the largest challenges in the industry: documents and workflows are unstandardized, there are multiple parties involved, and high-quality data is hard to collect. This results in **commercial insurance brokers spending the majority of their time on highly manual processes** :
  * Comparing policy documents
  * Validating insurance requirements in contracts versus policies
  * Regulatory documentation of advisory work
  * Compiling claims data from multiple sources into a common format
  * Translating complex material from carriers to a digestible format for the client


**Our Solution: AI-Powered Workflow Automation for Brokers**
Vantel is building an AI platform that automates the most time-consuming tasks for commercial insurance brokers. We have started with:
**1. Policy Comparison**
  * Compare 5 policies in 5 minutes (versus 5 hours if done manually)
  * Works with any carrier and policy type, instantly recognizing differences and key terms
  * Ranks policies based on coverage quality


**2. Contract Validation**
  * Cross-check insurance requirements in contracts versus policies
  * Identifies gaps in current coverage, to avoid hidden risks
  * Enables more extensive client service – this is currently a high-touch activity


**Why Now?**
With recent advances in LLMs, we are creating a product that was impossible to build 12 months ago. During our conversations with brokers, we have learned that **it is absolutely possible to build a revolutionary product in commercial insurance in just a few months**. The feedback we’re getting from brokers is giving us an incredible conviction that we’re on the right track. It is amazing to see their jaws drop when they realize countless hours of work can be automated with our software, freeing up time to serve more clients.

**Intro**
[Nitrode](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/nitrode.com/>) is an AI-assisted gaming platform designed to transform your gaming development experience. If you’ve ever wanted to build a game, Nitrode empowers you to effortlessly build, launch, and play your favorite games. Leveraging AI, Nitrode streamlines the game creation and launching process, allowing creators to focus on their vision without getting bogged down by mechanics or technical complexities.
**The Problem**
The complexity of current game engines presents a significant barrier for aspiring developers, often discouraging them from pursuing the creation of high-quality games despite their passion and creativity. These engines typically require a deep understanding of programming, sophisticated designs, and the ability to navigate complex interfaces, making the development process overwhelming. This high level of difficulty forces game development to be a niche area for developers - preventing many developers from creating games they enjoy.
**The Solution: Nitrode!**
With Nitrode, playing and creating games go hand in hand. Our platform offers a seamless and intuitive space for gamers to discover and play, while our dedicated creation engine (built off of Godot) provides powerful tools to simplify game development and launch. With features such as world generation, code-assist, and a new interface, every developer is now a game developer.

# Archon: Fast-track selling software to government
Get the cybersecurity requirements you need to sell software to government.

We’re George and Sam—co-founders of Archon, and former government staffers.
**TL;DR:** Our free-to-integrate SDK gives you all the cybersecurity requirements you need to sell to government faster and cheaper. This saves companies $1M (2/3rds of the cost) and reduces the timeline from 16 to 6 months.
**Problem: The government software market is locked behind an opaque, million-dollar compliance process (called FedRAMP) that favors big incumbents with lots of time.**
**Solution:** Our SDK provides compliant-out-of-the-box implementations of all the compliance features you need to sell to government – authentication, logging, access control, etc. You can integrate it into your existing codebase in a week, and we handle all of the obscure compliance restrictions so you don’t have to.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87386&key=user_uploads/2110890/2caad249-0936-4910-9a4e-12ad4425e4f5)
If you want to sell your software to government agencies, start exploring our SDK [here.](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/archon.inc/docs>)
**We condense the FedRAMP process into 4 steps.**
  1. Integrate our free SDK (what we’re launching today)
  2. Self-serve onboarding; then we prepare your 700-page security package
  3. Get an audit
  4. Wait for the Federal authorization board to approve your audit


A typical Series A startup spends $1.5M on consultants and 1.5 years on the first 2 steps. Archon’s SDK cuts the integration timeline down to 1 week. We also know many startups that never sold their software to the government because the barrier was just too high. **Yet, the government’s IT spending accounts for 20% of the entire U.S. software market.** It’s our mission to eliminate these compliance hurdles and bring much-needed innovation from small tech to the federal sector.

**Context:**
We came to YC planning to build AI agents that would speed up government workflows. But, we realized that we’d be spending more of our time on government compliance, than on our actual product. Currently, companies seeking FedRAMP certification face two bad options: spend millions of dollars on consultants, or use loophole solutions that lock them into unfavorable terms. We're building the solution we wish existed - a straightforward path that helps software companies build lasting government partnerships.
**Team:**
  * **George Parks:** Advised diplomats on emerging technologies at State.
  * **Sam Jung:** Previously at State, advised the U.S. AI Safety Institute.


# **OUR ASK:**
  * **Anyone looking to sell software to the government, or get FedRAMP** , we’d be grateful for an introduction. Email us at founders@archon.inc
  * **If you want to sell to government, what technology do you use?** Our SDK is only available for NodeJS to start. Let us know what tech stack you use with [this form.](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/forms.office.com/r/m5vPfmqVP3>)

Hey everyone, we’re [Seth](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/x.com/sethsetse>) and [Ayo](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/x.com/TheDonAyo>) and – co-founders of [a0.dev](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/a0.dev>)
**tl;dr**
[a0.dev](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/a0.dev>) is the fastest way to build React Native apps.
We generate the **entire front end** of your app for you—navigation, state management, and UI screens, all set up and ready to go.
Need to prototype a single screen instead? We also built a Component Generator, like **v0 but for React Native** , so you can quickly create and export screens with clean, production-ready code. Check out a quick demo video👇.
<https://youtu.be/GXVqQHJCCac>
# **The Problem:** _Building Apps is Hard_
Launching a mobile app is much harder than releasing a website. Setting up your project, coding every screen, managing state, and integrating the backend can take **weeks**.
And if you’re building for iOS, you need a Mac to run Xcode, deal with provisioning profiles, and compile your app—just to test it.
[**a0.dev**](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/a0.dev>) removes these barriers. We generate your app’s front end in minutes and let you preview it right away—no Mac, no complicated setup, no waiting.
# **Our Solutions:**
**#1 Full App Generator –** Build a complete React Native app
[a0.dev](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/a0.dev>) takes care of the entire front end of your mobile app—so you can go from idea to working UI in minutes.
✅ **Instant App Generation** – Describe your app, and we generate a complete React Native project with navigation, state management, and essential UI screens.
✅ **Live Preview & Hosting** – Share your app instantly with anyone, no need for TestFlight or manual builds. We host your app so you can test and iterate faster.
✅ **Remote Development Environment** – Work on your app from anywhere via an SSH-powered cloud IDE, with real-time reload and collaboration.
🚀 **Faster to Market** – We’re proving that high-quality mobile apps can be built in record time. We both shipped fully functional apps to the App Store in **under 24 hours** using [a0.dev](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/a0.dev>).
**Check out our demo** where we made a chess timer app in <10 minutes.
[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_upRVS63Fk**](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_upRVS63Fk>)
**#2 Component Generator –** Like **v0, but for React Native**
Already have an app or need to quickly prototype a single screen? Our Component Generator lets you create custom React Native UI screens in seconds.
While our focus is on building entire apps, our component generator helps you iterate and test ideas **faster than ever.** Try it out [here](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/a0.dev>).

**Our Story & Vision**
We started as indie app developers, making side income with apps generating up to $14k MRR. But we realized how hard it was for others to do the same. Our goal is to make mobile app development even easier than building websites. We want more people to be able to make a living creating and selling their own software. [a0.dev](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/a0.dev>) is the platform we wish we had when we started—and now we’re building it for you.
**Our Ask**
  * If you’re a mobile app developer who wants to make a new app or an aspiring app developer looking to enter the scene, contact us and try a0, we’ll help you create and launch your app in < 3 days.

**TLDR;** Mecha Health helps radiologists save time and effort by producing draft reports of medical images using AI. **The Problem: Too Many Scans Not Enough Doctors.** Due to a shortage of experts, US radiologists have to read 100 - 250+ studies per day, and this means that 55% have reported high levels of burnout. Additionally, patients sometimes have to wait days to receive medical reports for their scans due to backlogs. At times, this can result in preventable patient harm. **Our Solution: Accurate & Interpretable Medical Image Analysis.** We improve the reporting process by producing draft reports with AI and have invented new science to do this both accurately and safely. Our system can trace every finding to its visual source in the image and evidence each finding with examples from the training dataset. This allows for transparent reporting that doctors can trust.

**Our Background: Frontier Scientific Expertise.** We are leading researchers in machine learning and medical imaging having published in tier-one AI venues (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML). [Nina](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/nina-monta%C3%B1a-brown-6aa24b133/>), [Ahmed](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-abdulaal-5b8b6a295/>) & [Deji](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/ayodeji-ijishakin-b6208b1a9/>) crossed paths through University College London’s Medical Imaging PhD program. [Hugo](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-fry-825828271/>) met the team after he published AI research that was cited by Anthropic. Ahmed, a trained medical doctor from Imperial College London, witnessed firsthand how reporting delays harm patient outcomes—driving Mecha Health’s mission to transform radiology.

# Pig 🐷 - Automate Windows apps with AI
Pig is an API for automating workflows in Windows applications.

# TL;DR
[Pig](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/pig.dev>) is an API for launching and interacting with Windows virtual desktops.
Teams building automations can plug Pig into their AI agents, giving them the ability to operate computers as humans would, and perform high-value automations that were previously not possible.
[Sign up here](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/pig.dev/alpha>)
# The Problem
Many enterprise tools, from electronic health records to manufacturing supply-chain apps, are desktop-based and do not have a public API, preventing automation.
Traditional hardcoded RPA automations can be brittle. Subtle changes in the desktop apps, like popups or slow loading, can derail an automation. And complex workflows which require planning and judgment are not possible.
As a result, human office workers are employed to do highly repetitive tasks, often involving transferring text between different desktop apps, spreadsheets, and emails.
# Our Solution
[**https://youtu.be/xGli0TG7s3Y**](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/youtu.be/xGli0TG7s3Y>)
In this example, we show what’s possible building on Pig. We start a virtual desktop on Pig, and hand the connection to an agent loop running the [Claude Computer-Use](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use>) model.
The model then has a high-level task, and it begins to work, using Pig’s human-mimicking APIs such as:
  * Screenshotting the desktop screen
  * Clicking at coordinates
  * Entering keystrokes


All of which are enough to complete the task.
The Pig SDK gives you tools to manage VMs and send interactions to the desktop.

And importantly, Pig includes tools for agents to pass control to human operators during critical operations, such as clicking send on important emails, inputting payment information, or solving captchas.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87161&key=user_uploads/265552/d4cec1ed-390a-4ba1-8c48-b5d5173e9668)
We intend to be the personal computers for AI, and the embeddable observability window for your end users.
# Use Cases
Killer use-cases of Pig involve the following factors:
  * the workflow requires a Windows desktop app
  * The app does not have a public API


I expect to be surprised by what people build on Pig, but I’m most optimistic for use of:
  * Office Suite
  * Electronic Health Record Software
  * Claims Processing Software
  * Factory Control Systems
  * Lab Software


# Team & Background
I’m Erik, a second-time founder, with five years spent building cloud infrastructure.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87161&key=user_uploads/89898/6b51d5af-79d8-4d30-ad7e-f3e221dd3b53)
Most notably, I built [Banana](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/banana.dev>), a serverless GPU product used by more than three thousand teams to host production inference jobs.
Prior to Banana, I built a cloud desktop product for accelerating 3D design apps. Following Banana, I had the privilege to work with our former competitor, [Modal](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/modal.com>), on their serverless Python cloud.
Why am I building Pig?
Throughout 2024, I spent my time experimenting with new technologies and building up a thesis for what the future of AI tooling would be. After poking around a few wild ideas (such as data centers in space and internet-over-laser), I boomeranged back to the area that I know and love: compute infrastructure.
An AI founder friend called me up in Nov 2024, pitched me on this idea as something he needed to see in the world, and said, “Erik, you’re the single best founder to build this.”
And I agree. I am.
# How to become a user
Pig just launched our Alpha program, in which I work directly with early users to get their automations live on Pig.
Sign up at [**pig.dev/alpha**](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/pig.dev/alpha>) and I’ll reach out when Pig is ready for you!
And if you don’t need Pig, please tell at least one friend about it.
Oink! Erik

Hey everyone, we're Gregor and Magnus we are excited to launch Browser Use Cloud!
# What is Browser Use (Cloud)?
We started this project 3 months ago because it simply wasn’t possible to use the Browser with any LLM. We thought “How hard could it be to build the interface between LLMs and the web?” Fast forwarding 3 months, we have combined 25k ⭐ on Github and our Open Source community is growing fast.
Four days ago, OpenAI launched Operator. Since then, our community has been asking non-stop for a hosted version of browser-use. So we shipped that. Now you can use Browser Use as a B2C chat tool at <https://cloud.browser-use.com/>. We are releasing the API in the next few days. If you need API access for web agents, call us, don’t wait for the Open AI Operator API to be released!

# Existing problems
During many conversations with our discord community of 5000 people, we identified these core challenges in browser automation:
  * Websites change, and this breaks automation scripts. You usually only notice this, when it's too late.
  * Websites often catch bots. To avoid this, you need to use different IP addresses, solve captchas, and act more like a human.
  * Many people get frustrated with rate limits, parsing errors and API key management, when they do LLM-based scraping.
  * The most useful tasks often require you to log in. This can be a pain, especially if you have to type in your username and password every time.


[Browser Use hosted version](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/cloud.browser-use.com/>) addresses these challenges by handling proxy rotation, maintaining persistent sessions - so you only need to login once, and allowing you to run as many instances in parallel as you need. We've priced it at $30/month, significantly lower than Operator.
On the open-source side, browser-use remains free and flexible. You can use any LLM you prefer - from Gemini to Sonnet, Qwen, and even DeepSeek-R1. It comes with an MIT license and full customisation options.
This week, we're working on follow-up questions, task reruns, voice mode, and scheduled agent starts. If you want to build automations directly into your products call us, we are happy to explore your use cases and help you set get set up with the API or even custom integration.
**Our vision is simple** : tell your computer what to do, and it gets it done.

We'd love to hear from you. What automation challenges are you facing? How do you think people will interact with computers in the future?

This allows satellite customers to take advantage of the low cost, low lead time, and low effort launches to LEO and have us rendezvous with them in space to transport them to their final destination.

Our high thrust and high efficiency is made possible by a unique cryogenic fuel management system being implemented on the vehicle to keep propellants cold so they don't boil. This allows us to use the same propulsion systems that have been developed by launch vehicles over the last few decades (NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, Relativity Space, ect.).

Ben and Ross met while working together at Relativity Space, where they qualified the cryogenic flight termination valves for the Terran 1 rocket and continued working together on the heat exchangers and turbomachinery for the AeonR engine.

## Meet your newAI employees

## Luna

## Intake Specialist

## New client intake

When a new client calls in, you **want** Luna to pick it up for you. She gathers deep, rich information about the client’s matter while making the caller feel special and heard.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Meet-your-new-AI-employees.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1)

## Book consultations

If a new client is qualified, she urges them to book a consultation. On average, she converts 94% of qualified callers to book a **paid** consultation.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3.png?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1)

## Forwards callers

She forwards callers to the appropriate attorney when needed and knows how to specifically handle new clients, existing clients, opposing counsel, and judges.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Meet-your-new-AI-employees-3.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1)

## Multilingual

She’s just as good in **20+ languages.** Unlock new channels for clients and save on translators.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Meet-your-new-AI-employees-10.png?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1)

## Bob

## Case Analyst

## New matter email

Once Luna passes off the information that she gathered on the phone, Bob sends you an **executive summary email** with contact info, priority level, case summary, and more.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Meet-your-new-AI-employees-5.png?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1)

## Case prioritization

You’re busy, and have more people than you can help seeking your services. When callers call in with new matters, you want to **know who to respond to first**. Bob tells you who and why.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Meet-your-new-AI-employees-4.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1)

## Client Information

He sends you a short and simple synopsis of the caller’s information, clarifying for you which pieces of info he’s sure about and which ones are left unconfirmed by the caller.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Meet-your-new-AI-employees-6.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1)

## Case summary

Bob compiles the most relevant details from Luna’s call so that you can decide what to do about the incoming matter.

## Jess

## Client Manager

## Closes clients

Jess **is a closing powerhouse.** She uses one simple trick to make that happen: consistent, personalized follow-up. She weaves in the lead’s fears and goals with success stories and key differentiators about your firm.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Meet-your-new-AI-employees-13.png?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1)

## Scheduled reminders

Jess makes sure that **clients show up**. She reminds clients of upcoming meetings and tasks that they need to act on, and clients can ask her questions and reschedule times.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Meet-your-new-AI-employees-9.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1)

## Keeps clients engaged

Jess **keeps clients engaged.** She delivers the type of client care and customer service that you’ve always wanted your staff to do.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Meet-your-new-AI-employees-8.png?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1)

## Schedules meetings

When clients ask Luna to schedule a meeting, Jess finds an empty time in your calendar and then checks with you, so you can decide how you want to spend your time.

Caseflood’s AI
solution was a breath of fresh air and a needed solution to allow me to actually grow my practice in
a financially viable way. Without it, I’d either be forced to a super risky place of investing a lot up
front or just knowing that I’d miss out on the 80% of people who hang up before leaving a voicemail.
All the features and turn-key automations with Caseflood are great, but honestly, the demo speaks
for itself.

I'm honored that your team spent a day with us at our firm. We mentioned ideas and you made them a reality within days - I've never had a vendor like that. You're increasing our conversion rates and managing client interactions for us - it just feels like my practice is easier now.

## And we integrate into all your favorite software:

## TheCaseflood.aiProcess

## Onboarding Call

First, meet the award-winning engineering team that will custom-make your firm’s intake system. In 30 minutes, they’ll work with you to pinpoint exactly what you want.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Call-Flow-Builder.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1)

## Be Included in the Process

Once your team of engineers begins working, you’ll receive personal updates on the status of your system.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/4.png?fit=768%2C432&ssl=1)

## Hands-free integration

After learning about your firm, we’ll make sure that our system fits neatly and unobtrusively into the software stack you’re already comfortable with. The process typically takes 3-5 days.

![](https://i0.wp.com/caseflood.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/https___4d04b4137fe2d7f3d0ffb5a70c4ef77e.cdn_.bubble.io_f1718650380819x641911233226300400_Phone20Routing20Graphic.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1)

## You're in!

And just like that, your law firm is leaner, taking on higher-quality cases, and satisfying clients; all while you have more hours in the day to focus on what really matters. You’re using Caseflood.ai.

## TheCaseflood.aidifference

## No admin staff

**Not helpful**

- Miss more calls
- Client frustration
- Inbox overload
- Limited accessibility
- Opportunity costs
- Zero improvement
- Feedback famine
- Admin pileup

## Caseflood.ai

**Oh yeah.**

- 2.1x average conversion rate increase
- Cost savings
- Zero training time
- Working 24/7
- 100% consistent
- No more updating clients
- More 5-star reviews

## Hire (more) staff

**Way too expensive**

- Salary costs
- Training time
- Vacation time and holidays
- Consistency? What's that?
- Benefits bundle
- Scheduling snares
- Desk space dilemma
- Performance variability

## Define


Teams own their data like they own their code. Data owners define a contract, add transformations,
and apply access control rules. Ownership leads to autonomy and speed.


## Integrate


Integrators find data in the catalog. They create derived data from it to enhance their products.
Deep integration creates a cohesive platform.


## Synchronize


ReJot's synchronization engine moves data between teams as soon as it's created. Manual data
fetching and integration tasks are a thing of the past.


* * *

## Use Cases

Examples of how _integration through synchronization_ can help you.

Deep Product Integration
Local-First SoftwareBackend-For-FrontendData Migrations

## Deep Product Integration

At enterprise scale, data is often siloed leading to poor integration between products.
ReJot lets teams expose the operational data created by their product in a data catalog.
Other teams are able to enhance their products with that data. Deep data integration leads
to a more cohesive user experience for the products in your platform.

## Local-First Software

Build responsive frontends that work offline. ReJot can synchronize data from your catalog
directly (or with transformations) to frontend applications. This enables super fast
interactions and live collaboration between users.

## Backend-For-Frontend

Consolidate data from multiple services into a single service that can be consumed by your
frontend. Simplifying the data retrieval and transformation processes.

## Data Migrations

Seamlessly migrate your data between different database systems or schemas while maintaining
data integrity and avoiding downtime. Use ReJot to model new data schemas and migrate to
them while ensuring:

- Zero Downtime
- Data Integrity
- Rollback Safety

* * *

# Benefits

Your organization will benefit from ReJot in these ways.

## Operate as One Platform


Deeply integrate all aspects of your product catalog to create one cohesive platform.


## Fearless Product Evolution


Empower teams to change their product and implementation without worrying about dependent business
units.


## Boost Developer Productivity


Speed up development cycles by cutting down on repetitive integration tasks. Define your data
contracts, and we'll make sure there are no breaches.


* * *

## Say goodbye to...

# Project Management Overhead


Let your product managers focus on talking to users instead of talking to other teams.


# Data Silos


Data is most useful when it’s available to everyone. Publish data seamlessly without compromising on
control & autonomy.


# Reverse ETL


Combine data directly in the operational layer using the catalog of contracts. Stop abusing your data
warehouse.


* * *

## How we integrate

### Bring-your-own-infrastructure


We integrate with the databases you already use and communicate using the infrastructure
that is already present. We don’t force you to integrate with yet another data store,
instead we extract the most out of what you already have.


### Your data, your network


ReJot operates using either a hybrid or self-hosted deployment model. Critical data never
has to leave your infrastructure.


## An Essay on the Burdens of Data

Data is valuable to organisations, but also a burden to software engineers. This essay
is core to the philosophy of ReJot, it explores how to unburden software engineers while
extracting value from data.

# Bild AI – Read and Understand Blueprints using AI
AI that saves builders from late nights drawing on blueprints.

# **tl;dr**
Bild AI reads construction blueprints and extracts material and cost data for builders. Our software automates the $50B/year spent on manual blueprint processing. Watch our demo [here.](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/youtu.be/Brj5QnphFxg>)
# **The Problem**
Working with construction blueprints to get material and cost estimates is a manual process, involving drawing on blueprints by hand. This is time-consuming and prone to human error, which can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in losses per project. It bottlenecks builders and suppliers from winning new contracts as they’re bogged down with the tedious process of bidding. There are massive manual estimation and bidding teams in-house and outsourced.
# **Our Solution**
We're bringing construction blueprints into the present with artificial intelligence. Bild AI ingests blueprint files and applies computer vision models and large language models to calculate detailed material quantity and cost estimates for flooring, doors, hardware and more. Our first clients are using Bild AI to bid on 10x more projects, with confidence in the accuracy of the estimates. This is just one application of blueprint processing that our clients use today, but our vision extends to permitting and architecture checks.

# **We are [Housing|Software] Developers**
[Puneet Sukhija](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/puneet-bild/>) built his first house at 16 and has since overseen hundreds of construction projects, experiencing firsthand the frustration of working with complex blueprints. [Roop Pal](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/rooppal/>) started at Google at 19 before moving to Waymo, where he built computer vision models to interpret complex traffic signal patterns for self-driving cars. They are exited founders applying their experience to automate blueprint analysis—helping builders focus on what matters: building.
# **Our Ask**
We’re scaling our sales! Our first clients are flooring suppliers, but we want to help as many builders as possible so you can:
  * **Intro** us to builders, general contractors, manufacturers.

Hi everyone, we’re Kevin L, Bach, and Kevin H; the founders of Guse!
Guse is an AI doc for any task from planning a trip to working on in depth research and reports. Create your first doc at [guse.io](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/guse.io>).
[](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L2JEhYMmn0>)
📍 **Why are we working on this?**
On my flight back to Philadelphia this past Thanksgiving break, a lady sitting next to me was working on some sort of a report. She had set up a perfect split screen between her Word doc and ChatGPT, and for 6 hours straight I saw as she would copy over some text, paste it into chat, prompt a few times, copy, paste again, google search a few things, rinse and repeat. We’ve all most likely worked in a similar fashion.
But this is a broken way to do work. If you’re working in a doc, you should have all the tools you need and want right there for you. Moreover, the AI tools you use should be powerful enough to tackle the complexity and nuance of the kind of work being done in docs as opposed to the one off questions chat is better suited for.
Unfortunately, no docs tool (GDocs, Notion, Word, etc.) has built out truly capable AI functionality and so chat is still resorted to as the only option for AI tooling. That is until now.
**🏔️ What is our goal?**
We built Guse to not only ensure you never leave your docs for AI tooling ever again, but fundamentally change the way you work and create on a doc. Guse is not just about putting a chat pane in your doc and calling it a day. You should be able to compile entire reports in seconds, generate content and make edits at the speed of thought, and create “docs” that push the bounds on what a doc should even be capable of.
**🚀 So what can Guse do?**
Here are just a few things you can do within a Guse doc:
  1. Ask our composer tool to **“consolidate the most recent news on the fires in LA, exactly which communities have been affected, and specific detail on damages; include some cited reports and images of the fires”**. Composer will autonomously search the web and create all of this on your doc. Then, all you have to do is click accept or deny on the changes.
  2. Highlight any chunk of text on your doc, then query to ask questions or edit. This is completely inline and right in your editor.
  3. Chat pane supporting GPT-4o, Claude, and real time web search powered by Perplexity. Never leave your docs for a chat tool ever again.
  4. Create beautiful docs with our custom blocks such as tables, cards, callouts, images, videos and more. Composer can also work with and use all of these.
  5. Transform any dock into a slide deck. With a single click, you can turn any Guse doc into a fully designed, put together powerpoint slide deck.


Every doc and folder within Guse is collaborative so just share and begin working at [guse.io](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/guse.io>) :)
**Our ask:**
  * If you have any workflow where you find yourself copying and pasting web results or ChatGPT responses into a doc or just working between ChatGPT and a doc, please give Guse a try.
  * If you've tried Guse out and liked it, hated it, or anything in between please let us know at founders@guse.io

### **TLDR**
  * Delineate extracts and analyzes data from biopharma research papers and patents at scale, including data trapped in figures and plots.
  * We are partnered with two top-10 pharma companies where we are performing some of the largest systematic-review studies ever conducted.
  * For our clients we have increased the number of processed studies by 15x compared to industry standard and reduced the time for certain studies from months to weeks.


### **Problem**
90% of drug candidates fail despite billions in pharmaceutical R&D. Making evidence based decisions is crucial to the success of $2B drug pipelines. However to aggregate evidence across hundreds of research papers and patents can take research scientists months of hard labor.
### **Solution**
Delineate has developed custom LLM and computer vision models paired with rigorous QC processes to deliver extremely high quality datasets in a fraction of the time.

#b2b#automation#investments#generative_ai#workflow_automation
Hi all 👋 I’m [Alan](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/x.com/alanwells>), founder of [Rocketable](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.rocketable.com/>).
# tl;dr
I’m building a large portfolio of wildly profitable software businesses by acquiring existing products and replacing human teams with AI agents.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W80DDvHz_wo>
# The longer version…
I started Rocketable because I think that most of the world is still underestimating the potential of AI.
Even in Silicon Valley, most people assume that humans will maintain a monopoly on the creativity and insights needed to operate a successful software product.
I think that’s extremely unlikely.
I believe the real opportunity lies in assuming there is no job in a software company that can’t be automated by AI, and building from there.
### But why are you acquiring existing products?
I believe acquiring existing products is the key to speedrunning the path to building a single person, billion dollar software company.
By acquiring existing software products that already have customers and revenue, I can focus most of my attention on the challenge of automating those businesses.
By owning the products that I automate, I can ignore the management fiefdoms, data silos, and corporate politics that prevent most companies from maximizing the upside of deploying AI in their business.
By buying increasingly larger businesses, I can force myself to climb the ladder of automation complexity faster than most individual businesses evolve organically.
### So what are you building?
Although it’s obvious to me that today’s foundation models already have the raw intelligence needed to do most of the jobs in a large software company, it’s equally obvious that the tools needed to fully replace the entire org chart of a software company with AI agents do not yet exist.
In addition to being competent within each function, to operate software products with 0 human employees, the agents will also need to be:
  * directed towards common goals
  * integrated to collaborate across functions
  * tuned with feedback loops connected to product metrics
  * trained to make resource allocation decisions


Rocketable needs to build the software that enables all of those things to happen. Building the automation system while also owning the products that it operates allows me to:
  * underwrite the risks of early deployment and minimize the cycle time for experimentation
  * connect automation decisions to the outcomes that matter to the business (profitability, growth, retention) rather than intermediate steps in the process.
  * maximize value captured from automation by keeping the upside in-house


There are also significant opportunities to improve the performance of agents (and the customer experience of products they manage) by re-thinking the approach from first principles and ignoring the assumptions that many AI-enabled vertical SaaS products are built upon.
**For example:** instead of automating the typical customer support workflow you see in most companies (where customers interact with relatively low skill tier 1 customer service agents when they have an issue), why not use AI to scale founder-mode support (empowering your AI support agent with access to source code, production databases, and ability to open a PR that solves a customer problem)?
### What makes you think you can do this?
In 2023, I acquired a small, profitable software business on [Acquire.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/Acquire.com>) and started experimenting with using LLMs to automate the business. That experience gave me confidence that with the right approach to automation, there is a clear line of sight to fully automating the operations of a software business.
Prior to working on Rocketable, I spent a decade building products and leading teams that used AI/ML to automate complex tasks. I worked on self-driving cars at Cruise, self-driving trucks and ADAS systems for micromobility at Uber, and an irrigation co-pilot for farmers at Tule (YC S14). Before working on AI-enabled products, I managed traditional B2C and B2B products across web and mobile platforms. I write code, have a degree in design, build hardware, and have also worked on optimizing other complex systems (international supply chains and field operations).
### Maybe you’re not crazy. How can I help or get involved?
**📨 Subscribe to updates:** If you’re interested in following along as I figure out the playbook for running software businesses with teams of AI agents instead of humans, [subscribe here](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/rocketable.substack.com/subscribe>).
**🚰 Help with deal flow:** I’m starting to work on my next acquisition and looking to meet owners of software products that are currently generating $250K-$600K in annual profit who may be interested in selling. If that sounds like you or someone you know, [please contact me here](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.rocketable.com/submit-product>).
**🛠️ Work with Rocketable:** It’s likely that I will need to hire a small team of AI-augmented humans to help build the platform that enables acquired products to operate without employees. If you have the domain mastery and technical skill needed to automate one or more of the critical functions of a software business, [please contact me here](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.rocketable.com/apply>).

Hello! We’re Frances and Prithvi, founders of Promptless.
# tl;dr
Docs are integral to a great customer experience, but managing them is a challenging, multi-team effort. The most successful companies recognize that fantastic docs drive adoption and bad ones cause customers to churn. Promptless is already used by fast-growing startups and Fortune 500 enterprises alike to automatically update docs based on feature releases, support tickets, internal Slack conversations, and more. [Get started today](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/gopromptless.ai>)!
<https://www.tella.tv/video/promptless-automatically-update-your-docs-690g>
# The Promptless Approach
**Promptless drafts updates proactively for easy review**
  * Our AI agents monitor your software changes for when a documentation update might be needed, and can be triggered from a Slack conversation in one click. No prompt engineering required—hence the name _“Promptless”_.


**Promptless lives where you work and can be triggered anywhere**
  * Instead of forcing you into yet another platform, Promptless integrates into your Slack channels, Github repos, Notion databases, Jira/Linear issues, Zendesk/Intercom tickets, and CMS platform.


**Promptless-written docs are designed to maximize value to your customers**
  * Promptless is designed to prioritize accuracy, simplicity, and discoverability—ensuring that your customers can be onboarded quickly and can self-support without reaching out to your team.


**Promptless is built for all kinds of customer docs**
  * Whether your docs are product tutorials, help-center articles, or developer guides, Promptless can handle it, and infers the style and structure of your documentation by reading your entire docs site.

# How Customers Use Promptless Today
Promptless is designed to be flexible—it can integrate with any docs platform, be triggered automatically from many workflows, and can pull in context from any internal knowledge source. Just a few examples:
[Vellum](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/vellum.ai>) (YC W23) has tons of Slack Connect channels with their key customers—they use Promptless to automatically trigger doc updates whenever their team answers a customer question that should be covered in their public guides.
[Clay](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/clay.com/>) (breakout prospecting super tool) has a product team that publishes biweekly changelogs and a content team that manages their guides—they use Promptless to automatically bridge that gap and draft new and updated guides whenever there’s a product update.
A Fortune 500 company has full-time technical writers, but the context surrounding every change is spread across Linear, Confluence, and Slack–Promptless automatically assembles the relevant context and drafts doc updates for every PR, making every technical writer twice as productive.

# Our Team and Expertise
Frances and Prithvi have both run teams where great docs were a critical part of the customer experience. At OneSignal (YC S11) where Frances was Head of Data Science, she saw that docs engagement within the first 24 hours was directly tied to the biggest predictors of customers' lifetime value. At Bond (acquired by NYSE:FIS) where Prithvi was VP of Product and Engineering, he saw the challenging, multi-team effort that it took to maintain great customer docs, and wrote many of the guides himself.

https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/cedar,Cedar,AI automating intake calls and litigation workflows for law firms.,W25,"Law practice is intellectual work trapped in a mesh of administrative tasks. We’re building AI agents that automate pre-litigation workflows for personal injury law firms. 

From AI voice agents that take the initial client intake call to drafting discovery requests and analyzing responses for motions to compel, new workflows can now be automated with the advent of voice and reasoning models.

Personal injury is a $57 billion market in the U.S. alone, with a contingency fee billing model that incentivizes efficiency (unlike other practices of law billed hourly). In high-quality firms, each attorney can make upwards of 3.5 million per year– saving even 1% of their time is significant. We're working on saving >30% of their time.

https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/misprint,Misprint,Misprint is a data-driven marketplace for graded collectibles,W25,"Misprint is an all-in-one marketplace that solves the biggest pain point in the collectibles world: opaque pricing. Collectors, investors, and hobbyists currently rely on scattered data from auction houses, online forums, and reseller platforms, making it difficult to know the true value of their items. Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.

Existing marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint’s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.

Building these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.

The global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.

Co-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor. By merging Goldman Sachs-level financial analytics with top-tier mathematical talent, Misprint is uniquely positioned to become the go-to platform for fair, transparent pricing in the collectibles space.",Active,https://www.misprint.com,2025.0,2.0,,Aaron Epstein,https://www.ycombinator.com/people/aaron-epstein,,,industry:marketplace; industry:consumer; industry:e-commerce,"Eva Herget, Founder","Eva is the Co-Founder and CEO of Misprint.

She left her role as an Equity Analyst at Goldman Sachs to follow her lifelong passion for trading cards, reaching over $500k ARR within three months just by selling Pokemon cards. An alum of the University of Chicago, she studied Economics and East Asian Languages & Civilizations. Eva has published articles in PSA Pop Culture Magazine and TCGplayer Infinite, and also hosts a trading card-focused YouTube channel, Eva’s Binder.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/eva-herget/,"Jonathan Jenkins, Founder","Cofounder/CTO, Misprint (YC W25)

Jon, a mathematician turned card enthusiast, holds a BS and MS in Mathematics from Carnegie Mellon. While pursuing his PhD, he pivoted to theoretical machine learning, publishing numerous papers and studying high dimensional machine learning problems.

#generative_ai#developer_tools
Hi YC! I’m Simon, building **assistant-ui** , an open source Typescript/React library for AI chat.
Hundreds of projects use assistant-ui to build in-app AI assistants, including companies like:
![](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87644&key=user_uploads/1152943/d3eda556-de8c-4404-b4be-c0295f9aeb8e)
With >50k+ monthly downloads, assistant-ui is the most popular UI library for AI chat.
## **Getting Started**
You can get started by running **`npx assistant-ui create`** (new project) or **`npx assistant-ui init`** (existing project) in your terminal.
![](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87644&key=user_uploads/1152943/17c78ae1-d8cf-4fc4-a8aa-056fe449da02)
## **Features**
  * **Pre-built components** , fully customizable
  * **Connects to your backend**
    * We have first class integration for **AI SDK** and **LangGraph** or build your own
  * **Generative UI** : Map LLM tool calls and JSONs to custom UI components
  * **Frontend Tool Calls:** Let LLMs take action in your frontend app
  * **Human Tool Calls:** Human approvals and input collection
  * **Chat history and analytics** via assistant-cloud (the hosted offering)


## **Customization**
The API of assistant-ui is inspired by libraries like **Radix UI** and **cmdk**. Instead of a single monolithic chat component, we give you composable primitives and a great starter configuration. You have full control over the look and feel of every pixel while leaving auto-scrolling, LLM streaming and accessibility to us.

Sample customization to make a perplexity lookalike:

## **Demo Video**
[Demo Video](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/youtu.be/9eLKs9AM4tU?si=jm9GzoFAcyM_tPT->)
## **About**
I’ve wanted to build my own dev tool company since high school. Last year, I built the first version of assistant-ui because I needed the UX of ChatGPT in my own app. The app I was building didn’t work out, but few friends asked me about the chat UI. Since then, AI chat has became increasingly popular as a means for delegating tasks to AI agents. My focus is on enabling human <> agent collaboration through better UX and AX (agent experience).

## Research

A vision-language-action model (VLA) breaks down a high-level goal into an executable sequence of steps. Communication with the robot and its integration is no different than any other AI system—you just tell it what you want it to do in English. We are training highly capable VLAs across different embodiments for a variety of economically-valuable tasks.

As simulators improve, so does the quality of the synthetic data we are able to collect. This presents a promising avenue for increasingly capable models without traditional data bottlenecks.

Hey! Saner, Yash, and Kayla from Trace here.
**TL;DR** : Trace ([tracetec.co](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/tracetec.co/>)) builds voice AI agents to handle customer support for fintechs and banks. Beyond answering generic questions, our AI agents can actually take actions like ""replace my card"" or ""dispute this charge"" while maintaining human-like conversation.
[Here is a quick demo](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/youtu.be/Yh8fIzbHLK4>)
# **Problem**
Customer service is one of the largest operational spends across banks (15% opex), insurance (40% opex), and fintechs. However, call centers offer inconsistent service quality despite the cost.
Existing AI solutions only read off of public documents and deflect the user — they can’t access account-specific data or take actions like human agents would. In financial services, this causes extreme user frustration.
# **Solution**
Trace AI agents securely integrate with core systems to offer instant, 24/7 resolution over the phone. So far, we achieve 95% end-to-end resolution of calls across quoting, card applications, transaction tracking, and more — all while following policy and never leaking sensitive data. With under 0.2s time to first token, we are also optimized for seamless interactions over voice.

# **Team**
We are all ex Stanford/Berkeley researchers, specialized in building reliable AI solutions for high-stakes applications. [Saner](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/saner-cakir-697385300/>) (CEO) built an AI copilot that helped UCSF cardiothoracic surgeons save real lives. [Yash](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/yashvpansari/>) (CTO) was a quant researcher at Optiver and Goldman Sachs, where he enabled millions in annual profitability with his high frequency trading strategies. [Kayla](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/kayla-lee-715149160/>) (COO) led a project at the Berkeley NLP Group that laid the foundation for Trace’s tech.

Onlook’s open-source visual editor was the **[**#1 trending repo**](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/github.com/onlook-dev/onlook/>)** on GitHub, and has over 6.8k stars.**

Here’s a [sneak peak of what it’s like to design with Onlook.](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDity8UrIxE>)
Hey there, we’re Daniel and Kiet, and we’re building Onlook ([onlook.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/onlook.com/?utm_source=launch_yc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=yc_launch>)), the Cursor for Designers.
### **The Problem**
There have been many attempts at solving the problem of design to dev handoff. But for so many tools in the market, there was always compromise. Either the tools were too complex for designers or too cumbersome for engineers to implement.
They were all built to abstract away code, but we’re in a new era of product development—where code isn’t the barrier. The real challenge is giving builders the best way to work with it. In other words, creating things with code has become more of a UX problem than a technical one.
### **Our Solution**
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87467&key=user_uploads/137575/f4e651b1-8cc2-4f41-8512-09500cf2cd0d)
Our product can be best described as a visual IDE – you can either start with building a new app from a prompt, or import your existing NextJS / Tailwind app with Onlook. Once you run your app, you can start designing the interface directly as it’s rendered.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87467&key=user_uploads/137575/7a85a948-73c8-418f-9420-155cdec6d2de)
Want to change a color? Want to move a div? Want to create a new page? You can do it yourself, or ask Onlook’s AI chat to do it for you. Because everything is one-to-one in code, you’re creating the real product with your edits, and you can always right-click to view your code in your preferred code editor.
And, when you’re ready to share your creation with the world, you can host your project through Onlook with just a click.
### **How we got here**
We started Onlook because we had experienced both sides of the design / engineering gap. Daniel has been a designer for over a decade, and Kiet was an engineer at ServiceNow and Amazon working directly with designers.
Kiet reached out to Daniel on YC’s Cofounder matching platform after starting the company in January of 2024, and shortly after we decided to team up and work together. If you’re looking for a cofounder, we [wrote a bit](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/onlook.substack.com/p/how-to-find-a-cofounder>) about that process that you may find useful on our company Substack.
We [launched on Hacker News](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40904862>) and the project quickly earned over 1k GitHub stars. People were compelled by the idea of an open-source visual editor for code, and it felt like the timing was right. Since launching, we’ve continued to refine our editor to make it even better, and have since earned **6.8k stars** , tons of contributions.
Also, Onlook was recently ranked as the **#1 trending repo on GitHub**!

What if AI agents could immediately learn from their mistakes?
## TL;DR
While AI agent capabilities continue to improve, the agentic workflows remain brittle since agents aren’t able to learn from tasks in real-time. Osmosis is a framework that helps your AI agents learn in real-time (similar to DeepSeek R1’s post-training loop) in order to make them better, faster, and more responsive.
On the first run, we scored 21.5% accuracy, which is 60% better than base 4o performance (16X more expensive!). **This means that even on a first run, we're 25X+ more cost effective than base 4o - and that would be significantly better on a second run.** We also averaged 7.5 steps per task while OpenAI Operator averaged 67 steps per task (faster and cheaper!).
If you’re building AI agents and want to make them better, faster, and more responsive, we’d love to chat! Email kasey@gulp.ai or book time [here](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/calendly.com/kasey-gulp/>).
## The Problem
AI agents still struggle with novel and complex (multi-step) tasks. Even OpenAI Operator (current state-of-the-art) just scores 58% accuracy on the WebArena benchmark. The worst part is that agents make the same mistakes again and again!
And even when agents can solve a task, there’s generally a lack of optimization in their process. This ends up negatively affecting performance while also driving up inefficient inference costs for users.
## The Solution
Osmosis builds and maintains a ‘library’ of an agent’s previous interactions. It’s a super simple two line addition in a developer’s agent infrastructure that:
  * Ingests and understand a user’s prompt
  * Queries a vector database to search for similar past scenarios
  * Recommends a relevant plan of action for the task
  * Quantifies an agent’s performance when it finishes, and embeds the assessment


Just like that, we have a flow that enables agents to learn in real-time with each successive task!
Here’s a head-to-head (Operator versus Claude 3.5 Sonnet + Osmosis):
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhFuT8VD9tk>
**Osmosis was 3X faster and 6X more efficient in the number of steps taken!**
## Our Ask
If you (or anyone you know) are building AI agents and struggling with accuracy, speed, or cost, we’d love to chat and see how we can help! Please reach out at kasey@gulp.ai, or book some time directly [here](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/calendly.com/kasey-gulp/>).
## The Team
We’ve (Kasey and Andy) known each other for over a decade!

### **tl;dr**
We work with specialist clinics to identify their biggest administrative blockers and deploy custom **AI** to resolve them. Right now, we’re automating **referral intake** , reducing the time it takes for clinics to process new patients and accelerate revenue collection.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u403AnLMSNE>
### **Problem**
Specialist clinics struggle with **slow, manual referral processing** , leading to revenue delays, administrative overload, and patient drop offs. The biggest bottlenecks we've uncovered:
  * **Referral processing is manual and slow.** Clinics receive **thousands of referrals per month** , requiring extensive manual effort to extract and enter data.
  * **Medical necessity verification is tedious.** Clinics must determine if a referral meets insurance criteria, often requiring **days of back-and-forth with primary care providers** for missing information.
  * **Insurance approvals are a major roadblock.** Clinics waste **days negotiating with insurers** to confirm reimbursement eligibility before scheduling treatment.


These inefficiencies cause **40-60% of referrals to drop off and** costs the U.S. healthcare system **over $150 billion annually**. The administrative burden is also immense, with an average of **4.3 administrative staff per doctor** in the American healthcare system.
### **Solution**

Cenote eliminates the **referral-to-treatment bottleneck** , allowing clinics to focus on patient care while accelerating revenue collection.
  * **Automated data extraction:** We categorize and extract key referral details the moment they hit the clinic’s inbox.
  * **Seamless medical necessity verification:** If critical referral data is missing, our system **auto-requests** the necessary information via the preferred form of digital communication.
  * **AI-powered insurance authorization:** Our **AI callers** handle insurance approvals, freeing clinic staff to focus on higher-value tasks.

## WHAT WE DO

We enable you to run your entire sales deal cycle through a simple conversational interface, built on-top of an end-to-end product suite; use natural language to manage customer relationships, enrich B2B contacts, find high-intent leads, and engage with clients in seconds.

## WHAT WE OFFER

Fuse AI empowers your entire GTM team

# Conversational CRM Interface

Ask our Fuse Agent any command imaginable to simplify your workflow. Learning more about a customer or company? Validating B2B emails? Sending emails at scale? Simply ask and you will receive in seconds.

# Live B2B Contact & Account Database

We've created the world's first “live” database that plugs into 10+ data sources to provided you with real-time, fresh, and accurate data.

# Engagement on autopilot

Fully automated outreach from the first message all the way up-to booking a demos in your calendar, enabling your top performers to focus on closing deals in a demo.

# Buyer Intent Signals

Our platform plugs directly into your website to denanonymize website traffic, so your sales and marketing professionals have real-time data on who to prospect.

## MANIFESTO

Every company requires customers. Without customers, sales simply can't happen. Nowadays go-to-market teams struggle with manual tasks, disconnected tools, and fragmented data due to the archaic software they are operating on. This chaotic approach to go-to-market makes it increasingly challenging to manage and generate leads that convert into high quality customers.

FuseAI isn’t just another sales software tool. We're building the next-gen operating system for revenue teams. We're not claiming to replace your SDRs with terrible email automations or providing you false promises of 100xing your revenue. Our focus is on human amplification - our mission is simple, let's make the best companies and sales professionals 5X better and build a platform that everyone actually enjoys using. We're building for user experience and productivity so your best reps can close 5M in deals annually vs. the traditional 1M target for most companies.

Here a few of the many pain-points we're tackling head on: What if businesses didn't have to spend 6 months evaluating multiple vendors to setup their sales tech stacks? What if they always had access to real-time B2B contact and account data? What if emails never bounced? What if they always knew who their high-intent leads where? What if they didn't have to toggle across several different software tools during the day? What if “Salesforce hygiene” wasn't their number one priority and it was self-updating? What if companies didn't need to spend millions on technical systems architects, and software was actually simple to use, instead of an expensive headache? What if their CRMs automatically recorded, analyzed, and integrated sales call recordings?

Our category defining software is making functionalities such as Real-time B2B Contact and Account Data, Customer Intent, and Multi-Channel Engagement out-of-the-box features within CRM. We're building simplified agentic workflows to re-imagine traditional manual workflows, so you can focus on closing deals.

It's amazing how Salesforce, a $300B empire, has largely grown due to path dependence, with 90% of users dreading to use it daily. We're at the beginning of a techno-paradigm shift with agentic software leading the charge. So here we are, with a bold vision and a relentless drive to make it a reality. We're still writing the story of FuseAI, and I couldn't be prouder of how far we've come—or more excited about where we're going.

If you're reading this, you're already part of the journey. Let's change the game, together.

We’re Antony and Corbin - cofounders of [Artifact](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.artifact.engineer/>)!
In our past life, we built custom Mach 5 jet engines together - with the electrical designs living on iPhone pictures of whiteboards. We’re here to _finally_ bring electrical design tools to the modern age
**The ask:** if you’re a hardware engineer building complex electrical systems, email us at antony@artifact.engineer or [schedule a demo](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/calendly.com/antony-artifact/20min>)!
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvljACPVPLQ&ab_channel=Artifact](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvljACPVPLQ&ab_channel=Artifact>)
# **THE PROBLEM:**
**Electrical system design tools have lagged behind modern-day needs:**
  1. Manually reading datasheets takes too long and is error-prone
  2. Visio, [draw.io](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/draw.io>), or Excel don’t have built-in electrical capability
  3. Linking low and high-fidelity designs is manual and error-prone
  4. Manufacturing drawings are manually drawn and fall out of sync


# **THE SOLUTION:**
**We’re building a single-source-of-truth electrical tool with AI hooks:**
  1. Use our AI datasheet parser to generate pinouts
  2. Embed electrical capabilities (e.g. parts libraries & design checks)
  3. Link Low-fidelity block diagrams and high-fidelity details
  4. Autogenerate manufacturing drawings from system definition

# **TL;DR**
[Pave Robotics](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/pave-robotics.com>) builds robots that seal cracks in asphalt, making road repair cheaper and easier. Our robots work 24/7 and deliver higher-quality results than humans.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87567&key=user_uploads/1490740/f65f62fa-f633-4d9a-8faf-f349f7c0eaec)
# **The Problem**
America’s roads are in crisis. 42% are in mediocre or poor condition, despite $27 billion being spent annually on maintenance. The process of fixing these roads is slow, expensive, and increasingly difficult due to an aging workforce and labor shortages. Moreover, extended road closures for repairs are dangerous and cause major traffic disruptions.
# **The Solution**
Meet Tracer, a fully autonomous robot that performs asphalt crack sealing faster and more effectively than a crew of six people. Tracer operates 24/7, helping paving companies increase efficiency, reduce costs, and minimize road closures.

# **Why start with cracks?**
Crack sealing is the first line of defense against bad roads, but we plan to expand into other forms of road maintenance and paving in the future. We envision a future where roads are continuously kept in pristine condition—and we're building the robots to make that possible.
# **Our ask**
If you know anyone in the following categories we would love an introduction! Email us at founders@pave-robotics.com
  * Paving companies
  * State or local departments of transportation
  * State or local public works departments
  * Private equity firms buying paving companies
  * Large private parking lot or road owners


# **Team**
[Josh Kelly](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/joshak18/>) and [Mason Landon Smith](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/mason-landon-smith/>) met while working for the YouTuber [Mark Rober](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.youtube.com/channel/UCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg>). Josh led the YouTube team as head of engineering, while Mason was the founding product designer for Crunch Labs.
Josh is a Stanford graduate with a background in Mechatronics at companies like Zipline and NASA JPL. Mason graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design and has a strong track record of building successful products and teams that have gone to market and won multiple awards.
Together, they created Pave Robotics, with the goal of revolutionizing the way roads are maintained.

Hey everyone, we’re Andrew and Alan — co-founders of [AthenaHQ.](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.athenahq.ai>)
# **TL;DR**
[AthenaHQ](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.athenahq.ai>) helps companies see how their brand appears on generative engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and more. Make sure your company doesn’t get left behind in the paradigm shift from traditional to generative search.
# **The Problem**
In the past, majority of website visits came from traditional Google Search. Now, sites are increasingly getting it from generative engines like ChatGPT.
From our conversations, we found anecdotally that site traffic attributed to generative engines is increasing month-over-month, picking up in the past few months since the launch of ChatGPT Search in October 2024. **Traditional search engine volume is predicted to drop 25% by 2026, and 50% by 2028** , replaced by traffic originating from generative engines like ChatGPT.

[Exin Therapeutics](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.exintherapeutics.com/>) is developing genetic therapies targeting neural activity for people suffering from neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. We are tackling conditions like epilepsy, debilitating symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Parkinson’s disease by focusing on the neural circuitry of the brain.
# **Why is this important?**
Millions of people around the world suffer from neurological disorders. These disorders arise from imbalances in brain activity. Think of it like an orchestra where some instruments are playing too loud while others are too quiet. This “bad music” / neural imbalance—what we call excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance—is the root cause of many symptoms in these disorders. For example, in epilepsy, overactive circuits lead to seizures, while in ASD, it can cause sensory hypersensitivities - where individuals feel overwhelmed by normal sounds, lights, or touch that most people wouldn't even notice. These dysregulations in neural circuits impact how the brain processes information and responds to the world, leading to the debilitating symptoms we see in these disorders.
# **Our solution**
We’re taking a circuit-level approach to treating brain disorders. Instead of trying to restore missing genes, we’re supplementing already existing genes that we know will be directly changing the neural activity in the brain - in the direction that we want and independently of the genetic background.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=86986&key=user_uploads/89898/4181e602-6279-4611-9af3-73b0ccfca768)
We are also working on an AI model to streamline our preclinical R&D. Here’s why: developing therapies for the brain is hard. Every candidate needs to be tested for its ability to modulate circuits, and doing that through a traditional drug development preclinical pathway is a slow process. Because of that, we use ML to analyze high-density screening data and prioritize which assets are worth testing further. We use neural activity, behavior, and transcriptomics to train multimodal AI models that identify the drivers of the disease, which are not observable by conventional analytical methods.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=86986&key=user_uploads/89898/b1ad1c24-a513-4633-83f6-58378d1cb5d8)
Then, we use these models to (1) predict the potential of our therapies to treat particular indications and (2) provide an efficacy readout during our internal experimental testing. This way, we spend our time (and funding) testing the most promising candidates.
# **Our ask**
  1. Intros: If you have contacts in pharma, working on complementary tech, or have ideas for partnerships, we’d love to connect.
  2. We'd love to hear from people who have worked in therapeutics and people with IND-enabling programs or clinical trial design experience.


# **Team**
We are a team of 3 Oxford-educated neuroscientists. [Gabriel](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-ocana-santero-85b41819a/?originalSubdomain=uk>) is a biochemist with a wealth of research experience in neural development, gene therapy, and NeuroAI.

### **TL;DR**
BlindPay is a stablecoin API that helps companies navigate LatAm's complex financial regulations while enabling fast and affordable global payments. Watch our demo [here](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9hHISlGp9Y>).
### **The Problem**
Businesses face significant hurdles when sending and receiving global payments:
  * Traditional methods rely on correspondent banks, adding fees (1.5-6% for B2B) and delays of 2-5 business days or more. Bank transfers typically require 2-4 intermediaries between smaller countries, with costs reaching hundreds of dollars.
  * Frequent fluctuations in Latin American currencies, coupled with extreme inflation rates (over 50% annually in some countries), make international payments unpredictable and risky.
  * Complex regulations and strict compliance rules across jurisdictions require different documentation for each institution.
  * Fragmented payment landscapes across countries require integration with multiple local payment systems (like SPEI, Pix, PSE), making implementation resource-intensive


### **Our Solution**
Our API integrates seamlessly with your existing workflows. With BlindPay you can:
  * Send and receive payments using fiat money and stablecoins
  * Get competitive FX quotes and low transaction fees
  * Connect directly to local instant payment systems across Latin America
  * 24/7 payments with instant settlement
  * Ensure compliance through blockchain screening, tiered KYC/KYB levels, and continuous transaction monitoring


Expand your global reach while reducing costs and transaction times by up to 80%. Powered by stablecoins and blockchain, our platform eliminates the delays, high fees, and regulatory barriers of traditional payment systems.

### **Developer Experience**
Add fiat gateways to your apps with minimal code. Our SDKs support multiple languages and frameworks, backed by a developer-friendly REST API with public OpenAPI documentation.
  * Support for multiple blockchains and major stablecoins
  * Direct integration with local payment systems like SPEI (Mexico), Pix (Brazil), PSE (Colombia) and Transfers (Argentina)
  * Separate sandbox and production environments with unique API keys and webhooks
  * Real-time payment tracking and transaction monitoring

Benefits
## We help your students learn by helping you teach

02
### Detailed, actionable feedback
GradeWiz generates an entire paragraph of tailored feedback for each student, helping them learn from their mistakes with minimal frustration.
03
### Fair, consistent grading
GradeWiz is completely objective in its grading - it doesn't get tired from late night sessions and it doesn't rush to make it for dinner. Give your students access to the hardest working grader ever.
04
### Tailored teaching
Transform grading data into actionable insights. GradeWiz analyzes student responses to identify common misconceptions and knowledge gaps across your class to adapt your teaching strategy in real-time. 
What people think
## Feedback from Students and Educators
![Humbold](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/humbold-color.svg)
> GradeWiz offers a level of grading automation, rubric generation, and substantive feedback that I have not seen in other teaching tools, AI-based or otherwise. Every teacher wants to give their students detailed feedback on their work but is usually pressed for time to do so. GradeWiz enables you to spend more of your time focused on improving student learning outcomes, rather than manual grading.

### [Can I edit an assignment after it has been created? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)
Yes, you can edit the assignment until it is published. Once published, the assignment cannot be edited. If you made a mistake, you would need to delete it and create a new one. This prevents discrepancies between the distributed assignment PDFs and the updated versions.

### [Can students submit assignments late? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)

GradeWiz uses AI to generate initial feedback on student assignments. This feedback includes comments on key areas such as content accuracy, writing quality, and overall presentation. You can review and edit the feedback to ensure it meets your standards and addresses specific points you want to emphasize.

You can also add new comments to the submission for more personalized feedback.

### [How do I provide an answer key for an assignment? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)

### [How do I delete my account? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)
Go to your profile, select ""Delete Account,"" and confirm. This will permanently delete all associated data, including classes, grades, and submission history.

Hey YC! 👋 We're [Aaron](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/x.com/aaronhetengli>), [Avi](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/x.com/avimakesrobots>) and [Zach](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/x.com/zachdive>) from Adam and we are building AI Powered CAD for mechanical design. Our first launch is our Text to CAD editor. Some of our early users have called it the **Vercel V0 for CAD**. You simply put a prompt in on our web-app and we generate a parametric CAD file for you. Check out our fun promo vid 👇. <https://youtu.be/Pw6KGqgygqw>
**TL;DR:**
  * 🔧 Use our **Text-to-CAD** model to accelerate your mechanical design workflows
  * 🪛 Adjust the **Parametric CAD** with our dynamically generated sliders
  * 🛠 Export and **ready to 3D print in seconds**


### **Problem**
**Slow** Legacy CAD software is weighed down by antiquated UX and outdated geometry rendering from the early 90s.
**Repetitive** Mechanical engineers and design professionals spend hours everyday restarting projects due to rigid workflows. The current tools are clunky and slow to iterate in meaning the iteration process is greatly slowed down.
**Demands significant expertise** The complexity of CAD tools hinders rapid prototyping and wider adoption.
### **Solution**
Design professionals spend hours every week converting ideas into CAD design and its complexity often creates barriers for both professionals and newcomers. The Adam web-app provides a frictionless experience to start rapidly prototyping and shipping out great ideas.
**We support two different modes of interaction**
_1. Conversational design through chat_
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87143&key=user_uploads/1626462/6c4b0839-2b67-4e55-b857-ae6e11f20703)
_2. Parametric edits through sliders_

### **One more thing..**
We are building an Adam Co-Pilot that integrates seamlessly within professional-grade CAD workflows. Think of this as the **Cursor for CAD.** It takes in the context of your CAD environment and is able to make directed edits for you. Check out an early prototype (more on this to come…)! <https://www.loom.com/share/7c945465a21e4fb7abfd557299be4925>
### **We are on a mission to remove the friction between engineering and reality so more great ideas come into existence.**

### **TLDR**
[**Cuckoo**](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.cuckoo.so>) is a real-time AI translator for global sales, marketing, and support. Companies like Snowflake and PagerDuty use Cuckoo in Zoom and in-person meetings for even the most technical discussions.
Here an example of us having a product, sales, and partner meeting with our W25 batchmates and one of our partners in Japan: [**https://youtu.be/7fq7wr_S8p0**](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/youtu.be/7fq7wr_S8p0>)
—
Hey everyone! We are [Yong Hee](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/harryyongheelee/>) and [Gunwoo](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/gunwooterry/>) and we are building Cuckoo to help global teams talk to their customers worldwide. [Give it a try](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.cuckoo.so>) in your next global meeting 🌏
### **Why?**
**Language barriers are a big challenge even for global companies.** We experienced this firsthand in Korea, where we hosted community meetups, inviting product leaders around the world.
On the one hand, many nuances and details can get lost between languages, especially during technical conversations. On the other hand, speakers often felt isolated, unable to follow Korean discussions, and missed valuable opportunities to network and promote their products.
### **Problem**
Take Matt, a Solutions Engineer at PagerDuty APJ, who engages weekly with customers in Korea and Japan. These conversations are complicated not just by language barriers but also by technical details—think complex troubleshooting scenarios.
### **Solution**
**Cuckoo provides real-time translation tailored for you and your customers.** It instantly learns technical details from your documents—pitch decks, meeting notes, API docs—and delivers context-aware translation in 20+ languages.
### **How it works**
Invite Cuckoo to your online meeting. For in-person conversations, you can capture audio directly from your laptop.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87400&key=user_uploads/427995/829469eb-8895-44f0-b686-b2c45bb2f716)
Upload relevant documents (pitch decks, API docs, user manuals, etc.) to help Cuckoo understand the general context and key terms.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87400&key=user_uploads/427995/64f98ba9-db35-43ca-b791-45ca41cd442f)
As the conversation unfolds, your and your customer can view live translations in your preferred languages.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87400&key=user_uploads/427995/cd8cd259-5e60-4bb2-bfd1-808ea19577bc)
### **How our customers use Cuckoo**
We— _our first customer_ —use Cuckoo everyday to demo and collect user feedback. Here’s how other teams use Cuckoo.
  * Snowflake — Hosting global customers at their Customer Experience Centers
  * PagerDuty — Troubleshooting with local cloud partners in Korea and Japan
  * ClickHouse — Team sync between the APAC and HQ office
  * dbt Labs — Webinars for APAC customers and partners
  * Weights & Biases — Hosting Seoul and Tokyo meetups with HQ executives


Cuckoo is also used by enterprises beyond the tech industry, including healthcare (SNOMED), manufacturing (SeAH Steel), and retail (GS).
### **Asks**
Are you dealing with cross-regional operations? Do you work with international customers regularly, or are you planning to expand into new markets?
  * **Try out Cuckoo** at [www.cuckoo.so](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<http:/www.cuckoo.so>) — your first conversation is on us!
  * **Let’s chat!** — We can hop on a quick call—we’ll speak in Korean and Japanese so you can see how Cuckoo works with different languages.
  * [**Schedule a meeting**](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/cal.com/cuckoohq/30min>) — We’d love to learn more about your language challenges and how we can help.
  * **Email us** at [founders@cuckoo.so](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/mailto:founders@cuckoo.so>) — Tell us how your first meeting went, and send any feedback or thoughts!


### **A bit about us**
[Gunwoo](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/gunwooterry/>) and [Yong Hee](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/harryyongheelee/>) first met in 2015 through a student club at KAIST, where we organized an annual international conference for undergraduate students. Since then, we have been talking about starting a company together.

Quantstruct identifies gaps in your knowledge base based on each product release or unfulfilled customer query. It uses multiple AI agents to search existing knowledge sources, test existing docs for validity and style guidelines, and clicks, scrolls, and uses enterprise software through a web browser to generate docs with embedded screenshots and video recordings. Quanstruct is available as a cloud service to start, targeting technical writers, content writing, professional services, and product teams.

# **tl;dr**
Quantstruct is an AI technical writer that improves your documentation 24x7 with agents to research, test, and update your docs. We already work with hypergrowth companies like [Vapi (YC W21)](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/vapi.ai>) and enterprises who build API & SDK products, visual software, and platforms where nurturing a vibrant developer and partner community with bespoke docs helps you win.
[Sign up to get onboarded](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/quantstruct.com>) today!
<https://youtu.be/smbT-M3F1vs>
## **Problem**
The best product & customer teams stomach some difficult truths to serve their customers today:
  1. **Product & customer education demands active effort** from product and engineering experts with limited time
  2. **Teams need to understand too much** source code, support, communication threads & product specs to properly guide customers
  3. **High-quality docs require 100% validation** to test code snippets, external links, accessibility guidelines, take screenshots, and other references. Traditional Gen AI falls short.
  4. **Helping customers supersedes keeping docs up to date**


The result? **Documentation debt** - where your product and technical docs & implementation plans go increasingly out of sync.
We felt this pain thousands of times previously, when we helped Fortune 500 customers integrate with 100s of enterprise software platforms that were poorly documented. We saw how **documentation debt** could escalate customer support issues and lead to customers not adopting and championing the platform.
We also saw how paying down documentation debt could amplify each team’s impact, inspire customer love, and help nurture a community of strongly activated champions.
## **Solution**
Quantstruct connects to your docs platform, GitHub, and Slack to continuously update your docs
  1. When a **PR** occurs, Quantstruct works behind the scenes and notifies you about a companion docs update
  2. Each type of doc update can be configured with tools and agents to

# Lucidic – Analytics and testing platform for rapid agent iteration
Cut AI agent debugging time from days to minutes with visual workflows and simulations

**TL;DR:** Lucidic is an AI agent analytics platform that maps every step of your agent's workflow and simulates their performance at scale, cutting iteration time from weeks to minutes. Instead of sifting through logs, you get a visual breakdown—searchable workflow replays, decision nodes with outcome probabilities, step-by-step agent action trajectories, and side-by-side simulation comparisons.
<https://youtu.be/UI_Y9R_8XHo>
### **The Problem:_Building Good Agents is Hard_**
When we started building agents, it seemed trivial: Call GPT a few times, string together some logic, and it works—until it doesn’t.
The moment you become complex, it’s a disaster. One day, your agent is working fine; the next, it’s breaking for no reason. With misaligned reasoning, brittle logic chains, unclear failure cases, or silent performance degradation, you end up spending hours rerunning prompts, tweaking edge cases, and wondering why something that _should_ work just doesn’t.
And don’t even get me started on debugging. Running the same prompt over and over again, hoping this time it’ll behave the way you want? That’s not a strategy—it’s a nightmare.
### **Our Solution**
Lucidic changes the game. No more late nights staring at a terminal, guessing what went wrong. See exactly how your agent’s brain works—replay actions step by step, inspect decision trees, and visualize internal reasoning in real time. Modify prompts and logic with instant, structured feedback so you’re never debugging in the dark again.
No more trial-and-error fixes—just clear, interactive breakdowns of why your agent fails and how to fix it. Test at scale, compare behaviors side by side and optimize performance before deployment. Intelligently visualize thousands of complete workflow trajectories at once, showing success rates, failure points, and decision paths for faster debugging.

We’re Yash and Ishan, the co-founders of [Ergo](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/joinergo.com/>). Ergo transforms your existing CRM into an autonomous system by connecting natural communication channels like Zoom, Gmail, and Slack. We make platforms like HubSpot or Salesforce fully self-updating so your team can focus on what truly matters—selling.
<https://youtu.be/2aa8cNKyCFE>
### **📉 The Problem**
Manual CRM updates are the bane of every sales team’s existence. Here’s why:
  * **Incomplete records** make forecasting and reporting unreliable.
  * **Missed updates** can lead to $100k+ in lost revenue.
  * **Superficial data** creates friction across sales, onboarding, and customer success.


For sales managers, founders, and account executives, this means wasted hours and missed opportunities.
### **📈 The Solution**
Ergo automates CRM updates & completes tasks pending human approval (e.g., follow-up emails, personalized nurturing).
Here’s what we do for you:
  * **For Sales Managers** : Gain real-time pipeline visibility without chasing your team for updates. Reporting and forecasting has never been more clear.
  * **For Founders** : Save 10+ hours a week and prevent costly pipeline bleed.
  * **For AEs and SDRs** : Focus on building relationships while Ergo handles CRM updates.
  * **For Onboarding and Customer Success Teams** : Access complete customer history without chasing upstream details.


### **⚙️ How Does Ergo Work?**
  1. **Connect Communication Channels** : Link Ergo to tools like Zoom, Gmail, or Slack.

### **🎬 Our Backstory**
Two months ago, Ishan and I were at Georgia Tech working on medical software when we went to Delve (YC W24) for advice. What began as a feedback call turned into an invitation to spend four days in San Francisco with them and join the team. While shadowing them, we saw how 15–20 daily sales calls led to missed follow-ups and poor record-keeping in HubSpot.
Inspired, we built an initial version of Ergo using a 72-step Zapier workflow that retroactively updated their CRM and unlocked and closed $75k in contracts. Encouraged by the results, we expanded the solution to integrate with more communication channels like email and Slack. Back in Atlanta, we tested Ergo with other founders and saw the same widespread problem—CRM management was universally painful.
**Check out the behemoth Zap we built that weekend:**

**TL;DR:** Axiom is building the first platform that lets anyone trade anything in DeFi.
**The Problem:**
  * People in crypto focus too much on the tech rather than the user experience.
  * There are too many protocols and chains.
  * For every new chain and asset, you need to sign up and manage a different account/app.


**The Solution:**
Axiom is building the first app that lets you trade any asset on any chain, with all the technicalities abstracted away. No longer do you have to bridge, swap, manage all your assets through 5 different apps.

# superglue 🍯 - Open Source Data Translation

**Tl;dr** [superglue](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/superglue.cloud/>) translates data from any system into exactly the format you need. It’s an open source proxy that automatically extracts, maps and transforms data so developers don’t have to write and maintain complex integration code.
**Other tools say ""Use our API"". superglue says ""Use any API, in any way you want"".**

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXejwKUtg5vNmIUFVD-naIZc3NVJVO4nIxzG1bVC5SkaA8g5JuhP7I9QWTBXPVCbKQdc6OY7bgFgVuJPf99JjYyBK3Y2TDpGG_ehUirAvBmANq8dkq9EpyY-72Dn56s6dW3LA6n82g?key=X6C0DCn4htyY5GQ3HDPmoqgF)
# **Why it matters**
Most companies struggle with data integration challenges daily. Energy providers pull meter readings from thousands of devices, fashion marketplaces standardize product data from various retailers, and fintech companies normalize transaction data across payment systems. Each system speaks its own language, forcing developers to write and maintain custom code to transform and normalize data. It's a massive waste of engineering resources and slows down business innovation.
# **What we’re building**
_superglue_ is an intelligent proxy server that automatically transforms data from external APIs into your desired format, eliminating the need for custom mapping code. By sitting between your application and APIs, it allows developers to define data structures once and apply consistent transformations across all integrations, turning complex data integration from a weeks-long project into a minutes-long configuration. The superglue proxy can sit outside your codebase - particularly good for legacy systems that are brittle and hard to change.
**Key features**
  * **One-off LLM-powered translations** : Generate deterministic, high-performance translation code.
  * **Self-healing** : Detect format changes and update translations automatically
  * **Fast deployment** : Supports most APIs and data formats out of the box
  * **For enterprise** : Hosting, logging, retries, caches, access control


## **Get Started**
  1. [Get access](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/superglue.cloud/>) to our hosted version or install superglue as a lightweight local proxy
  2. Pick an API / data source to connect to
  3. Define your desired data output format

  1. Let superglue handle transformations and schema enforcement

<https://youtu.be/Bzbw3Oh9zIg>
**How is this different from connector platforms and unified APIs?**
Unlike platforms that offer predefined APIs for specific verticals and require developers to adapt to their specifications, _superglue_ provides universal data transformation that works with any API or data source. We give developers complete flexibility to transform data however they want, without vendor lock-in. Where other platforms support a limited set of integrations, _superglue_ can transform data from literally any source - whether it's a well-known API or a custom internal system - putting developers in full control of their data pipelines.
**What if I want to own the integrations I build?**
You totally can with _superglue_. As an open-source solution, we provide full transparency and the ability to modify transformation logic at any level, ensuring you're never trapped in a black box. Unlike closed integration platforms, you own 100% of the integration logic. You can host the entire solution on your own infrastructure, with full access to source code and transformation rules.
# **Get superglued**
Are you currently building integrations, onboarding customers via integrations or too strapped to integrate them? Email us at [founders@superglue.cloud](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/mailto:founders@superglue.cloud>), we’re happy to help.
Have you built data-heavy integrations in the past? We want to speak to you!

#developer_tools#enterprise_software
Hey everyone, I’m Nand - Founder at Axal👋 We built a tool that uses deterministic methods to **automate the hardest parts of application modernization** — identifying architectural bottlenecks and prioritizing those issues based on business value. Once the issues are broken down by Axal, AI can autonomously collaborate with your team to resolve them.
# **The Problem**
Everyone knows that software teams cut corners in development over time, resulting in accumulation of debt tech overtime that slows them down and raises costs. Until now, to address this problem there needed to be long modernization efforts, where stakeholders spent months finding possible solutions to the problem, if you could even find and train the team members needed to do the work.
# **Our Solution: One platform for Application Modernization**
Axal uses deterministic methods to provide teams with clear observability into architectural technical debt.

We show tech debt scores tailored to your goals. For example, if maintainability is your focus, we display the maintainability index, aligning business impact with priorities to guide effective action.
Technical teams can leverage our graphs to gain clear insights into class-level and domain-level codebase relationships.
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=86865&key=user_uploads/570999/ceaeb77c-b33c-4ef2-8540-3e5fc5f564d2)
Architectural issues - domain exclusivity, circular dependencies, dead code, etc. - are automatically detected based on the goals that an organization makes, and engineers can work with Axal to assign their priority.

Once prioritized, **Axal leverages AI to autonomously address issues** , while ensuring none of the existing code breaks.

# Pickle - AI Body Double for Video Calls
Pickle joins Zoom calls on your behalf and makes you look great.

# **tl;dr**
Pickle replaces your Zoom camera with a virtual body double that always looks great—even if you're calling in from bed.
# **Why we’re doing this**
Daniel attended 10‑hour Zoom classes daily when he was a medical school student. He experienced extreme Zoom fatigue and discovered that it wasn’t just because he hated listening to boring medicine lectures—it also caused [neurophysiological](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45374-y>) problems. We imagined there must be [countless people](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/<https:/www.reuters.com/article/us-zoom-video-commn-encryption-idUSKBN22C1T4/>) suffering from the same issue, desperate to escape the Zoom prison.
<https://youtu.be/cCdZX6hxJpI?si=f3RCtpSQiquAbmCs>
# **Who’s using Pickle?**
Since launching Pickle last October, we’ve interviewed over 400 Picklers worldwide. What surprised us was that not only were people experiencing Zoom fatigue from back-to-back meetings, but even those **who wouldn’t turn on their camera** for a single call were using Pickle.
Engineer moms who have to care for their kids, new employees with severe anxiety disorder, and CEOs who want to look professional no matter where they are—all these people found Pickle essential for their daily work. We realized that Pickle isn’t just a vitamin—**it’s a painkiller**.
# **The lowest latency human model**
![](https://www.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=87621&key=user_uploads/2376609/95f16234-6efd-417b-880f-b00310ccbdbd)
We developed an ultra-fast human model that processes voice input and generates output in **under 0.3 seconds**. This enables a user’s Pickle to lip-sync almost simultaneously with what they say. Moreover, as our user base grows, our model rapidly upgrades thanks to the influx of data.

We’re building an AI Analyst for Electricity Markets, starting with the owners of grid-connected battery projects. <https://www.loom.com/share/8b4a7f0bbe5042679f28bb1c6c498c01?sid=2e96b889-041b-4c50-aea1-dabaaa7fecef>
**Context**
Battery owners earn revenue by charging (buying) and discharging (selling) power in electricity markets.
The goal is to maximize revenue within constraints – some of which are physical, like battery capacity, duration, and efficiency, while others are regulatory. This is challenging because (1) markets are volatile and (2) complex and frequent regulatory updates make it difficult to assess both the revenue impact of rule changes and compliance risks.
**Problem**
To make money on the grid, battery owners must analyze market data and keep up with thousands of constantly changing regulatory documents. Electricity markets work like auctions -- every 5 minutes, battery owners decide how much power to buy or sell and at what price. Even the most data-savvy teams can’t keep up, leaving owners with little visibility into how others are making money. And rule changes aren’t just small tweaks – they can completely upend the market. To avoid financial penalties, battery owners spend millions on lawyers and consultants just to stay compliant.
**Solution**
Dartboard is an AI Analyst that uncovers missed revenue for owners of grid connected batteries while ensuring compliance. We provide value in two key ways:
  * **Market Intelligence:** We ingest historical market data so that owners can evaluate optimization strategies and uncover money they might be leaving on the table.
  * **Regulatory Guidance:** Our AI Analyst, trained on the latest rule changes, translates complex regulations into clear, actionable insights — helping owners navigate compliance without the need for expensive consultants.


**Asks**
If you know any developer/owner/operators of grid-scale battery projects, energy traders, or energy-focused private equity investors, we’d love to meet them. Please reach out at **rohun@dartboardenergy.com**.
