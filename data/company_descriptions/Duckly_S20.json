Their mission is straightforward: to facilitate video chat combined with real-time collaboration, enabling teams to work together as if they were side-by-side‚Äîno matter where they are in the world.\n\nDuckly‚Äôs approach is refreshingly simple and user-friendly. By sharing a straightforward URL, teams can instantly jump into a collaborative environment. Users can share websites, collaborate on code right from their IDE, and even share terminal sessions for interactive work. All this is backed up by high-quality audio and video chat.\n\nAt its core, Duckly provides a robust set of tools designed for real-time, remote collaboration. The platform encourages developers to stop coding alone, fostering a more interactive and productive workflow. \n\n#### Key Features:\n- **Multi-IDE Collaboration**: Whether you‚Äôre using VS Code, IntelliJ, or any other IDE, Duckly lets you share your coding environment in real-time, allowing everyone to contribute effectively.\n- **Real-Time Sharing**: You can see other developers' cursors and changes in real-time, promoting a fluid collaborative process.\n- **Embedded Audio & Video**: Integrated audio and video chat means discussions can happen right alongside the work, reducing the need to switch between different apps.\n- **Security**: With end-to-end encryption and peer-to-peer connections, Duckly takes security seriously.\n\nIn addition to coding together, Duckly simplifies the code review process. Instead of going it alone, developers can interact directly, speeding up feedback and revisions.\n\n#### The Community\nDuckly has caught the attention of many companies and developers alike. Teams from various organizations are using Duckly to enhance their collaborative efforts, praising its high-quality experience. Users rave about its ease of use and how it has significantly improved their remote coding sessions.\n\nWith a small but dedicated team of five and backed by Y Combinator‚Äôs S20 batch, Duckly is well-positioned to push boundaries in the developer tools space.\n\n#### In Summary\nDuckly isn't just another collaboration tool; it‚Äôs a game-changer for teams that value real-time interaction and streamlined workflows.
