We use LLMs to empower billing teams to turn their manual claim QA into automated correctness checks.  Co-founders Chris and Jorrie are MIT computer science grads and went on to work at Google, where they used similar applied AI techniques to automate content moderation workflows and prevent real-world threats.  Within a month of launching with our first client, an ophthalmology practice with 8 clinics and 4 surgery centers, Chorrie has already flagged over $300k of claims that were either under-billed, or would've been denied.

  "generated_description": "**Chorrie: Revolutionizing Medical Billing with AI**\n\nFounded in 2024 and based in New York, Chorrie is on a mission to eliminate medical claim denials and prevent underbilling in healthcare through cutting-edge AI technology. Co-founders Chris and Jorrie, both MIT Computer Science graduates, bring their experience from Google, where they applied AI for advanced content moderation. They’ve channeled this expertise into building a no-code platform that empowers medical billing teams, allowing them to transition from manual quality assurance processes to automated checks for claim accuracy.\n\nWithin just a month of launching with their first client—a multi-clinic ophthalmology practice—Chorrie flagged over $300,000 in potentially denied or under-billed claims. That's some impressive ROI right off the bat.\n\n### What Makes Chorrie Stand Out:\n\n- **Seamless Integration:** Chorrie doesn’t require clients to switch platforms. Their tools can be integrated into existing practice management systems without the costs and frustrations of training.\n  \n- **Pay-for-Performance Model:** They’ve adopted a no-risk pricing structure. You only pay for the claims they flag as incorrect—no flat fees, just results.\n\n- **HIPAA Compliance:** Patient data security is paramount. Chorrie is HIPAA-compliant, ensuring that no patient data is used to train their models without individuals’ consent. They offer zero-retention options to keep data safe.\n\n### Why It Matters:\n\nIn the healthcare landscape, where billing errors can lead to significant revenue loss and operational headaches, Chorrie provides an essential service. By automating claim checks, they allow billing teams to focus on what really matters—providing excellent patient care rather than getting bogged down in revenue cycle management challenges.\n\nChorrie is part of Y Combinator's Batch F24—an indication of their potential for growth. With just a two-person team and a strong backing, they’re poised to improve billing processes across the healthcare industry.\n\nIf you want to learn more or see Chorrie in action, check out their website at [chorrie.com](https://chorrie.com) and consider booking a demo."
