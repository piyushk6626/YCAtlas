With flight delays an everyday reality for many, AirHelp thrives on tackling these challenges head-on, utilizing a potent mix of talent, passion, and persistence. In fact, every AirHelper is empowered to propose and implement innovative ideas that could shape the company’s future—a unique opportunity in the startup realm.\n\nWith a team of around 350 employees and expertise spanning various departments like tech, product, legal, and customer service, AirHelp is not just another company; it’s a learning ground. Whether your skills lie in coding or customer outreach, there’s a niche for you here.\n\nNow, let’s talk numbers. AirHelp has facilitated compensation for over 2.7 million passengers, checked more than 180 million flights, and accumulated a stellar 167,000+ five-star reviews from satisfied customers. They operate under regulations such as the EU Regulation EC 261 and the Montreal Convention, ensuring travelers know their rights.\n\nThe process is simple: passengers can claim up to $650 without any upfront fees—AirHelp only takes a percentage from the compensation when successful. This no-win, no-fee model means there’s essentially nothing to lose for travelers.\n\nIf you’re looking for a place where you can make an impact on a global scale while helping everyday people navigate the complexities of air travel, look no further.
