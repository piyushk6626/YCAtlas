  "description": "We’re on a mission to leverage AI and voice technology to solve inefficiencies and revenue leakage in our healthcare system. With the rise of EHRs, the manual documentation burden on doctors has never been higher, leading to burnout and fatigue and high attrition rates. Assigning the correct diagnosis and billing codes is crucial for proper reimbursement and patient care, but medical coding is becoming more and more complex each year with growing numbers of codes (over 145,000 now), and doctors are unsupported by current technology to keep up with its ever increasing requirements. $125 billion is left on the table each year by healthcare organizations due to improper documentation and coding. \r\n\nKnowtex creates visit notes with up-to-date and accurate reimbursement codes from doctor-patient conversations, allowing the doctor to focus on patient care and preventing revenue leakage for hospital systems through standardized, transparent, and accurate documentation.",

The potential is enormous.\\n![Dr. Alexandra Caracitas⟨13⟩].avif)\\nDr. Alexandra Caracitas\\nDO, Primary Care\\nIt is easy to use and I like the feature of being able to record/add to the note after the visit with the patient, before uploading to OncoEMR. I did a few visits with patients that only spoke Portuguese and the translation was accurate. All of the patients consented to being recorded and using Knowtex.\\n![Aysha Khalid⟨14⟩].avif)\\nAysha Khalid\\nMD, Oncologist\\nAt the end of the day I don’t want to go home with 30 notes and that’s not happening now [with Knowtex] which I’m happy about.\\n![Luis Jaramillo⟨15⟩].avif)\\nLuis Jaramillo\\nMD, Plastic Surgeon\\nKnowtex does great with the clinic notes. Today I had an impressive result with a very complex conversation about cancer mastectomy in Spanish. The note came out fantastic. Knowtex also works with operative note dictations. I did a recording in the car with background noises and airpods and it was perfect. It blew my mind.\\n![Ephraim Dickinson⟨16⟩].avif)\\nEphraim Dickinson\\nMD, Orthopedics\\nWith Knowtex, I no longer have to spend hours after appointments typing or dictating notes. I can just have a natural conversation with the patient, and it automatically turns it into a detailed and accurate note with ICD-10, CPT, and E&M codes. I’m saving time on documentation and admin work, which means I can see more patients, have better work life balance, and deliver better care.\\n![Deborah Wong⟨17⟩].avif)\\nDeborah Wong\\nMD, Emergency Medicine\\nI\\'m a Knowtex convert, even though I\\'m a fast typer. I now use it for my initials and everything. Charting is so much better with Knowtex.\\n![Raymund David⟨18⟩].avif)\\nRaymund David\\nMD, Neurology\\nI\\'m using Knowtex for all my patients. It\\'s really good. I\\'m really impressed. The way it communicates [the conversation] is really nice and it\\'s fun to read. Before I had to stop and take notes in between each patient, now I can see patients one after the other and not worry about the note.\\n![Gordon Lundy⟨19⟩]\\nGordon Lundy\\nMD, Orthopedics\\nI used to be catching up on notes every night at home [before Knowtex], and now I can exercise and spend time with my grandchildren. Having accurate notes saves me from dealing with insurance too. It\\'s way ahead of the curve.\\n![Sukhjeet S. Batth⟨20⟩]\\nSukhjeet S. Batth\\nM.D., M.S., DABR. Radiation Oncology, Board Certified\\nI love it. I don’t have the mental energy to rehash everything through a voice-text system after I’m done [seeing patients]. Using Knowtex is less energy draining, and less tiring. It’s saving me 3-4 hours when I’m seeing new consults and also helps with extended follow-ups.\\n![Gregg Nicandri⟨21⟩]\\nGregg Nicandri\\nOrthopedic Surgeon, Chief Medical Information Officer\\nKnowtex significantly reduces the tremendous burden of admin work and improves wellness, which allows me to see more patients and generate more revenue. The technology pays for itself and it provides me the opportunity to truly focus on my patients - to listen, to empathize, and to educate - rather than being preoccupied with typing and clicking on a computer.\\n![Michael Gruttadauria⟨22⟩]\\nMichael Gruttadauria\\nPodiatry\\nI dictate the exam a lot. I bring Knowtex into the room for HPI, and will do [the] exam while patient is talking to me. Then when the I leaves the room, I will quickly dictate the physical exam, and any imaging findings so it basically will get the HPI, assessment, and plan. I often see more than 40 patients a day and Knowtex has saved me an immense amount of time.\\n![Susan McDowell⟨23⟩]\\nSusan McDowell\\nOrthopedic Oncologist\\nSince I started using Knowtex, I\\'ve been able to close my clinical notes much more efficiently. For a new patient visit, it used to take me about 20-25 minutes to manually dictate a note. But with Knowtex, it cuts my documentation time down by half, if not more than that. On days when I\\'m using Knowtex consistently for all my patient visits, I\\'m now able to close all my notes by the end of clinic. The time savings have been really significant and make such a difference in my productivity and workflow.\\n![Benedict DiGiovanni⟨24⟩]\\nBenedict DiGiovanni\\nOrthopedics\\nI feel as if it is it returned the joy of connecting with patients in the room and not being distracted. I think the patient felt that and I also felt that.\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\nWhat makes Knowtex different?\\nKnowtex runs on proprietary AI models built to optimize specialty-specific information.

  "generated_description": "**Knowtex: Revolutionizing Healthcare Documentation with AI**\n\nFounded in 2022 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S22, Knowtex is on a mission to enhance the efficiency of healthcare professionals. With a headquarters in San Francisco, the company aims to make doctors twice as efficient through advanced AI-driven note-taking and charge capture technologies.\n\nThe healthcare industry is facing a crisis. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have introduced a massive documentation burden, leading to doctor burnout and high attrition rates. In fact, a staggering $125 billion is lost annually due to inadequate documentation and complex medical coding—which now boasts an overwhelming 145,000 codes. To tackle these challenges, Knowtex leverages AI and voice technology, transforming doctor-patient conversations into detailed notes and accurate billing codes.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Automated Workflows**: Knowtex eliminates the tedious administrative tasks, saving clinicians over two hours a day by generating detailed notes directly from conversations.\n- **Accurate Billing**: Instantly creates ICD-10, E&M, HCC, and CPT codes tailored to the complexity of the interaction, ensuring providers get paid what they're due.\n- **Multilingual Capabilities**: The software can understand accents and dialects from over 99 languages, making it accessible to a diverse range of patients.\n- **Easy Integration**: Knowtex integrates seamlessly with most EHR systems, allowing for smooth transitions and historical data synthesis.\n\n### User Testimonials\nThe voices of satisfied users are powerful. Doctors report significantly reduced time spent on documentation, allowing them to focus more on patient care. For example, physicians have noted improvements in their work-life balance, with many expressing joy in connecting more deeply with their patients during visits instead of being distracted by typing notes.\n\n### The Impact\nBy providing a streamlined, AI-powered solution to documentation and billing, Knowtex addresses a critical pain point in healthcare. As clinicians become more efficient, they can devote more attention to patient care, ultimately improving outcomes and satisfaction for both doctors and patients.\n\n### Interested in Learning More?\nIf you're intrigued by the potential of AI in healthcare and want to explore how Knowtex can transform your practice, they offer a free 7-day trial with unlimited notes. You can start here: [Get Started with Knowtex](http://www.knowtex.ai/).\n\nIn the landscape of healthcare technology, Knowtex is not just another tool—it's a paradigm shift toward smarter, more efficient medical practice. The future of healthcare documentation looks promising, and Knowtex is leading the charge."
