  "generated_description": "Ascen is a Boston-based startup founded in 2018, currently operating with a nimble team of 17. This company emerged as a back-office platform and employer of record (EOR) specifically catering to the staffing industry. Ascen is a proud participant of Y Combinator's Batch W19, which adds a layer of credibility to its innovative offerings.\n\nThe core mission of Ascen is straightforward: to act as an employer of record for staffing firms, allowing those firms to focus on their core business. The services provided by Ascen cover a broad spectrum. They offer not just EOR services but also payroll funding, compliance solutions, and a comprehensive pay-and-bill software tailored for staffing agencies. Ascen has designed its platform to be an all-in-one solution that integrates easily with various Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and other software.\n\nWhat does this mean for staffing firms? They can utilize Ascen's solutions to streamline several operational headaches—everything from onboarding, background checks, and payroll to invoicing and compliance. By offering a white-label product, Ascen empowers staffing agencies to maintain their branding while automating back-office functions. \n\nAscen's offerings are grouped into three primary products:\n1. **Employer of Record (EOR)** - This service ensures compliant onboarding, payroll, and other benefits as Ascen acts as the legal employer of the staffing firm's candidates.\n2. **Agent of Record (AOR)** - Here, Ascen helps manage independent contractor compliance, ensuring proper classification and overseeing payments.\n3. **Pay and Bill Software** - This allows staffing companies to manage all their payroll and billing needs under one roof, maintaining control over their operations.\n\nWith tags like 'SaaS', 'B2B', 'compliance', and 'HR-tech', Ascen is positioned at the intersection of technology and human resources, aiming to simplify complex staffing processes. Their ongoing commitment is to evolve further, integrating more solutions that can adapt to the shifting landscape of the staffing industry.\n\nFor more details, you can explore their offerings on [Ascen's official website](https://ascen.com)."
