  "description": "We are disrupting hospitality hiring by reducing the time it takes to hire staff from months to < 3 days.\r\n\nHiring staff is the biggest challenge for many of the 2M+ hospitality businesses in Europe. Covid and Brexit ceased the usual oversupply of candidates, making traditional job boards unable to meet employers' needs, and agencies more expensive than ever. As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.\r\n\nAt Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.\r\n\nTo date, weâve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders.",

  "generated_description": "### Hirebolt: Changing the Game in Hospitality Hiring\n\n**Mission Statement**: Hirebolt aims to help businesses hire staff quickly, eliminating hours of tedious administrative work. The company, founded in 2021, seeks to revolutionize how hospitality businesses recruit, shortening the hiring process from several months to under three days.\n\n#### The Problem\n\nFor over 2 million hospitality businesses in Europe, hiring is a massive challenge, compounded by the effects of COVID and Brexit. With fewer candidates available, traditional job boards are failing to deliver qualified applicants, leading to manual candidate sourcing and unnecessary filtering through irrelevant CVs. To make matters worse, about 80% of candidates invited to an interview don’t even show up.\n\n#### The Solution: Hirebolt\n\nHirebolt streamlines the hiring process by leveraging AI technology to find and vet actively-looking candidates. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Businesses specify their hiring needs.\n2. Relevant candidates are delivered directly, often through WhatsApp, the same day.\n3. Employers can review candidate profiles and Hirebolt handles the rest—scheduling interviews and reminding candidates to show up.\n\nThis efficient system frees up employers' time, allowing them to focus on their core operations instead of getting bogged down in the hiring process.\n\n#### Backed by Strong Investors\n\nTo date, Hirebolt has raised around $1.5 million from reputable investors, including Y Combinator and other prominent venture capital firms. Being part of the Y Combinator Batch S21 underscores their potential in the tech and HR landscape.\n\n#### A Focused Team\n\nLocated in London, Hirebolt operates with a lean team of just three employees, including co-founders Alex and Lorenzo, who have experience developing technology solutions for local businesses.\n\n#### Why Hirebolt?\n\nEmployers benefit from:\n- **Vetted candidates delivered daily** – Minimizing the time wasted on irrelevant job board applications.\n- **Cost-Effectiveness** – Hirebolt claims to be approximately 26 times cheaper than traditional recruitment agencies while giving employers full control over the hiring process.\n- **Employer Support** – They chase candidates for interviews and provide insights into no-shows, addressing a critical pain point for businesses.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nHirebolt is addressing a significant void in the hospitality hiring market—one that’s only grown more pressing as traditional methods falter. By fusing tech with recruitment, they’re not just streamlining processes but fundamentally changing the way businesses think about hiring. If you’re in hospitality and tired of the sourcing grind, Hirebolt might just be the solution you've been waiting for.\n\nFor more information, visit [Hirebolt's website](https://hirebolt.com/) and take the first steps towards a more efficient hiring process."
