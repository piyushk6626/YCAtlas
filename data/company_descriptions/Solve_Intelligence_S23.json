  "generated_description": "**Solve Intelligence: Revolutionizing Patent Drafting Through AI**\n\nFounded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch S23, Solve Intelligence is reshaping the landscape of patent law with its cutting-edge AI technology. The mission? To streamline the entire patent lifecycle for legal teams, making the process of drafting, prosecuting, and harvesting patents not just more efficient, but also more intelligent.\n\n**What They Offer**\n\nAt its core, Solve Intelligence provides a user-friendly, in-browser document editor that patent attorneys can dive into immediately. Think of it as the Google Docs of patent drafting, but with an AI copilot that enhances the user’s capabilities. This tool is tailored to assist with every phase of the patent process—from initial drafting and filing to prosecution and opposition.\n\n**Efficiency Meets Customization**\n\nTheir product stands out by not only increasing drafting efficiency—users report improvements of 60-90%—but also allowing for a high degree of customization based on specific legal requirements, styles, and regional nuances. This adaptability means that legal professionals can focus more on the substance of their patents and less on the mechanical aspects of writing.\n\n**Security First**\n\nWith so much sensitive information at stake, Solve Intelligence doesn’t take security lightly. Their platform adheres to strict regulations and certifications, including SOC 2 and GDPR. Notably, they never train their AI on user data, ensuring absolute confidentiality and peace of mind for legal teams.\n\n**A Growing Team**\n\nOperating out of an unnamed location, Solve Intelligence is small yet mighty with a team of nine and guided by Group Partner Tom Blomfield. Their collective experience and passion drive the continuous evolution of their product, bringing new features on a regular basis that further enhance workflow and patent quality.\n\n**Feedback from the Field**\n\nThe testimonials from users speak volumes. Legal professionals have described the platform as \"incredibly powerful\" and a \"game changer,\" highlighting how it allows them to reclaim valuable time and improve the quality of their outputs.\n\nFor those looking to stay competitive in the fast-evolving world of patent law, Solve Intelligence is a tool well worth exploring. Whether you're drafting a fresh patent or navigating complex legal waters, having AI as a copilot can make a world of difference. \n\nDiscover more about their technology and request a demo at [Solve Intelligence's website](https://www.solveintelligence.com)."
