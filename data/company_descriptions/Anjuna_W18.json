  "description": "Anjuna makes hardware-grade application and data protection simple, fast and enterprise-ready. Anjuna software enables IT to “lift and shift” applications and data into the hardware-encrypted confines of a secure enclave, protecting them from malicious software, insiders, and bad actors. Available from every major chip, cloud, and system vendor, secure enclaves are the data security gold standard. Unlike point memory-only enclave solutions that require expensive and complicated software rewrites, Anjuna enables enterprises to achieve managed enterprise-class enclave protection that span memory, storage, networks, and clouds in minutes--without recoding. Anjuna is based in Palo Alto, California.",
