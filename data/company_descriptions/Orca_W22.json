  "generated_description": "**Orca: Banking for Gen Z on Steroids**\n\nFounded in 2021 and rooted in Austin, TX, Orca is here to revolutionize the way Gen Z interacts with money. It emerged from Y Combinator's Batch W22 with a bold mission: to create a financial platform designed specifically for the needs of a new generation—what they call \"banking on steroids.\" \n\nOrca's features are tailored for the fast-paced lives of young people. It allows users to send money instantly to friends, split bills effortlessly, and access exclusive local discounts and perks—all from a single app. Think of it as *the* financial hub that has everything you could possibly ask for at your fingertips.\n\nRight now, Orca primarily operates on the UT Austin campus, appealing to students who want instant payments and enticing cashback offers on local restaurants. They are clearly laser-focused on their target market, encouraging non-UT students to join a waitlist for the future expansion of their services.\n\nWith a small but passionate team of four, Orca embodies the spirit of innovation and community. Supported by notable investor Brad Flora and backed by Y Combinator, they are set on reshaping how Gen Z thinks about spending and saving money.\n\nIn summary, if you're a student feeling a little overwhelmed by traditional banking, Orca is designed to make life simpler, with easy transactions and benefits that resonate with a younger audience. They’re making financial services more relatable and accessible—what’s not to love? \n\nFor more information or to join the waitlist, check out their website: [Orca](https://orca.fyi/)."
