Founded in 2012 and hailing from Oakland, California, this innovative company is the first online platform specifically devoted to booking luxury hotel suites and connecting rooms. If you've ever traveled with family or a group of friends, you'll know that finding the right accommodations can be a headache. Suiteness takes that hassle away, allowing you to book guaranteed connecting rooms and suites that accommodate everyone's needs without compromising comfort or style.\n\nPart of the renowned Y Combinator's Summer 2016 batch, Suiteness has carved out a unique niche in a saturated market by focusing solely on luxury accommodations, making it a go-to resource for families and groups looking for upscale travel experiences. Their website showcases an impressive inventory of exclusive hotel suites across myriad destinations, including hot spots like Las Vegas, New York, Los Angeles, and Orlando, among others.\n\nAt its core, Suiteness champions the notion that travel should be enjoyable, not stressful. Their user-friendly site allows for searching connecting rooms easily—just look for the special “+” in the room names. With a team of only 7 employees but a vast reach into over 3,700 destination options, Suiteness is small in size but mighty in ambition.\n\nAdditionally, they also take social responsibility seriously. Suiteness donates 1% of its proceeds to local charities, exemplifying a commitment to give back while facilitating unforgettable travel experiences for its customers.\n\nSo, if you’re dreaming of a luxurious getaway that allows your group to stay connected, Suiteness is your ticket to convenience and indulgence.
