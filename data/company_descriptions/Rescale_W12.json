efficiency across our many areas of R&D from offshore to renewables. Rescale streamlined our cloud transformation and continues to help us find new ways to improve our engineers’ productivity and develop new products faster.”\\n![](https://rescale.com/wp-content/uploads/national-oilwell-varco-nov-vector-logo-1.svg)\\nMatthew Robinson, Engineering Systems Administrator\\nNov\\n“Our Investments in digital R&D partners like Rescale ultimately helped us produce an aircraft that is 100x safer, 100x quieter, and at a fifth of the cost from what was previously possible.”\\n![](https://rescale.com/wp-content/uploads/Vertical_Aerospace_Logo.png)\\nMadhu Bhabuta CIO\\nVertical Aerospace\\n“With Rescale we are able to explore the entire design space. We have engineering problems that benefit from specific classes of hardware, so it’s a big help that Rescale allows you to set up architectures on the fly at the time of compute.”\\n![](https://rescale.com/wp-content/uploads/daikin-logo-1-1024x213.png)\\n**Sudip Mukerji, Principal Engineer**\\nDaikin Applied\\n“Our clients’ technical complexity demands are growing, so we need to have the computational capabilities to support them. Having access to HPC on-demand through Rescale is a game changer- our largest job we saw a 5-10x increase in speed of computing. We can now take on larger client projects and don’t have to make compromises”\\n![](https://rescale.com/wp-content/uploads/exponent-plus-1.png)\\nZach Owens, Senior Managing Engineer\\nExponent\\n##
