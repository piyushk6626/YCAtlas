By subscribing, our customers have access to the latest tech from the best brands for budget-friendly monthly payments. Our mission is to help the world embrace the circular economy and say goodbye to the days of owning expensive tech devices. It’s a learned behaviour that we need to disrupt to usher in a new era where subscribing, rather than buying, is the norm. We’ve seen this trend with luxury handbags, clothes and cars. There’s no surprise that tech is the next big trend here. Our disruptive challenge to traditional tech device ownership may seem ambitious, but hey - look at how Netflix and Spotify transformed the consumption of movies and music. The planet needs us to change how we think about our phones, laptops and other devices.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977a89f4eaba465d13ac2_Diagram.png)\\n## How we do it\\nA circular economy is a sustainable approach to production and consumption. Rather than following the \"take-make-waste\" linear model, the circular economy aims to reduce waste and protect the environment. We’re all addicted to our devices (and that’s ok), but what we’re actually addicted to is the lifestyle they allow us to live and the connections they help us make. We don’t need to own the device to do this. Circular is helping people embrace a forward thinking approach where we are custodians of devices for a period of time, before they\\'re passed on to the next consumer.So instead of tossing your old device (or it living out its days in your bottom drawer), we’ll refurbish or recycle it to minimise waste and reduce the impact on the environment.\\n#### As featured in\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a7_logo%201.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a4_logo%202.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a1_logo%203.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd94598_logo%204.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd9459e_logo%205.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945aa_logo%206.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd9459b_logo%207.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a7_logo%201.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a4_logo%202.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a1_logo%203.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd94598_logo%204.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd9459e_logo%205.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945aa_logo%206.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd9459b_logo%207.png)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977b14e68f4e3552254da_singapore.jpeg)[Singapore Store](https://www.nowcircular.com/<https:/nowcircular.sg>)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977b14e68f4e3552254dd_australia.jpeg)[Australia Store](https://www.nowcircular.com/<https:/nowcircular.com.au>)\\n## Where we do it\\nCircular provides innovative and sustainable solutions to businesses and individuals in Singapore and Australia.Singapore ranks among the top countries in the Asia-Pacific region for technology adoption, with a high penetration rate of mobile devices, e-commerce, and digital payment systems.

Circular is helping people embrace a forward thinking approach where we are custodians of devices for a period of time, before they\\'re passed on to the next consumer.So instead of tossing your old device (or it living out its days in your bottom drawer), we’ll refurbish or recycle it to minimise waste and reduce the impact on the environment.\\n#### As featured in\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a7_logo%201.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a4_logo%202.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a1_logo%203.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd94598_logo%204.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd9459e_logo%205.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945aa_logo%206.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd9459b_logo%207.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a7_logo%201.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a4_logo%202.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945a1_logo%203.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd94598_logo%204.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd9459e_logo%205.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd945aa_logo%206.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977add4816cfd4fd9459b_logo%207.png)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977b14e68f4e3552254da_singapore.jpeg)Singapore Store⟨5⟩\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622e2a9ca955ec864400395e/649977b14e68f4e3552254dd_australia.jpeg)Australia Store⟨6⟩\\n## Where we do it\\nCircular provides innovative and sustainable solutions to businesses and individuals in Singapore and Australia.Singapore ranks among the top countries in the Asia-Pacific region for technology adoption, with a high penetration rate of mobile devices, e-commerce, and digital payment systems.

  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Circular**\n\n**Founding and Background**\nCircular was founded in 2021 and quickly became a part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2022 batch. Operating out of Singapore, it employs a dedicated team of 25 individuals. The company is primarily focused on revolutionizing how consumers access technology through a subscription model, making it a central player in the Asian market for consumer electronics.\n\n**Mission**\nThe mission of Circular is straightforward yet impactful: to promote the circular economy by providing convenient, affordable subscriptions for consumer electronics throughout Asia. By transitioning from ownership to rental, Circular aims to redefine our relationship with technology.\n\n**What They Offer**\nCircular has designed its services to cater to the tech-savvy consumer who wants access to the latest gadgets—think smartphones, laptops, VR equipment, and gaming gear—without the hefty price tag associated with outright purchases. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Choose**: Customers select the device they want and determine their subscription length.\n2. **Order**: After creating an account, they’ll receive confirmation of their spending power.\n3. **Delivery**: Devices are delivered for free right to the customer’s doorstep.\n4. **Options**: At the end of the subscription, users can choose to upgrade, extend, or return the device.\n\nIf a customer decides to return a device, Circular refurbishes and rents it out again, extending its lifecycle and reducing waste—a win-win for consumers and the planet.\n\n**Business Model**\nBy promoting a subscription model, Circular encourages users to experience ownership without the commitment. This approach not only aligns with sustainability but also reflects changing consumer preferences, where renting is becoming as accepted as owning.\n\n**Target Market**\nCircular primarily operates in Singapore and Australia, two regions with high technology adoption rates. By tapping into these markets, Circular caters to a tech-savvy, environmentally-conscious demographic looking for budget-friendly options.\n\n**Industry Positioning**\nCircular positions itself at the intersection of several industries, tagged under fintech, marketplace, consumer electronics, and e-commerce. This broad positioning enables it to be flexible and innovative in how it addresses consumer needs.\n\n**Team and Support**\nBacking and mentorship from seasoned partners, including Dalton Caldwell from Y Combinator, provide Circular with the resources needed to thrive and innovate in this space.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn a world where tech gadgets cycle in and out of trend at breakneck speed, Circular offers a refreshing approach—subscription over ownership. Their commitment to sustainability and customer satisfaction places them on a promising trajectory, aligned with modern consumption behaviors and environmental needs.\n\nFor more information, visit [Circular's website](https://www.nowcircular.com)."
