Given the increasingly warm climate even in the inner Bay Area, and to help decarbonize, we decided to go with a heat pump to give us central heating and cooling. We started with the Costco referral and worked with their installer. The city we live in had very stringent requirements for noise and placement, and ultimately the Costco installer was not able to meet these. We had heard of Electric Air and filled out their online form. I was surprised to be called very soon by the CEO and we talked and that led to a quote. They worked very hard through several scenarios over months with our picky city until the project was approved. They also helped us with incentives and financing. We now have very nice heat, cooling (came in very handy during the October heat wave) and an efficient, climate friendly solution. And all the folks we dealt with are super nice and friendly. Thank you, Jonathan, Matt, Jeremy, and Michael! We can\u2019t recommend Electric Air highly enough for their willingness to do what it takes to make us comfortable.\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVD_aEcOosAtwwk9UEd216KayI7VfMaLIQnPHMgap1nou0vXEOjVA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100)\\nDmitry Alexeenko\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nExceptional heat pump installation. After discussing my project with 10+ traditional contractors stuck in the 1990s, finding Electric Air was like discovering an iPhone in a sea of flip phones. Jeremy\\'s team came armed with data science, engineering precision, and a deep understanding of modern heat pump technology. They performed a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of our home, treating it like the complex system it is. Every other contractor told me I needed a dual-fuel system. Electric Air, instead, approached it like a software problem: analyze the requirements, model the solution, and execute with precision. They successfully installed a single Mitsubishi heat pump system that others claimed was \"physically impossible.\" The result is a flawlessly functioning heat pump that efficiently heats and cools our entire ~3,000 sq ft home. Electric Air combines rare technical expertise with excellent execution \u2014 they\\'re the clear choice for modern HVAC upgrades, especially if you\\'re looking to go all-electric. If other HVAC companies are running MS-DOS, Electric Air is quantum computing. They\\'re what happens when you apply Silicon Valley\\'s \"first principles thinking\" to HVAC. Simply put, they\\'re operating in a different league entirely.\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXupHOMJ6ugTVXlklb4gBGwHt_w6gzcY15_AhFR1mgfZTyd0kvZ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100)\\nLeo Romanovsky\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nLoved working with Electric Air, Jeremy the owner and the entire installation crew lead by Johntae. I purchased a house with a 30 yo gas furnace, air conditioner and ducts that were falling apart and disconnected. The system was massively oversized and costing hundreds each month to operate. The entire process was smooth and honest: I got in touch with them through their website and got a quick quote immediately. After texting about my needs, they got me a detailed one without needing to come out to the house - it was extremely competitive and after researching the modern hardware, I felt I was getting an excellent value against the legacy players who didn\\'t even offer Nest/Ecobee integration. We scheduled for a few weeks out and they got the job done in the exact timeframe expected - the installation team was extremely respectful of my house and have deep HVAC knowledge. I could tell they took pride in developing a ducting layout to meet my needs of a south-facing house with warm and cold spots. Fast forward 6 months during the summer, I had my AC running regularly and during this period saw the air handler occasionally turning itself off during the intensive use. A technician was out the next day after I called and immediately diagnosed a minor issue with the drip pan not having enough pitch to drain, causing an automatic switch to turn the unit off which prevents condensate (water) from overfilling. Very glad to have this and the issue was resolved - since then the unit has performed very well all summer, keeping the 95 degree heat down to between 70-72 where I need it. Since then contractors who have been by the house in my attic have independently remarked that the installation looks extremely professional. Highly recommend you talk to Electric Air!\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU1CbO1_BtSisMtJppmAlhDAG_yAhVw_52CNxhe8iaa5DoITCmS=s120-c-rp-mo-br100)\\nChris Habecker\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nThe installation team was great -- they worked through the old-house issues and managed to route the line neatly into the attic for the ceiling cassette.

They\u2019re good communicators using text and email to keep things moving. They have an efficient process and were quick in their responses to my many questions. We got the A-team on installation day with Roman and Daniel. They were the most courteous, respectful, neat, conscientious, installers ever, who were great at problem resolution. They were faced with a few challenges our house presented but were really thoughtful of the way they approached the process. They were communicative and explained what they were doing throughout their time at the house. The install took longer than expected not because of their doing, but because of the tight spaces in our house. It didn\u2019t matter because I felt assured they were going to get the job done right. Everyone I spoke to and met were professional and were earnest about getting the job done correctly and in a timely manner. I kinda wish I would always feel this way during any type of interaction with installers and contractors. Bottom line, I\u2019d do it again. Thanks for making us feel we made the right decision with Electric Air. From Joseph at the start who convinced us to go with EA to Roman and Daniel, and to their CEO Jeremy who actually called to check in. Thanks to all! BTW - install was completed just days before the recent heat wave. Amaze balls! Update - I just read the other reviews AFTER I wrote mine. How are these guys so consistently rated 5 stars with almost the same responses by everyone. They gotta be doing something right.\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIYdofjzOSEJyJJcZcG4BvrRqhibjpNCkf_khbByjk6eI2hXw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100)\\nJames Feichtl\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nJonathan and Michael did a great job installing the new heat pump HVAC system.

I saw the Electric Air van at our neighbor\u2019s home a few months ago and heard great things so I requested a quote and heard from Joseph within 10 minutes submitting. Joseph was a treasure trove of knowledge and came by our house to finalize the estimate later that day. Not only was our experience with Joseph a pleasure but also with the installers Roman and Daniel. They were both very friendly and courteous and took good care to install with pride, as if it were their own homes. They completed installation faster than expected and then walked me through their work throughout the house and even in the attic where the heat pump was installed. I was impressed with the craftsmanship of their work, especially where the heat pump sits as well as where it connects to the condenser outside, it really showed how much they cared to do a good job. Now our home can not only heat up in the winter time but also cool down in the summer. Additionally the condenser outside is very quiet. Not like the typical AC units you hear sitting outside of people\u2019s homes. I am so happy with the install that I immediately told my father in law who will be getting it installed next week! Thank you Daniel, Roman, and Joseph!\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWbboTBB3ozCHVrhnR6k-llgft9DhL0ouCDmaX6wMZkOgdGlMk=s120-c-rp-mo-br100)\\nJo Sh\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nThe Electric Air crew is great.

One unique thing with ElectricAir is that they came up with a model showing me the expected electricity usage of a Heat Pump based system. This is a question that traditional HVAC companies were simply unable to answer. With the rising electricity prices in CA, the projected electricity usage was a critical input in making a decision on whether to stick with a traditional gas furnace, or, swap it out for an all-electric heat pump system for heating + cooling. I compared the projected electricity usage (in KWH) with my last year\\'s winter gas bills, and that helped me get comfortable with the idea of going for a heat pump. The other things I really liked about ElectricAir: - They put in effort to right-size the HVAC system, to balance out our comfort and it\\'s long term efficiency & reliability. They do a manual-J computation to come up with this. - They were the only installer that came up with the suggestion that I can move my ductwork to the attic. This would cost a little more, but free up valuable closet space (currently taken up by the furnace). - They offer a very long labor warranty period, when the user signs up for annual service plan. This gives a lot of comfort on the long term installation health of the system. - They offer equipment from multiple vendors (including Mitsubishi), so as a consumer we can discuss the pros&cons and shortlist what to go for. It was a fantastic experience discussing and learning about HVAC systems from them. As full disclosure, I finally had to go with a different HVAC company for the install, only because I wanted a very specific unit installed at my home.

Our install was particularly challenging because it\\'s a two story house with no zoning, limited spots for placing the exterior unit and ductwork with limited accessibility. 10/10 highly recommend.\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVf8wRq_Kr9CFAyB2TkvV37LGW42rI1kb_nGhzLJfUFokWRH8-V=s36-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100)\\nMatt Ward\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nThe Electric Air team always answers my calls, emails and texts right away.

Jeremy answered my questions and I had a quote within minutes. The work was done promptly and professionally and the follow up has been excellent. I have only needed it to cool, but we have tested the heating also. If you are thinking about getting a heat pump, I strongly recommend Electric Air.\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKoHBzc5zOoUcHfVJZmwwmi2yOBXgHZwJYfuMa-k1EYHOEXvw=s36-c-rp-mo-br100)\\nRichard Abramson\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nJeremy and his team were responsive, creative and knowledgeable.

I desperately needed AC when the heat wave hit, called a bunch of companies, and got three quotes. I was not impressed with any of them and all were backed up and going to take a while to get to my job. I saw an ad for Electric Air and gave it a shot. Glad I did bc it was the easiest, most efficient process ever. I got an online quote in minutes, inquired about a site visit immediately, and they came out to my house 45 minutes later! I booked it and they started work a few days later. Less than two weeks later I had AC for the first time and my kids and pets are breathing easy. It would have taken less time, but my house had some very funky issues, which the guys addressed immediately and solved quickly. The whole team was very professional, knowledgeable, and hard working. I could not have been happier with their work. Thank you Johnathan and Roman for the great work!\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIVUzSzsZOQ2ZuK2JT8T4E05LRwEhGESTmlHWSpj8hEG3utEA=s36-c-rp-mo-br100)\\nMichael Ferem\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nVery responsive to our inquiries and questions about product costs and potential savings; quick to respond\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWKtP_jWFSSNHQqfTZVgL8jO3Xk2sois3KAly_Hxc0f2cuMixE=s36-c-rp-mo-br100)\\nIan Schmidt\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nWe had a great experience with Electric Air! We were one of their first customers, and responded to a mailing they had sent out. When I talked to Shreyas and Jeremy, I could tell that they had a lot of technical knowledge and were really passionate about heat pumps. They helped us think through the different options for our home and select a system that was a good value. The actual installation was fun to be a part of. I helped the team by running my own electrical to the equipment (I don\\'t think this is common), so I got to see a lot of the work firsthand. David, Raul and Miguel were hard workers and got the project wrapped up efficiently. There were a few things that came up during the final inspection, like ductwork that wasn\\'t strapped up. Some of this was related to existing conditions in the house before their team came through, but they were quick in sending a team to address all the issues and get us sorted. We always recommend Electric Air to friends looking for heat pumps, and in fact our next door neighbor just got a system from them as well. Most importantly our pup Max pictured below is beyond happy to now have AC!\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUlhCCn0IPSxwfBCSr8XD52PeHJfBzlNhpdd5AqPbjn5Y4f6wOULg=s36-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100)\\nVaishnavi Reddy\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nExtremely professional and I love how responsive and proactive the founders are. They even got on a video call with us and walked us through how heat pumps works. They were never pushy and always gave us enough information for us to make a decision. We just finished the installation and the technical team was extremely respectful of your space. The team is going to help us with some of the clean tax refunds as next steps and grateful to have their expertise for the next steps.\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX87uzRbDayqS0Q1FXBTnObdAVzcELTxfkeGeNWWnPeq_SME60=s36-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100)\\nSubramanian Lakshmanan\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nI was really excited to get a heat pump after a lot of research. Helios (They have recently rebranded as Electric Air) installed a heat pump for my daughter and was very impressed with the team so selected them for my home - they gave a nice referral discount. They selected a MRCOOL Universal which has been working well. It\\'s an inverter driven system which I\\'m thrilled about. The indoor is fixed speed though, so not as smart as some products out there but still an amazing improvement over my old AC. Thanks to David and Rahul for super professional and fast install on a weekend at my request. The company is owned and operated by 3 professional people Jeremy, Chris and Shreyas and all 3 of them will answer all your questions with clarity and this was an added advantage when compare to other HVAC companies ( I tried two other companies but only the sales person answered my questions in a roundabout way and was only eager to get my order) Even now, after 3 months of installation they call me and check with me how the system is working. So for we are only heating part of the heat pump and yet to test the AC part of the Heat pump. During the peak cold weather the outside temperature was 33 and my night temperature setting was 67. In the morning it took 4 to 5 hours of continuous running to reach the 71. The lesson is if the temperature is cold outside keep the inside temperature constant without changing too much between the day and night setting. I will update my review again in about 5 months after passing the peak summer temperature. Base on my wonderful experience with Helios/Electric Air I am recommending them to my friends also\\n![user profile image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIxAYJ7MuaSFvIDztN3chO_18prfwCzcX0FN1fTTHLTueK9lw=s36-c-rp-mo-br100)\\nCarl Keeney\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nShreyas and Jeremy did excellent work.

We were very impressed with Helios from start to finish. Helios selected and installed a great heat pump. Our home is an old SF victorian - in other words probably the most challenging install possible, with many tricky constraints. Despite that the team worked hard and found a solution that matched our needs, with great communication about the options throughout. Installation was efficient and smooth. Johntae and Chad were the installers, they worked hard and creatively to make sure everything worked well and looked good. We\\'re happy to now be all electric in our heating/cooling, and about a month in everything is working well. I cannot wait to now have cooling in our home in Sept/Oct when it gets hot in San Francisco. No more sleepless nights and fussy kids and grumpy me.

We wanted to add AC and get rid of gas furnace to slash a big chunk of our carbon emissions (our electricity is already 100% renewable), so heat pump was an obvious choice. Out of the few contractors we contacted, Helios was the best: - The quoting process was easy and quick. Rather than having to book a visit weeks ahead, Helios provided a quote online and booked an after visit to confirm the virtual proposal. - Helios was able to provide a great price by designing the system to utilize air handler from the existing furnace to significantly reduce the cost. They also really understood the incentives and took the extra effort to help us maximize all available incentives. - Their technical expertise was superb, and instead of confusing us with jargons, Shreyas, one of the Helios co-founders, explained the system design really clearly, answered all our questions, and helped us compare other quotes to make sure the system is right for us. - The installation technicians were efficient and detail-oriented. During the job, they found out the refrigerant line pre-wired by the home builder had a leak behind the drywall, and took an extra half-day of hard work to locate and fix it.\\n' markdown_with_citations='Helios Climate is now Electric Air!

We had a wonderful experience with them from start to finish. The entire team was knowledgable, professional and courteous. The CEO, Jeremy, was so hands on and you can tell he\\'s passionate about the mission of the company. Our gas furnace needed an emergency replacement, and Electric Air not only had the most competitive quote, they were also willing to work with me on an accelerated timeline. They dropped off portable heaters 4 days before the job started because of my situation, and I\\'m so grateful for that! Jonathan, Daniel and Matt from the installation team were top notch and I couldn\\'t be happier with the job they did. They went the extra We ended up selecting the Gree Flexx unit, and the performance of the system is great. They also set it up with my existing Nest thermostat, and it all works flawlessly. After installation, the quality of support and follow through was also unmatched. I would love to work with them again in the future if they expand their offering to include heat pump water heaters. We had a great overall experience with Electric Air, and would highly recommend them for your HVAC needs.\\n![user profile image\u27e826\u27e9]\\nJoseph E Gruber\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nElectric Air was absolutely incredible throughout the research, decision making, and installation phases. Every employee was knowledgeable about the products offered and how they would effectively replace our gas heaters. Electric Air worked quickly to schedule the installation and were even able to move up the installation to accommodate our schedule. The installers successfully placed our air fan exactly where we wanted it to preserve the look of our garden. The final product not only warms our house so much faster, effectively, and efficiently, but also the installers made it look beautiful. AND Electric Air was able to walk me through the process of receiving any tax credits or subsidies and for financing. I highly recommend Electric Air to install your heat pump!\\n![user profile image\u27e827\u27e9]\\nMichael Kaca\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nRoman, Michael; and Daniel were all amazing.

I felt very informed at every step, equipment choices to install steps. We ended up going with a single outdoor unit feeding into a branch box that supplied 2 air handlers as well as a minisplit unit in the garage. Johntae goes out of his way to ensure everything is working properly and the site is always tidy. I am incredibly happy with with performance of the system, both summer and winter. It has been about 6 months since the install, no issues at all!\\n![user profile image\u27e829\u27e9]\\nDeepak Raikar\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nEnd to end a great experience. Requesting a quote online was seamless. Joseph was awesome and super friendly coming on site to make sure everything matched up with the quote and providing all possible options in order to accommodate the uniqueness of an old home. The install team of Mike, Roman and Daniel were also incredibly knowledgeable and put in a ton of work in order to make sure everything was installed properly. I appreciate the entire team!\\n![user profile image\u27e830\u27e9]\\nJohn Arnopp\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nEarly this year we learned that our gas furnace would need to be replaced soon. Given the increasingly warm climate even in the inner Bay Area, and to help decarbonize, we decided to go with a heat pump to give us central heating and cooling. We started with the Costco referral and worked with their installer. The city we live in had very stringent requirements for noise and placement, and ultimately the Costco installer was not able to meet these. We had heard of Electric Air and filled out their online form. I was surprised to be called very soon by the CEO and we talked and that led to a quote. They worked very hard through several scenarios over months with our picky city until the project was approved. They also helped us with incentives and financing. We now have very nice heat, cooling (came in very handy during the October heat wave) and an efficient, climate friendly solution. And all the folks we dealt with are super nice and friendly. Thank you, Jonathan, Matt, Jeremy, and Michael! We can\u2019t recommend Electric Air highly enough for their willingness to do what it takes to make us comfortable.\\n![user profile image\u27e831\u27e9]\\nDmitry Alexeenko\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nExceptional heat pump installation. After discussing my project with 10+ traditional contractors stuck in the 1990s, finding Electric Air was like discovering an iPhone in a sea of flip phones. Jeremy\\'s team came armed with data science, engineering precision, and a deep understanding of modern heat pump technology. They performed a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of our home, treating it like the complex system it is. Every other contractor told me I needed a dual-fuel system. Electric Air, instead, approached it like a software problem: analyze the requirements, model the solution, and execute with precision. They successfully installed a single Mitsubishi heat pump system that others claimed was \"physically impossible.\" The result is a flawlessly functioning heat pump that efficiently heats and cools our entire ~3,000 sq ft home. Electric Air combines rare technical expertise with excellent execution \u2014 they\\'re the clear choice for modern HVAC upgrades, especially if you\\'re looking to go all-electric. If other HVAC companies are running MS-DOS, Electric Air is quantum computing. They\\'re what happens when you apply Silicon Valley\\'s \"first principles thinking\" to HVAC. Simply put, they\\'re operating in a different league entirely.\\n![user profile image\u27e832\u27e9]\\nLeo Romanovsky\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nLoved working with Electric Air, Jeremy the owner and the entire installation crew lead by Johntae. I purchased a house with a 30 yo gas furnace, air conditioner and ducts that were falling apart and disconnected. The system was massively oversized and costing hundreds each month to operate. The entire process was smooth and honest: I got in touch with them through their website and got a quick quote immediately. After texting about my needs, they got me a detailed one without needing to come out to the house - it was extremely competitive and after researching the modern hardware, I felt I was getting an excellent value against the legacy players who didn\\'t even offer Nest/Ecobee integration. We scheduled for a few weeks out and they got the job done in the exact timeframe expected - the installation team was extremely respectful of my house and have deep HVAC knowledge. I could tell they took pride in developing a ducting layout to meet my needs of a south-facing house with warm and cold spots. Fast forward 6 months during the summer, I had my AC running regularly and during this period saw the air handler occasionally turning itself off during the intensive use. A technician was out the next day after I called and immediately diagnosed a minor issue with the drip pan not having enough pitch to drain, causing an automatic switch to turn the unit off which prevents condensate (water) from overfilling. Very glad to have this and the issue was resolved - since then the unit has performed very well all summer, keeping the 95 degree heat down to between 70-72 where I need it. Since then contractors who have been by the house in my attic have independently remarked that the installation looks extremely professional. Highly recommend you talk to Electric Air!\\n![user profile image\u27e833\u27e9]\\nChris Habecker\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nThe installation team was great -- they worked through the old-house issues and managed to route the line neatly into the attic for the ceiling cassette. We worked with the designer to create a 4-zone system that is perfectly sized for our space.\\n![user profile image\u27e834\u27e9]\\nCurtis Lee\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nThe process was pretty smooth from the start. They\u2019re good communicators using text and email to keep things moving. They have an efficient process and were quick in their responses to my many questions. We got the A-team on installation day with Roman and Daniel. They were the most courteous, respectful, neat, conscientious, installers ever, who were great at problem resolution. They were faced with a few challenges our house presented but were really thoughtful of the way they approached the process. They were communicative and explained what they were doing throughout their time at the house. The install took longer than expected not because of their doing, but because of the tight spaces in our house. It didn\u2019t matter because I felt assured they were going to get the job done right. Everyone I spoke to and met were professional and were earnest about getting the job done correctly and in a timely manner. I kinda wish I would always feel this way during any type of interaction with installers and contractors. Bottom line, I\u2019d do it again. Thanks for making us feel we made the right decision with Electric Air. From Joseph at the start who convinced us to go with EA to Roman and Daniel, and to their CEO Jeremy who actually called to check in. Thanks to all! BTW - install was completed just days before the recent heat wave. Amaze balls! Update - I just read the other reviews AFTER I wrote mine. How are these guys so consistently rated 5 stars with almost the same responses by everyone. They gotta be doing something right.\\n![user profile image\u27e835\u27e9]\\nJames Feichtl\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nJonathan and Michael did a great job installing the new heat pump HVAC system.

I saw the Electric Air van at our neighbor\u2019s home a few months ago and heard great things so I requested a quote and heard from Joseph within 10 minutes submitting. Joseph was a treasure trove of knowledge and came by our house to finalize the estimate later that day. Not only was our experience with Joseph a pleasure but also with the installers Roman and Daniel. They were both very friendly and courteous and took good care to install with pride, as if it were their own homes. They completed installation faster than expected and then walked me through their work throughout the house and even in the attic where the heat pump was installed. I was impressed with the craftsmanship of their work, especially where the heat pump sits as well as where it connects to the condenser outside, it really showed how much they cared to do a good job. Now our home can not only heat up in the winter time but also cool down in the summer. Additionally the condenser outside is very quiet. Not like the typical AC units you hear sitting outside of people\u2019s homes. I am so happy with the install that I immediately told my father in law who will be getting it installed next week! Thank you Daniel, Roman, and Joseph!\\n![user profile image\u27e838\u27e9]\\nJo Sh\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nThe Electric Air crew is great. Highly competitive estimate and setup.

Would highly recommend\\n![user profile image\u27e839\u27e9]\\nAyush Jain\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nI reached out to Electric Air to get a quote on installing a new Heat pump based HVAC system + ducts. One unique thing with ElectricAir is that they came up with a model showing me the expected electricity usage of a Heat Pump based system. This is a question that traditional HVAC companies were simply unable to answer. With the rising electricity prices in CA, the projected electricity usage was a critical input in making a decision on whether to stick with a traditional gas furnace, or, swap it out for an all-electric heat pump system for heating + cooling. I compared the projected electricity usage (in KWH) with my last year\\'s winter gas bills, and that helped me get comfortable with the idea of going for a heat pump. The other things I really liked about ElectricAir: - They put in effort to right-size the HVAC system, to balance out our comfort and it\\'s long term efficiency & reliability. They do a manual-J computation to come up with this. - They were the only installer that came up with the suggestion that I can move my ductwork to the attic. This would cost a little more, but free up valuable closet space (currently taken up by the furnace). - They offer a very long labor warranty period, when the user signs up for annual service plan. This gives a lot of comfort on the long term installation health of the system. - They offer equipment from multiple vendors (including Mitsubishi), so as a consumer we can discuss the pros&cons and shortlist what to go for. It was a fantastic experience discussing and learning about HVAC systems from them. As full disclosure, I finally had to go with a different HVAC company for the install, only because I wanted a very specific unit installed at my home.

The system is working great, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s way quieter than my old furnace. Highly recommend Electric Air for any HVAC upgrades or installations! On a last note, we have owned our place for several years now and have done many upgrades/maintenance projects to our home: I can tell you the crew at Electric Air has been the most professional group of people we have ever engaged with in the construction/remodel business.

I had a heat pump and condenser installed to replace an aged, undersized and failing system. Electric Air gave me the best price, great service and moved extremely fast to get me back up and running. For the first time in 25 years the house is cool during the summer in the rooms furthest from the furnace. We also had a great installer named Javier Sandoval from JCS Mechanical. He worked hard, stayed late, did fantastic work and was really nice and professional. I loved how he explained every detail on how to use the system. Best decision ever to use Electric Air!!!\\n![user profile image\u27e850\u27e9]\\nLisa Loh\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nWe chose Electric Air over 2 other companies largely because they were attentive to our needs and seemed more interested in coming up with the best solution (even if it meant spending more time upfront) than just closing the deal. A shout out to Joseph Chen (sales engr) who worked patiently and closely with us, answering all our many questions, and Jeremy Osborne (hands-on CEO) for coming up with the hybrid configuration of Mr Cool systems - a ductless system in the front part of the house and a ducted system in the back part that can be operated independently of each other while being connected to the same external unit. They handled the applicable rebates, certification, and guided us on applying for the interest-free 5-year loan from PG&E, making the process painless. The installation crew - Roman, Johnathan and Matt - were great. They were punctual, communicative (so no bad surprises) and left our home cleaner than before they came! We are really happy with the results, especially how quiet the Mr Cool units are, and how the installation crew surmounted the challenges posed by a decades-old house with oddly-placed joists. We have already recommended Electric Air to our friends who have HVAC projects in mind.\\n![user profile image\u27e851\u27e9]\\nAnand Prasad\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nHad a fantastic experience working with Electric Air. They\\'ve consistently gone above and beyond to ensure a comfortable well balanced HVAC setup, even coming back months post install to adjust airflow upstairs working with a tiny attic crawlspace. The result: a cool upstairs during a heat wave, which seemed impossible before. Their quote was highly competitive, the team is always available to jump on a call/text and the entire crew demonstrated deep expertise. Our install was particularly challenging because it\\'s a two story house with no zoning, limited spots for placing the exterior unit and ductwork with limited accessibility. 10/10 highly recommend.\\n![user profile image\u27e852\u27e9]\\nMatt Ward\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nThe Electric Air team always answers my calls, emails and texts right away.

Jeremy answered my questions and I had a quote within minutes. The work was done promptly and professionally and the follow up has been excellent. I have only needed it to cool, but we have tested the heating also. If you are thinking about getting a heat pump, I strongly recommend Electric Air.\\n![user profile image\u27e854\u27e9]\\nRichard Abramson\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nJeremy and his team were responsive, creative and knowledgeable. They are also really nice guys with whom it is a pleasure to collaborate. Highly recommended.\\n![user profile image\u27e855\u27e9]\\nJames Peng\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nVery responsive, very professional, super friendly, high quality of work. Highly recommend\\n![user profile image\u27e856\u27e9]\\nAndrew Harper\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nGREAT experience with Electric Air. I desperately needed AC when the heat wave hit, called a bunch of companies, and got three quotes. I was not impressed with any of them and all were backed up and going to take a while to get to my job. I saw an ad for Electric Air and gave it a shot. Glad I did bc it was the easiest, most efficient process ever. I got an online quote in minutes, inquired about a site visit immediately, and they came out to my house 45 minutes later! I booked it and they started work a few days later. Less than two weeks later I had AC for the first time and my kids and pets are breathing easy. It would have taken less time, but my house had some very funky issues, which the guys addressed immediately and solved quickly. The whole team was very professional, knowledgeable, and hard working. I could not have been happier with their work. Thank you Johnathan and Roman for the great work!\\n![user profile image\u27e857\u27e9]\\nMichael Ferem\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nVery responsive to our inquiries and questions about product costs and potential savings; quick to respond\\n![user profile image\u27e858\u27e9]\\nIan Schmidt\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nWe had a great experience with Electric Air! We were one of their first customers, and responded to a mailing they had sent out. When I talked to Shreyas and Jeremy, I could tell that they had a lot of technical knowledge and were really passionate about heat pumps. They helped us think through the different options for our home and select a system that was a good value. The actual installation was fun to be a part of. I helped the team by running my own electrical to the equipment (I don\\'t think this is common), so I got to see a lot of the work firsthand. David, Raul and Miguel were hard workers and got the project wrapped up efficiently. There were a few things that came up during the final inspection, like ductwork that wasn\\'t strapped up. Some of this was related to existing conditions in the house before their team came through, but they were quick in sending a team to address all the issues and get us sorted. We always recommend Electric Air to friends looking for heat pumps, and in fact our next door neighbor just got a system from them as well. Most importantly our pup Max pictured below is beyond happy to now have AC!\\n![user profile image\u27e859\u27e9]\\nVaishnavi Reddy\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nExtremely professional and I love how responsive and proactive the founders are. They even got on a video call with us and walked us through how heat pumps works. They were never pushy and always gave us enough information for us to make a decision. We just finished the installation and the technical team was extremely respectful of your space. The team is going to help us with some of the clean tax refunds as next steps and grateful to have their expertise for the next steps.\\n![user profile image\u27e860\u27e9]\\nSubramanian Lakshmanan\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nI was really excited to get a heat pump after a lot of research. Helios (They have recently rebranded as Electric Air) installed a heat pump for my daughter and was very impressed with the team so selected them for my home - they gave a nice referral discount. They selected a MRCOOL Universal which has been working well. It\\'s an inverter driven system which I\\'m thrilled about. The indoor is fixed speed though, so not as smart as some products out there but still an amazing improvement over my old AC. Thanks to David and Rahul for super professional and fast install on a weekend at my request. The company is owned and operated by 3 professional people Jeremy, Chris and Shreyas and all 3 of them will answer all your questions with clarity and this was an added advantage when compare to other HVAC companies ( I tried two other companies but only the sales person answered my questions in a roundabout way and was only eager to get my order) Even now, after 3 months of installation they call me and check with me how the system is working. So for we are only heating part of the heat pump and yet to test the AC part of the Heat pump. During the peak cold weather the outside temperature was 33 and my night temperature setting was 67. In the morning it took 4 to 5 hours of continuous running to reach the 71. The lesson is if the temperature is cold outside keep the inside temperature constant without changing too much between the day and night setting. I will update my review again in about 5 months after passing the peak summer temperature. Base on my wonderful experience with Helios/Electric Air I am recommending them to my friends also\\n![user profile image\u27e861\u27e9]\\nCarl Keeney\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nShreyas and Jeremy did excellent work. Their team installed 10 mini-splits and have been working without for a few months now keep our new office warm all winter\\n![user profile image\u27e862\u27e9]\\nAlice Light\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nHighly recommend. We were very impressed with Helios from start to finish. Helios selected and installed a great heat pump. Our home is an old SF victorian - in other words probably the most challenging install possible, with many tricky constraints. Despite that the team worked hard and found a solution that matched our needs, with great communication about the options throughout. Installation was efficient and smooth. Johntae and Chad were the installers, they worked hard and creatively to make sure everything worked well and looked good. We\\'re happy to now be all electric in our heating/cooling, and about a month in everything is working well. I cannot wait to now have cooling in our home in Sept/Oct when it gets hot in San Francisco. No more sleepless nights and fussy kids and grumpy me. Thanks, Helios!\\n![user profile image\u27e863\u27e9]\\nGaurav Aggarwal\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nI recently had my new heat pump system installed by Helios, and I am so impressed with the quality of the work and the level of customer service I have received. The installation process was smooth and efficient. I highly recommend Helios Climate to anyone who is looking for an HVAC cobtractor. They are a top-notch company that provides excellent products and services.\\n![user profile image\u27e864\u27e9]\\nSherry Wang\\n5 out of 5\\n5 out of 5\\nWe had an excellent heat pump installation experience with Helios. We wanted to add AC and get rid of gas furnace to slash a big chunk of our carbon emissions (our electricity is already 100% renewable), so heat pump was an obvious choice. Out of the few contractors we contacted, Helios was the best: - The quoting process was easy and quick. Rather than having to book a visit weeks ahead, Helios provided a quote online and booked an after visit to confirm the virtual proposal. - Helios was able to provide a great price by designing the system to utilize air handler from the existing furnace to significantly reduce the cost. They also really understood the incentives and took the extra effort to help us maximize all available incentives. - Their technical expertise was superb, and instead of confusing us with jargons, Shreyas, one of the Helios co-founders, explained the system design really clearly, answered all our questions, and helped us compare other quotes to make sure the system is right for us. - The installation technicians were efficient and detail-oriented. During the job, they found out the refrigerant line pre-wired by the home builder had a leak behind the drywall, and took an extra half-day of hard work to locate and fix it.\\n'
