We help make booking, scheduling, taking deposits, and having conversations with your clients easy.\\nHow much does Venue cost?\\nWe don't have a monthly subscription. To cover our costs, there's a booking fee your clients pay when they book you. This makes Venue free for artists.\\nIt's free for artists — what's the catch?\\nThere's no catch! The booking fee your clients pay is 10% of your deposit. So if you have a $100 deposit, your client is charged $110, which covers Stripe's card processing fees too.Your client is clearly shown a breakdown for how much they're paying in deposits and the booking fee so there's no ambiguity how much to deduct from the final payment. However, if you prefer to take on the booking fee yourself, you can choose to have it deducted from your deposit in the Payment setting under Profile.\\nWho is Venue for?\\nVenue is for tattoo artists who manage their own booking and want to consolidate all their booking, scheduling, deposits, and client conversations in one place to make booking painless and stress-free.\\nHow do I get paid?\\nWe partner with Stripe to get you paid. When you create a Venue account, you also connect with Stripe so we can pay directly into your bank account. The first deposit payout takes up to 5 business days and the following payouts are within 1-2 business days.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675f7437c7e72aec121c0cf8_venue-drop-web.svg)\\nStart booking free\\nTattoo admin while you chill\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/67605334e7f57ebaa0d33063_time-after-time.png)\\n250k+\\nAdmin hours saved\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675f7437c7e72aec121c0cf8_venue-drop-web.svg)\\nBuilt for tattoo\\nFlexiblelike you\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/67605200c6505c83dee951cf_money-man.png)\\n90%\\nClients tip using Venue\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675b3ce2dbcaa9d787c28645_banana.png)\\nLet's befriends\\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/676056bbbb645790abc5aa65_script-instagram.svg)](https://venue.ink/<https:/www.instagram.com/venue.ink>)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/6760569666509dba734af197_script-threads.svg)](https://venue.ink/<https:/www.threads.net/@venue.ink>)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/6760566ccaae97d69511249a_script-youtube.svg)](https://venue.ink/<https:/www.youtube.com/@VenueInk>)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/676055ebfecd978f38de55be_script-pinterest.svg)](https://venue.ink/<https:/www.pinterest.com/venueink/>)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/6760547725274a647f3aee57_tattooing-hand.jpg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675f7171183c17fac56c32c3_fullwidth-hands.jpg)\\n### Free yourself from emails and DMs\\nVenue makes booking, scheduling, taking deposits, and communicating with clients easy.\\n[Try Venue rn](https://venue.ink/<http:/venue.ink/sign-up>)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675c4537256a9b374176154a_footer-phone.png)\\nLet me in\\n  * [Try Venue Now](https://venue.ink/<https:/venue.ink/sign-up>)\\n  * [Log in](https://venue.ink/<https:/venue.ink/login>)\\n\\n\\nFrom the blog\\n[Hana is Freehanding Her Future](https://venue.ink/</blog/han-ziran>)\\n[Ceci is no stranger to change](https://venue.ink/</blog/fernbabe>)\\n[Sophie is noticing the little things](https://venue.ink/</blog/meta-morphosis>)\\n[Kan is entering her second act](https://venue.ink/</blog/starstalkertattoos>)\\n[Inkbox's Inside Out Tattoo Studio Joins Venue](https://venue.ink/</blog/inkboxs-inside-out-tattoo-studio-joins-venue>)\\nMore Info\\n  * [FAQs](https://venue.ink/<http:/www.venue.ink/#faq>)\\n  * [Artists Terms of Service](https://venue.ink/<http:/www.venue.ink/owners-and-artists-terms>)\\n  * [Client Terms of Service](https://venue.ink/<http:/www.venue.ink/client-terms>)\\n\\n\\nSocials\\n  * [Instagram](https://venue.ink/<http:/www.instagram.com/venue.ink/>)\\n  * [Threads](https://venue.ink/<https:/www.threads.net/@venue.ink>)\\n  * [YouTube](https://venue.ink/<https:/www.youtube.com/@VenueInk>)\\n  * [Pinterest](https://venue.ink/<https:/www.pinterest.com/venueink/>)\\n\\n\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/65302bf5f0c360c37816a6dd_venue-logo.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675c9b4e9c1aa4e959dcb523_cherub-banner.png)\\n\" markdown_with_citations=\"![Venue home⟨1⟩](https://venue.ink/</>)\\nLogin⟨2⟩Try Venue⟨3⟩\\nMenu\\nTry⟨3⟩Login⟨4⟩Blog⟨5⟩Contact⟨6⟩\\nScroll\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675f69fdc3bc7be3162018c7_text-made-by-artists.png)\\n# Tattoo booking that’s as smooth as your lines\\nVenue is a booking app for tattoo artists that combines your customizable booking form, calendar, deposits, payments, and conversations with clients in one place.\\nTry Venue rn⟨3⟩\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675f4b55b49657a34b437e80_smooth-as-your-lines.jpg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675f7df44cd1b3aa75db80a4_text-get-your-shit-together.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675f3171bac7fb86b6e26877_banner-hiw.png)\\nWe're constantly building features to help artists save time, reduce back and forth, and get booked faster.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675c884ed74255e26c27cd43_cherub-archer.png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675c88605ec7c38e41355e18_cherub-busy.png)\\n### Upload flash\\nFlash can be uploaded in bulk or individually.

We help make booking, scheduling, taking deposits, and having conversations with your clients easy.\\nHow much does Venue cost?\\nWe don't have a monthly subscription. To cover our costs, there's a booking fee your clients pay when they book you. This makes Venue free for artists.\\nIt's free for artists — what's the catch?\\nThere's no catch! The booking fee your clients pay is 10% of your deposit. So if you have a $100 deposit, your client is charged $110, which covers Stripe's card processing fees too.Your client is clearly shown a breakdown for how much they're paying in deposits and the booking fee so there's no ambiguity how much to deduct from the final payment. However, if you prefer to take on the booking fee yourself, you can choose to have it deducted from your deposit in the Payment setting under Profile.\\nWho is Venue for?\\nVenue is for tattoo artists who manage their own booking and want to consolidate all their booking, scheduling, deposits, and client conversations in one place to make booking painless and stress-free.\\nHow do I get paid?\\nWe partner with Stripe to get you paid. When you create a Venue account, you also connect with Stripe so we can pay directly into your bank account. The first deposit payout takes up to 5 business days and the following payouts are within 1-2 business days.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ac1839b44498f07bc318a0/675f7437c7e72aec121c0cf8_venue-drop-web.svg)\\nStart booking free\\nTattoo admin while you
