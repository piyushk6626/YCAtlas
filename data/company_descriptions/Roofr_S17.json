That’s why we have dedicated Implementation Teams to help you get set up your account - including uploading materials, creating proposal templates, adding your team etc. Plus, you’re paired with an account manager that meets with you regularly to make sure you’re always getting the most out of your account.\\nDo you charge per seat?\\nNope! We know that teamwork makes the dreamwork. On (most of) our subscription plans your whole team can collaborate on one account - no additional cost. We say most of because on the Pro plan - 3 seats are included. If you’re on the Pro plan and you need more than 3 users - [let’s talk](https://roofr.com/<https:/roofr.com/talk-to-an-expert>) about upgrading you to Premium.\\nHow many seats are included with my Roofr account?\\nOur Free plan includes 2 seats, our Pro plan includes 3 seats, our Premium includes 5 seats, and our Elite plan includes a custom amount of seats.\\nFor more information on setting up your team, [talk to an expert today!](https://roofr.com/<https:/roofr.com/talk-to-an-expert>)\\nCan I register month-to-month?\\nYes, we exclusively offer monthly plans on a no-contract basis.\\nWill you help me onboard my company?\\nYes, once you register for a [**subscription plan**](https://roofr.com/</pricing>), you will have a dedicated Account Manager to help onboard your company. \\nOnboarding packages vary depending on your plan. \\n[Talk to an expert ](https://roofr.com/<https:/roofr.com/talk-to-an-expert>)to learn more. \\nCRM\\nDoes Roofr CRM have tools to generate leads?\\nWith Roofr’s Instant Estimator, you can not only generate leads - you generate QUALIFIED leads. The instant estimator replaces gathering contact information from a form, and actually provides an instant quote based on the lead’s address. It doesn’t replace a full marketing strategy, but makes it more efficient. Way more efficient.\\nCan I create custom stages in my board view?\\nYes! You can customize your job stages in the job board to match your existing workflows.\\nCan I customize the job board view of my pipeline?\\nYes, you can customize your pipeline dashboard based on job stages. Each stage is shown as column in your kanban view, and you can add or remove them at any time. If you want to play god, you can also change your pipeline view with filters. You can view the active pipeline by team member, job value, date range - you name it.\\n\\u200d\\nI want to use Roofr CRM but you’re missing a feature I love. What do I do?\\nChances are we’re already working on it! The best thing to do is book a call with one of our team. They know the product inside and out, and can help find a solution.

We know that teamwork makes the dreamwork. On (most of) our subscription plans your whole team can collaborate on one account - no additional cost. We say most of because on the Pro plan - 3 seats are included. If you’re on the Pro plan and you need more than 3 users - let’s talk⟨78⟩ about upgrading you to Premium.\\nHow many seats are included with my Roofr account?\\nOur Free plan includes 2 seats, our Pro plan includes 3 seats, our Premium includes 5 seats, and our Elite plan includes a custom amount of seats.\\nFor more information on setting up your team, talk to an expert today!⟨78⟩\\nCan I register month-to-month?\\nYes, we exclusively offer monthly plans on a no-contract basis.\\nWill you help me onboard my company?\\nYes, once you register for a **subscription plan**⟨30⟩, you will have a dedicated Account Manager to help onboard your company. \\nOnboarding packages vary depending on your plan. \\nTalk to an expert ⟨78⟩to learn more. \\nCRM\\nDoes Roofr CRM have tools to generate leads?\\nWith Roofr’s Instant Estimator, you can not only generate leads - you generate QUALIFIED leads. The instant estimator replaces gathering contact information from a form, and actually provides an instant quote based on the lead’s address. It doesn’t replace a full marketing strategy, but makes it more efficient. Way more efficient.\\nCan I create custom stages in my board view?\\nYes! You can customize your job stages in the job board to match your existing workflows.\\nCan I customize the job board view of my pipeline?\\nYes, you can customize your pipeline dashboard based on job stages. Each stage is shown as column in your kanban view, and you can add or remove them at any time. If you want to play god, you can also change your pipeline view with filters. You can view the active pipeline by team member, job value, date range - you name it.\\n\\u200d\\nI want to use Roofr CRM but you’re missing a feature I love. What do I do?\\nChances are we’re already working on it! The best thing to do is book a call with one of our team. They know the product inside and out, and can help find a solution.
