It‚Äôs a pragmatic product to solve a real, relatable problem. The approach is grounded and the UX is intuitive. The thesis that ‚Äúprompting is the new programming‚Äù feels like it will ring truer and truer as we shift towards an AI-driven economy. May we never lose prompts in Slack threads ever again!!\\n![person photo](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e01bcf271f49df875d1c31/66e3fa30c15fda766960ffc1_Matt.webp)\\nMatt Huang\\nCo-founder & CPO, Cofactory\\nI prefer Wordware strongly over writing prompt chains for LLMs in code. It's incredibly easy to use, debugging is a breeze, and iterations are 10x faster than writing Python. You write prompts in plain English anyway, so why not the entire prompt chain? Seems silly to work another way once you've experienced this.\\n![person photo](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e01bcf271f49df875d1c31/66e0295b124370d89e52e9e4_Avatar%20Image-2.webp)\\nAditya Advani\\nFounder at Eldo\\nYour product is a game-changer for English majors.

More ‚ÄòGoogle docs for prompts‚Äô where both can collaborate and work with LLMs at the same time.

Here‚Äôs what our users have to say about their experience with our product.\\nWordware is one of the most exciting products I‚Äôve seen in a long time. An IDE for prompt engineering. If you‚Äôve tried to do this in code, you know how painful it is.\\n![person photo‚ü®26‚ü©]\\nElias Str√•vik\\nFounder, Guineapig\\nWordware actually feels very powerful. I felt the same magic today, the magic I experienced when I used Replit for the first time.\\n![person photo‚ü®27‚ü©]\\nIshan Goswami\\nCo-founder, Edden\\nWow, I wish I could Angel invest in you. If you can do these two things, then we‚Äôd plug you in and then we‚Äôll be cooking with gas\\n![person photo‚ü®28‚ü©]\\nMiles Wiesenthal\\nFounding Engineer, Cofactory\\nI really really love Wordware, you‚Äôre the first vendor we‚Äôve seen that we think is just going in the right direction. It‚Äôs a pragmatic product to solve a real, relatable problem. The approach is grounded and the UX is intuitive. The thesis that ‚Äúprompting is the new programming‚Äù feels like it will ring truer and truer as we shift towards an AI-driven economy. May we never lose prompts in Slack threads ever again!!\\n![person photo‚ü®29‚ü©]\\nMatt Huang\\nCo-founder & CPO, Cofactory\\nI prefer Wordware strongly over writing prompt chains for LLMs in code. It's incredibly easy to use, debugging is a breeze, and iterations are 10x faster than writing Python. You write prompts in plain English anyway, so why not the entire prompt chain? Seems silly to work another way once you've experienced this.\\n![person photo‚ü®30‚ü©]\\nAditya Advani\\nFounder at Eldo\\nYour product is a game-changer for English majors. Their time has finally come.\\n![person photo‚ü®31‚ü©]\\nAnushe Sheikh\\nResponsible AI & ML Product Manager\\nSlight learning curve, but absurd how much I was able to chain in an hour\\n![person photo‚ü®32‚ü©]\\nNikunj Kothari\\nVenture Partner\\nDUDEEEEEE what a fucking thing of beauty like holy shit. It‚Äôs one of the BEST tools I‚Äôve used\\n![person photo‚ü®33‚ü©]\\nRafeh Qazi\\nFounder and CEO, Clever Programmer\\nNo more endless slack messages with suggested prompt edits to try to refine the result. More ‚ÄòGoogle docs for prompts‚Äô where both can collaborate and work with LLMs at the same time. But most importantly it allows you to slide the controls from low/no code to allow you to interrupt with coding options.
