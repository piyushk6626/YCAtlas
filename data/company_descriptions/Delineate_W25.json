  "generated_description": "**Company Summary: Delineate**\n\nFounded in 2024 and hailing from Y Combinator's W25 batch, Delineate is on a mission to revolutionize how biopharma research is conducted by extracting meaningful data from research literature and patents. The founders, Emily, with her MIT PhD and extensive experience at Pfizer and AstraZeneca, and Jawad, a former AI lead at Lockheed Skunkworks, bring a powerful blend of computational expertise to the table.\n\nThe crux of Delineate's innovation lies in tackling a significant challenge in the pharmaceutical industry: 90% of drug candidates fail, usually after staggering investments in R&D. By harnessing advanced large language models (LLMs) and computer vision, Delineate processes an astonishing 15 times more studies than the current industry standard. This means transforming months of painstaking research into mere weeks—a game-changer for pharmaceutical companies aiming to make evidence-based development decisions.\n\nLocated in Boston and comprising a tight-knit team of 20, Delineate has already proven its worth by securing $160K in revenue from data contracts with major players like Sanofi and Roche. They’re conducting some of the largest aggregated research studies seen to date, effectively changing the landscape of biopharma research.\n\nWith tags highlighting their focus areas—artificial intelligence, SaaS, biotech, and Boston—their platform positions itself at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and life sciences. Led by Jared Friedman from Y Combinator, Delineate is not just extracting data; it’s redefining how that data translates into actionable insights for the future of drug development.\n\nFor more information, check out [Delineate’s website](https://delineate.pro/)."
