  "description": "Lingo.dev (formerly Replexica) automates the localization process end-to-end. It produces authentic translations instantly and eliminates translation management and manual work. Our AI generates pull requests with translations when developers commit UI code changes, avoiding the typical back-and-forth with translation agencies. This helps teams do localization 100x faster, ship to production more often, without bottlenecks.",

  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Lingo.dev**  \nFounded in 2024 and based in San Francisco, Lingo.dev (formerly Replexica) is at the forefront of automating localization for development teams. With a nimble team of three and backed by Y Combinator's Batch F24, Lingo.dev is positioned to revolutionize how developers handle translations.\n\n**Mission**  \nLingo.dev's mission is straightforward: they aim to automate the localization process end-to-end.
