  "description": "Law practice is intellectual work trapped in a mesh of administrative tasks. We’re building AI agents that automate pre-litigation workflows for personal injury law firms. \r\n\nFrom AI voice agents that take the initial client intake call to drafting discovery requests and analyzing responses for motions to compel, new workflows can now be automated with the advent of voice and reasoning models.\r\n\nPersonal injury is a $57 billion market in the U.S. alone, with a contingency fee billing model that incentivizes efficiency (unlike other practices of law billed hourly). In high-quality firms, each attorney can make upwards of 3.5 million per year– saving even 1% of their time is significant. We're working on saving >30% of their time. \r\n\nThe founders, Jesse and Isabelle, met at Georgia Tech, where they graduated with degrees in Computer Science. They’ve worked on projects together for 4 years, while gaining industry experience as software engineers at LinkedIn, Intuit, Notion, and Figma.",

  "generated_description": "### Cedar: Revolutionizing Personal Injury Law with AI\n\n**Mission & Vision**\nCedar, founded in 2025 and currently participating in Y Combinator's W25 batch, is on a mission to automate the often tedious and administrative aspects of personal injury law. The founders—Jesse Li and Isabelle Ilyia—met at Georgia Tech, where they honed their skills in software engineering. They realized that in the highly competitive $57 billion personal injury market, freeing attorneys from administrative shackles could drastically enhance efficiency and client care.\n\n**How It Works**\nCedar develops AI agents that can handle a broad array of pre-litigation workflows. From conducting initial client intake calls to drafting discovery requests and evaluating responses for motions to compel, Cedar's AI is designed to streamline tasks that traditionally consume significant attorney time. Their technology promises impressive time savings—over 30%—which is particularly significant in a field where attorneys can earn upwards of $3.5 million per year in high-quality firms.\n\n**Key Features**\n- **24/7 Client Intake:** A trained AI agent is available around the clock, offering a patient and empathetic first contact for potential clients. \n- **Instant Discovery Analysis:** Cedar helps quickly identify missing documents and maintain compliance, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.\n- **Automated Medical Record Review:** Deep dives into extensive medical records become manageable, as Cedar extracts the critical details that matter most for case strategy.\n\nCedar prioritizes user privacy, employing end-to-end encryption and HIPAA compliance to ensure that law firms can trust their data is secure.\n\n**The Team**\nThe company is lean, with a team of just two employees, but boasts a wealth of experience from previous roles at prominent tech firms like LinkedIn, Intuit, Notion, and Figma. Jesse serves as CEO, leveraging his experience in software optimization, while Isabelle, as CTO, capitalizes on her expertise in messaging features for sales conversion. Together, they're built to navigate the intersection of AI and legal tech effectively.\n\n**Backers & Future Aspirations**\nCedar has caught the attention of top investors, including Y Combinator and OpenAI. The duo is eager to partner with law firms that are ready to embrace tech for better outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, Cedar stands at the forefront of a promising change in personal injury law, blending cutting-edge AI technology with essential legal workflows. If you're in the legal space and looking to gain an edge, Cedar is worth exploring.
