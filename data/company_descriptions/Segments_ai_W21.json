You can upload point clouds of unlimited size, then label them with smart interfaces and tools such as the merged 3D mode, the batch mode, and automated tracking.\\nThe best part? You can use that 3D data to enrich your 2D labeling efforts. Instead of drawing hundreds of bounding boxes, all you need is a single cuboid in a 3D point cloud. Then, you can project that cuboid to all the images where the object appears and voilÃ  â youâve just saved your team precious time and effort.\\n  * ### [Quickly label moving objects](https://segments.ai/<#tab-9a6003f59797d5ae7ce>)\\n  * ### [Effortlessly label stationary objects](https://segments.ai/<#tab-70999b73f56f0ecedd4>)\\n\\n\\n  * ### [Quickly label moving objects](https://segments.ai/<#tab-9a6003f59797d5ae7ce>)\\n\\n\\nSkip the back and forth between frames while making minor cuboid adjustments. Segments.ai lets you see all instances of an object through a sequence in a user-friendly, scrollable view. When you adjust a cuboid in one instance, itâll update its position, dimensions, and rotations across frames. \\nIf you want to take it a step further, you can use machine learning for auto-annotations of moving objects. Youâll speed up the process, but still retain complete manual oversight.\\n  * Real-time interpolation\\n  * ML-powered object tracking\\n  * Simple object overview to find inaccuracies quickly\\n\\n\\n[See all smart point cloud tools](https://segments.ai/<https:/segments.ai/data-labeling/3d-point-cloud/>)\\n![](https://segments.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/top-only-browser-image-min.png)\\nSorry, your browser doesn\\'t support embedded videos.\\n![ML-assisted data labeling with batch mode smart cuboid propagation](https://segments.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ML-assisted-data-labeling-with-batch-mode-smart-cuboid-propagation.png)\\n  * ### [Effortlessly label stationary objects](https://segments.ai/<#tab-70999b73f56f0ecedd4>)\\n\\n\\nNeed to label static objects with only a few points in each frame, but struggling to see the actual dimensions? \\nSegments.ai lets you unify all the frames in a sequence into a single merged point cloud.

And, the backend technology makes sure the UX stays fast and responsive.\\nLabel dynamic objects with Batch Mode[Tom Staelens](https://segments.ai/<https:/segments.ai/blog/author/tomatillos/> \"Posts by Tom Staelens\")2023-11-06T10:53:15+01:00\\n### [Label dynamic objects with Batch Mode](https://segments.ai/<#collapse-1-2070>)\\nBatch Mode lets you view all instances of an object in a sequence on a single, scrollable screen. Correcting labels is as easy as modifying the cuboid in one row, then watching the changes be applied in all other frames.\\nLabel stationary objects with Merged Point Cloud[Tom Staelens](https://segments.ai/<https:/segments.ai/blog/author/tomatillos/> \"Posts by Tom Staelens\")2023-11-06T10:53:21+01:00\\n### [Label stationary objects with Merged Point Cloud](https://segments.ai/<#collapse-1-2072>)\\nMake it easy to label stationary objects that only have a few points in each frame. Merged Point Cloud mode combines all the frames in a sequence into one large point cloud. By consolidating the points across frames, object outlines become more visible â allowing for precise annotation with a tight-fitting cuboid in a single go.\\nPropagate cuboids across sequences with machine learning[Tom Staelens](https://segments.ai/<https:/segments.ai/blog/author/tomatillos/> \"Posts by Tom Staelens\")2023-11-06T10:53:28+01:00\\n### [Propagate cuboids across sequences with machine learning](https://segments.ai/<#collapse-1-2074>)\\nSpeed up the process of 3D bounding box labeling with keyframe interpolation in the Batch Mode interface. On the Scale and Enterprise plans, you can also take advantage of the automated tracking feature.\\nAutomated cuboid propagation lets you label a moving object once, then automatically track it across frames by hitting the âplayâ button. If you notice any deviations from the path, simply hit pause, make the necessary corrections, and then continue again.\\nRotate a cuboid along all 3 axes[Tom Staelens](https://segments.ai/<https:/segments.ai/blog/author/tomatillos/> \"Posts by Tom Staelens\")2023-11-06T10:53:32+01:00\\n### [Rotate a cuboid along all 3 axes](https://segments.ai/<#collapse-1-2076>)\\nIn the point cloud interface for cuboids, you have the option to enable full 3D rotation by adjusting the dataset settings. By rotating on three axes, youâll get better control of its orientation for more precise, accurate, and efficient labeling.\\n[Discover 3D labeling](https://segments.ai/<https:/segments.ai/data-labeling/3d-point-cloud/>)\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%2732%27%20height%3D%2724%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%2032%2024%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%2732%27%20height%3D%2724%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)\\nLabeling on Segments.ai is so quick and simple.

This proved very useful at giving labelers context for what they were looking at in 3D, especially in noisy shots.\\n![](https://segments.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sarina-Hao-Robotics-Engineer.webp)\\nSarina H.\\nRobotics Software Engineer OCIUS Technology Limited\\n![](https://segments.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ocius-robotics-testimonial.jpeg)\\n## Label 3D point clouds efficiently\\nAnnotate objects in 3D in just a few clicks. You can upload point clouds of unlimited size, then label them with smart interfaces and tools such as the merged 3D mode, the batch mode, and automated tracking.\\nThe best part? You can use that 3D data to enrich your 2D labeling efforts. Instead of drawing hundreds of bounding boxes, all you need is a single cuboid in a 3D point cloud. Then, you can project that cuboid to all the images where the object appears and voilÃ  â youâve just saved your team precious time and effort.\\n  * ### Quickly label moving objectsâ¨44â©\\n  * ### Effortlessly label stationary objectsâ¨45â©\\n\\n\\n  * ### Quickly label moving objectsâ¨44â©\\n\\n\\nSkip the back and forth between frames while making minor cuboid adjustments. Segments.ai lets you see all instances of an object through a sequence in a user-friendly, scrollable view. When you adjust a cuboid in one instance, itâll update its position, dimensions, and rotations across frames. \\nIf you want to take it a step further, you can use machine learning for auto-annotations of moving objects. Youâll speed up the process, but still retain complete manual oversight.\\n  * Real-time interpolation\\n  * ML-powered object tracking\\n  * Simple object overview to find inaccuracies quickly\\n\\n\\nSee all smart point cloud toolsâ¨12â©\\n![](https://segments.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/top-only-browser-image-min.png)\\nSorry, your browser doesn\\'t support embedded videos.\\n![ML-assisted data labeling with batch mode smart cuboid propagationâ¨46â©]\\n  * ### Effortlessly label stationary objectsâ¨45â©\\n\\n\\nNeed to label static objects with only a few points in each frame, but struggling to see the actual dimensions? \\nSegments.ai lets you unify all the frames in a sequence into a single merged point cloud. Outlines will be more visible, so the object can be annotated with a tight-fitting cuboid on the first attempt.\\n  * Enrich an object of only a few points with a single click\\n  * Get crystal clear object outlines\\n  * Label cuboids accurately on the first try\\n\\n\\nStart labeling more accuratelyâ¨12â©\\n![](https://segments.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/top-only-browser-image-min.png)\\n![Data labeling in a point cloud with merged point cloud - beforeâ¨47â©]![Data labeling in a 3d point cloud with merged point cloud enabledâ¨47â©]\\nAll features of point cloud labelingâ¨12â©\\n## Get from PoC to production, faster\\nAccurate labels.

Our 3D Point Cloud interface splits point clouds into 3D tiles for faster loading times and a reduced GPU workload (similar to Google Mapâs use of low to high-resolution images). And, the backend technology makes sure the UX stays fast and responsive.\\nLabel dynamic objects with Batch ModeTom Staelensâ¨37â©2023-11-06T10:53:15+01:00\\n### Label dynamic objects with Batch Modeâ¨49â©\\nBatch Mode lets you view all instances of an object in a sequence on a single, scrollable screen. Correcting labels is as easy as modifying the cuboid in one row, then watching the changes be applied in all other frames.\\nLabel stationary objects with Merged Point CloudTom Staelensâ¨37â©2023-11-06T10:53:21+01:00\\n### Label stationary objects with Merged Point Cloudâ¨50â©\\nMake it easy to label stationary objects that only have a few points in each frame. Merged Point Cloud mode combines all the frames in a sequence into one large point cloud. By consolidating the points across frames, object outlines become more visible â allowing for precise annotation with a tight-fitting cuboid in a single go.\\nPropagate cuboids across sequences with machine learningTom Staelensâ¨37â©2023-11-06T10:53:28+01:00\\n### Propagate cuboids across sequences with machine learningâ¨51â©\\nSpeed up the process of 3D bounding box labeling with keyframe interpolation in the Batch Mode interface. On the Scale and Enterprise plans, you can also take advantage of the automated tracking feature.\\nAutomated cuboid propagation lets you label a moving object once, then automatically track it across frames by hitting the âplayâ button. If you notice any deviations from the path, simply hit pause, make the necessary corrections, and then continue again.\\nRotate a cuboid along all 3 axesTom Staelensâ¨37â©2023-11-06T10:53:32+01:00\\n### Rotate a cuboid along all 3 axesâ¨52â©\\nIn the point cloud interface for cuboids, you have the option to enable full 3D rotation by adjusting the dataset settings. By rotating on three axes, youâll get better control of its orientation for more precise, accurate, and efficient labeling.\\nDiscover 3D labelingâ¨12â©\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%2732%27%20height%3D%2724%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%2032%2024%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%2732%27%20height%3D%2724%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)\\nLabeling on Segments.ai is so quick and simple.
