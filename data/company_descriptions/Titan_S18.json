But for those who want to have their money managed, they must turn to high fee, high minimum advisors (e.g., RIAs like Edward Jones). With LLMs, we can now offer personalized wealth management to many more people, more cheaply and with faster service. Our goal is to grow their wealth more than they'd do on their own.",

With robo-advisors, you get a cookie-cutter ETF portfolio that never changes. Neither is ideal if you are serious about trying to grow your wealth.\\nWe\u2019re building what comes next. Titan actively manages your money with a team of real investment professionals at your disposal, all focused on one goal: making you more money while saving you more time. Plus, you get premium benefits you\u2019ll actually use, like free tax filing and direct access to our investment team.\\nWhy shouldn\u2019t I just use the S&P 500?\\nWe\u2019re big fans of the S&P 500. It\u2019s a well-rounded index of equities that has historically performed very well over a long period of time relative to other investment options. But it shouldn\u2019t be 100% of most people\u2019s portfolios at all times. Wealth should be personalized.\\nWe take your personal situation into account and build you a portfolio that goes beyond just large US stocks. We mix passive and active strategies across different asset classes, and we\u2019re tactical about when and how to invest \u2013 especially important when the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs.\\nBottom line: The S&P 500 is a great tool, but it\u2019s just one tool. Your wealth needs a full toolbox, and that\u2019s what we provide.\\nHow is Titan choosing investment options for me?\\nWe get it \u2013 finance is full of jargon, endless options, and a lot of noise. Our approach is different. We\u2019re incredibly picky about what makes it into your portfolio because our mission is simple: growing your wealth as efficiently as possible.\\nWe maintain a small but powerful suite of investment tools, carefully chosen by our investment team. No bloated menus of random options \u2013 just high-quality investment options at the lowest possible prices. Think of us as your investment filter, cutting through the Wall Street noise to identify what actually works.\\nOur analysts conduct deep research on every investment we offer, asking one simple question: How can this help grow your hard-earned money quicker and more efficiently? That\u2019s it.\\nHow often should I expect to chat with an advisor?\\nThink of us as your personal advisor team that\u2019s always just a tap away. You\u2019re in control of how much support you want. Major life changes on the horizon? Let\u2019s talk them through. Just want a quick portfolio review? We can do that too.\\nSome of our clients love having quarterly check-ins to stay on top of their financial goals and make sure everything\u2019s tracking right. Others might only reach out once or twice a year when they\u2019re facing big life decisions or want to revisit their strategy. Both approaches are perfectly fine \u2013 we\u2019re here when you need us.\\nHow much does Titan membership cost?\\nOur membership is straightforward: $25/month (or $250/year if you choose annual billing). This isn\u2019t just another fee \u2013 it\u2019s your investment in having a team of professionals actively manage your wealth.\\nTitan clients have historically compounded their wealth at 11.6% per year on average. Studies show that the average DIY investor underperforms advisors and the broader market by ~3% per year. (Disclosure)\\nFor our average client making $75/hour, we save them over $10,000 worth of time annually \u2013 time they\u2019d otherwise spend managing their own portfolio (most DIY investors spend 3-5 hours weekly on this).\\nPlus, we\u2019re about 50% cheaper than traditional private wealth managers. If you\u2019ve invested at least $6,000 in our Smart Treasury product, the earnings from our industry-leading yield can offset your membership fee. Bottom line: if we save you just 20 minutes a month (which we consistently do), the fee has already paid for itself.\\nMore info on pricing [here](http://www.titan.com/<https:/help.titan.com/en_us/titan-s-fees-B1lNrytB9>).\\nHow do I know Titan is the right wealth manager for me?\\nSimple: If you\u2019ve graduated from DIY trading apps and want your wealth managed by professionals who actually explain what they\u2019re doing, we\u2019re your team. We\u2019re built for people who value their time and want their money working harder for them.\\nThink of us as your personal chief financial officer, right in your pocket. We take the complex world of wealth management and make it straightforward, active, and tailored to you. No more juggling multiple apps or trying to piece together your own investment strategy \u2013 we handle everything in one place, with one clear goal: make you more money while saving you more time.\\nWhy do Titan clients choose us?\\nWe\u2019re not your typical wealth manager. We\u2019re building what we wanted but couldn\u2019t find \u2013 a wealth manager that combines institutional-grade investing with modern technology and real human expertise, but without the high fees and minimums usually required by other firms. You get our proprietary investment strategies (like our Flagship equity portfolio), smart cash management solutions, and on-demand access to real financial advisors who know their stuff.\\nBut it\u2019s more than just managing money. We\u2019re giving you back your time and peace of mind, plus adding perks you\u2019ll actually use \u2013 like free tax filing and access to investment opportunities typically reserved for the ultra-wealthy. We\u2019re not just managing your wealth; we\u2019re helping you build and enjoy it.\\nHow secure is my money with Titan?\\nLet us be crystal clear about this: Your security is our absolute priority. As an SEC-registered investment adviser, Titan is legally required to act in your best interest as a fiduciary.\\nSIPC protects investors against the loss of [cash and securities](http://www.titan.com/<https:/www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects#cash>) in the event of a SIPC-member brokerage firm failure. The limit of SIPC coverage is $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash. SIPC coverage is limited and does not protect against the decline in value of your securities. For more details, visit [www.sipc.org.](http://www.titan.com/<https:/www.sipc.org/>)\\nPlus, we use a third-party custodian to hold client assets separately. Most importantly, you own all your underlying assets in a separately managed account - we don\\'t hold your assets directly. We employ industry-leading encryption and cybersecurity measures to protect your data, from encryption to SAML protection, because we know we\\'re handling your hard-earned money.

The recommendations were collected via an independent survey sent to over 20,000 individuals. While clients were able to evaluate and recommend their RIA firm, financial advisors working for an RIA firm were asked to consider a scenario where their own firm could not take on a client and had to recommend another RIA firm they appreciate. The development of AUM was analyzed both, short and long term based on publicly available data. For the short term view, the growth of AUM over a twelve months period was calculated, from January 2022 to January 2023. For the long term view, the growth of AUM over a five year period was calculated, from 2018 to 2023. In the consideration for the top 500 RIA firms, recommendations had a weight of 20% while development of AUM had a weight of 80% (short term and long term growth were equally weighted) to derive the final score.\\nTop Private Y Combinator Companies, Y Combinator (2023): Inclusion in the 2023 \\'Top Private Y Combinator Companies\\' list is based on the company\\'s valuation from its latest funding round, and all companies on the list are valued at over $150M.\\nTitan participated in the Y Combinator funding cycle in 2018. Y Combinator runs two three-month funding cycles a year, during which selected entrepreneurial teams are given a seed investment in exchange for a small equity stake in the company. The teams move to Silicon Valley for the duration of the cycle, during which they receive intensive mentoring and assistance in refining their business plans, developing their products, and pitching to investors. The cycle culminates in a Demo Day, during which each startup presents a quick pitch to a carefully selected, invite-only audience of investors.\\nBest Wealth Management Solution, Finovate (2022): The \\'Best Wealth Management Solution\\' award is given to a wealth management firm, bank or FI with an excellent new solution to give consumers more control over their future wealth and help them meet long-term financial goals.\\nFastest Growing Retail Investment Brand, Global Brands Magazine (2021): Titan\\'s recognition as the 2021 Fastest Growing Retail Investment Brand by Global Brands Magazine is based on an evaluation process involving a nominations team, an internal research team, and an independent external research agency. Companies are proactively invited to participate, and all nominations are validated and researched for adequate data. The external research agency then scrutinizes the nominations based on various criteria and publicly available data. Final award winners are decided by the internal team based on fundamental objectives and announced on the Global Brands Magazine website.\\nThese recognitions do not evaluate client satisfaction or predict future investment performance.

This includes all strategies and third-party funds added over time, with performance figures accounting for the reinvestment of dividends and net of advisory and membership fees (where applicable). The 5-year annualized return is 12.38% (1/01/2020 \u2013 12/31/2024), and the 1-year cumulative return is 21.1% (1/01/2024 \u2013 12/31/2024). Past performance is not indicative of future results. All investments carry risk, including the potential loss of principal, and investment growth is not guaranteed. Vanguard attributes the ~3% added by financial advisors primarily to strategic planning and behavioral coaching. Additionally, [DALBAR\\'s annual Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior report](http://www.titan.com/<https:/atlasfinancialinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DALBAR-2023-QAIB.pdf>) indicates that, over a 30-year period ending December 31, 2022, self-directed investors often underperform by ~3% annually due to behavioral biases and poor decision-making.\\nIn addition to the annual advisory fee, a Membership Fee of $25 per month (or $250 annually if paid in advance) applies. This fee covers platform access, investment offerings, tools, and services included in your wealth management experience.\\nDisclosure: Titan\u2019s performance figure represents the annualized return since 2/20/2018, when Titan launched, and is a composite of the median aggregate performance of all client accounts and portfolio allocations as of 12/9/2024.

With robo-advisors, you get a cookie-cutter ETF portfolio that never changes. Neither is ideal if you are serious about trying to grow your wealth.\\nWe\u2019re building what comes next. Titan actively manages your money with a team of real investment professionals at your disposal, all focused on one goal: making you more money while saving you more time. Plus, you get premium benefits you\u2019ll actually use, like free tax filing and direct access to our investment team.\\nWhy shouldn\u2019t I just use the S&P 500?\\nWe\u2019re big fans of the S&P 500. It\u2019s a well-rounded index of equities that has historically performed very well over a long period of time relative to other investment options. But it shouldn\u2019t be 100% of most people\u2019s portfolios at all times. Wealth should be personalized.\\nWe take your personal situation into account and build you a portfolio that goes beyond just large US stocks. We mix passive and active strategies across different asset classes, and we\u2019re tactical about when and how to invest \u2013 especially important when the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs.\\nBottom line: The S&P 500 is a great tool, but it\u2019s just one tool. Your wealth needs a full toolbox, and that\u2019s what we provide.\\nHow is Titan choosing investment options for me?\\nWe get it \u2013 finance is full of jargon, endless options, and a lot of noise. Our approach is different. We\u2019re incredibly picky about what makes it into your portfolio because our mission is simple: growing your wealth as efficiently as possible.\\nWe maintain a small but powerful suite of investment tools, carefully chosen by our investment team. No bloated menus of random options \u2013 just high-quality investment options at the lowest possible prices. Think of us as your investment filter, cutting through the Wall Street noise to identify what actually works.\\nOur analysts conduct deep research on every investment we offer, asking one simple question: How can this help grow your hard-earned money quicker and more efficiently? That\u2019s it.\\nHow often should I expect to chat with an advisor?\\nThink of us as your personal advisor team that\u2019s always just a tap away. You\u2019re in control of how much support you want. Major life changes on the horizon? Let\u2019s talk them through. Just want a quick portfolio review? We can do that too.\\nSome of our clients love having quarterly check-ins to stay on top of their financial goals and make sure everything\u2019s tracking right. Others might only reach out once or twice a year when they\u2019re facing big life decisions or want to revisit their strategy. Both approaches are perfectly fine \u2013 we\u2019re here when you need us.\\nHow much does Titan membership cost?\\nOur membership is straightforward: $25/month (or $250/year if you choose annual billing). This isn\u2019t just another fee \u2013 it\u2019s your investment in having a team of professionals actively manage your wealth.\\nTitan clients have historically compounded their wealth at 11.6% per year on average. Studies show that the average DIY investor underperforms advisors and the broader market by ~3% per year. (Disclosure)\\nFor our average client making $75/hour, we save them over $10,000 worth of time annually \u2013 time they\u2019d otherwise spend managing their own portfolio (most DIY investors spend 3-5 hours weekly on this).\\nPlus, we\u2019re about 50% cheaper than traditional private wealth managers. If you\u2019ve invested at least $6,000 in our Smart Treasury product, the earnings from our industry-leading yield can offset your membership fee. Bottom line: if we save you just 20 minutes a month (which we consistently do), the fee has already paid for itself.\\nMore info on pricing here\u27e816\u27e9.\\nHow do I know Titan is the right wealth manager for me?\\nSimple: If you\u2019ve graduated from DIY trading apps and want your wealth managed by professionals who actually explain what they\u2019re doing, we\u2019re your team. We\u2019re built for people who value their time and want their money working harder for them.\\nThink of us as your personal chief financial officer, right in your pocket. We take the complex world of wealth management and make it straightforward, active, and tailored to you. No more juggling multiple apps or trying to piece together your own investment strategy \u2013 we handle everything in one place, with one clear goal: make you more money while saving you more time.\\nWhy do Titan clients choose us?\\nWe\u2019re not your typical wealth manager. We\u2019re building what we wanted but couldn\u2019t find \u2013 a wealth manager that combines institutional-grade investing with modern technology and real human expertise, but without the high fees and minimums usually required by other firms. You get our proprietary investment strategies (like our Flagship equity portfolio), smart cash management solutions, and on-demand access to real financial advisors who know their stuff.\\nBut it\u2019s more than just managing money. We\u2019re giving you back your time and peace of mind, plus adding perks you\u2019ll actually use \u2013 like free tax filing and access to investment opportunities typically reserved for the ultra-wealthy. We\u2019re not just managing your wealth; we\u2019re helping you build and enjoy it.\\nHow secure is my money with Titan?\\nLet us be crystal clear about this: Your security is our absolute priority. As an SEC-registered investment adviser, Titan is legally required to act in your best interest as a fiduciary.\\nSIPC protects investors against the loss of cash and securities\u27e817\u27e9 in the event of a SIPC-member brokerage firm failure. The limit of SIPC coverage is $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash. SIPC coverage is limited and does not protect against the decline in value of your securities. For more details, visit www.sipc.org.\u27e818\u27e9\\nPlus, we use a third-party custodian to hold client assets separately. Most importantly, you own all your underlying assets in a separately managed account - we don\\'t hold your assets directly. We employ industry-leading encryption and cybersecurity measures to protect your data, from encryption to SAML protection, because we know we\\'re handling your hard-earned money. That\\'s a responsibility we take incredibly seriously.\\nProduct\\nSmart Treasury\u27e819\u27e9Wealth\u27e81\u27e9Performance\u27e820\u27e9Log in\u27e821\u27e9\\nTitan\\nTestimonials\u27e82\u27e9About\u27e83\u27e9Careers\u27e822\u27e9\\nMore\\nLegal\u27e823\u27e9Privacy\u27e824\u27e9Terms\u27e825\u27e9Help\u27e826\u27e9\\n\u00a9 2025 Titan Global Capital Management USA LLC.

The recommendations were collected via an independent survey sent to over 20,000 individuals. While clients were able to evaluate and recommend their RIA firm, financial advisors working for an RIA firm were asked to consider a scenario where their own firm could not take on a client and had to recommend another RIA firm they appreciate. The development of AUM was analyzed both, short and long term based on publicly available data. For the short term view, the growth of AUM over a twelve months period was calculated, from January 2022 to January 2023. For the long term view, the growth of AUM over a five year period was calculated, from 2018 to 2023. In the consideration for the top 500 RIA firms, recommendations had a weight of 20% while development of AUM had a weight of 80% (short term and long term growth were equally weighted) to derive the final score.\\nTop Private Y Combinator Companies, Y Combinator (2023): Inclusion in the 2023 \\'Top Private Y Combinator Companies\\' list is based on the company\\'s valuation from its latest funding round, and all companies on the list are valued at over $150M.\\nTitan participated in the Y Combinator funding cycle in 2018. Y Combinator runs two three-month funding cycles a year, during which selected entrepreneurial teams are given a seed investment in exchange for a small equity stake in the company. The teams move to Silicon Valley for the duration of the cycle, during which they receive intensive mentoring and assistance in refining their business plans, developing their products, and pitching to investors. The cycle culminates in a Demo Day, during which each startup presents a quick pitch to a carefully selected, invite-only audience of investors.\\nBest Wealth Management Solution, Finovate (2022): The \\'Best Wealth Management Solution\\' award is given to a wealth management firm, bank or FI with an excellent new solution to give consumers more control over their future wealth and help them meet long-term financial goals.\\nFastest Growing Retail Investment Brand, Global Brands Magazine (2021): Titan\\'s recognition as the 2021 Fastest Growing Retail Investment Brand by Global Brands Magazine is based on an evaluation process involving a nominations team, an internal research team, and an independent external research agency. Companies are proactively invited to participate, and all nominations are validated and researched for adequate data. The external research agency then scrutinizes the nominations based on various criteria and publicly available data. Final award winners are decided by the internal team based on fundamental objectives and announced on the Global Brands Magazine website.\\nThese recognitions do not evaluate client satisfaction or predict future investment performance.
