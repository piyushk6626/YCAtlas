Their elegant approach to write concise and easily understandable code enhanced my coding practices. I got placed during initial days of campus placement and also got an International offer from Shopee, Singapore. \\n![Yash Goyal](https://res.cloudinary.com/anchal-gupta/image/upload/v1739195366/algou/yash_goyal_s6j4dj.jpg)\\n### Yash Goyal\\nShopee Singapore\\nIn my third year, I tried preparing for Internship on my own but unfortunately didn't get one. So when I came in my 4th year, I decided to ask Manas for his help in my preparation. One big difference I started to observe now was that when I was stuck at a problem, I would not google the results but rather he would give me some sequential hints which would help me think of solutions on my own. This enhanced my problem solving skills and eventually I got a job as a Software Developer in Plivo Communications. \\n![Nalin Abrol](https://d1lrk9cp1c3gxw.cloudfront.net/static/newlanding/profile/nalin.jpeg)\\n### Nalin Abrol\\nPlivo\\nThe first interview is always the hardest for anyone. At algo university, I had the option to attend multiple mock interviews. When I was able to excel in one of the mock interviews then I got the confidence to do it again and again. Swapnil sir believed in me and Manas sir pushed me to dream bigger and to be persistent in my vision. Even without any prior internship experience, I bagged an International offer from Tiktok, Singapore. All thanks to my mentors at Algo University. \\n![Naman Jain](https://i.ibb.co/BG8Xm9Y/Clipboard.jpg)\\n### Naman Jain\\nTiktok Singapore\\nWhen companies started to visit our campus for Internship opportunities, I didn't get any offers so I felt disheartened about it. I talked to Manas and he helped me prepare for Interview by practicing questions designed for me to improve my coding and also making me think like an Interviewer. So when I appeared for Interview for Microsoft, I was well prepared and aced the interview and got a Data Science Internship. \\n![Nikita Agarwal](https://d1lrk9cp1c3gxw.cloudfront.net/static/newlanding/profile/nikita.png)\\n### Nikita Agarwal\\nMicrosoft\\nHaving very little time to prepare for Interview, I found AlgoUniversity's material very helpful. Not only till the interviews but also after completing the interviews, the guidance and long personal discussions I have had when I was deciding between different offers like Codenation, Amazon, Flipkart were really helpful and invaluable. \\n![Anjan M](https://res.cloudinary.com/anchal-gupta/image/upload/v1739195582/algou/anjan_mclfzr.jpg)\\n### Anjan M\\nAmazon\\nI hadn't prepared for Interviews prior to companies visiting our college. After seeing my friends getting selected for Internship in top companies, I started to panic. My friends suggested to me that Manas can help me. Being from an electronics background, I had little knowledge in coding so he helped me in learning coding from scratch and also how to face an interview. Thanks to him, I landed an internship in Walmart Labs. \\n![Aayush Tiwari](https://res.cloudinary.com/anchal-gupta/image/upload/v1739195041/algou/aayush_tiwari_buf1bj.jpg)\\n### Aayush Tiwari\\nWalmart\\n##  Your First Job depends on your college, your Next Job depends on you. \\n# May be you are 5 minutes away from transforming your life!\\n![fill-form](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2965/2965360.png)\\n#### Step 1\\nFill Registration Form\\n![profile-shortlisting](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/954/954591.png)\\n#### Step 2\\nProfile Shortlisting\\n![interview-call](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/484/484525.png)\\n#### Step 3\\nInterview Call\\n![algouniversity-begins](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2196/2196199.png)\\n#### Step 4\\nAlgoUniversity Begins!\\n# Our Alumini Got Offers From\\nDreaming big is the first step to achieving big.

Their elegant approach to write concise and easily understandable code enhanced my coding practices. I got placed during initial days of campus placement and also got an International offer from Shopee, Singapore. \\n![Yash Goyal⟨81⟩]\\n### Yash Goyal\\nShopee Singapore\\nIn my third year, I tried preparing for Internship on my own but unfortunately didn't get one. So when I came in my 4th year, I decided to ask Manas for his help in my preparation. One big difference I started to observe now was that when I was stuck at a problem, I would not google the results but rather he would give me some sequential hints which would help me think of solutions on my own. This enhanced my problem solving skills and eventually I got a job as a Software Developer in Plivo Communications. \\n![Nalin Abrol⟨82⟩]\\n### Nalin Abrol\\nPlivo\\nThe first interview is always the hardest for anyone. At algo university, I had the option to attend multiple mock interviews. When I was able to excel in one of the mock interviews then I got the confidence to do it again and again. Swapnil sir believed in me and Manas sir pushed me to dream bigger and to be persistent in my vision. Even without any prior internship experience, I bagged an International offer from Tiktok, Singapore. All thanks to my mentors at Algo University. \\n![Naman Jain⟨83⟩]\\n### Naman Jain\\nTiktok Singapore\\nWhen companies started to visit our campus for Internship opportunities, I didn't get any offers so I felt disheartened about it. I talked to Manas and he helped me prepare for Interview by practicing questions designed for me to improve my coding and also making me think like an Interviewer. So when I appeared for Interview for Microsoft, I was well prepared and aced the interview and got a Data Science Internship. \\n![Nikita Agarwal⟨84⟩]\\n### Nikita Agarwal\\nMicrosoft\\nHaving very little time to prepare for Interview, I found AlgoUniversity's material very helpful. Not only till the interviews but also after completing the interviews, the guidance and long personal discussions I have had when I was deciding between different offers like Codenation, Amazon, Flipkart were really helpful and invaluable. \\n![Anjan M⟨85⟩]\\n### Anjan M\\nAmazon\\nI hadn't prepared for Interviews prior to companies visiting our college. After seeing my friends getting selected for Internship in top companies, I started to panic. My friends suggested to me that Manas can help me. Being from an electronics background, I had little knowledge in coding so he helped me in learning coding from scratch and also how to face an interview. Thanks to him, I landed an internship in Walmart Labs. \\n![Aayush Tiwari⟨86⟩]\\n### Aayush Tiwari\\nWalmart\\n##  Your First Job depends on your college, your Next Job depends on you. \\n# May be you are 5 minutes away from transforming your life!\\n![fill-form⟨87⟩]\\n#### Step 1\\nFill Registration Form\\n![profile-shortlisting⟨88⟩]\\n#### Step 2\\nProfile Shortlisting\\n![interview-call⟨89⟩]\\n#### Step 3\\nInterview Call\\n![algouniversity-begins⟨90⟩]\\n#### Step 4\\nAlgoUniversity Begins!\\n# Our Alumini Got Offers From\\nDreaming big is the first step to achieving big.

  "generated_description": "**AlgoUniversity - A Fresh Take on Tech Education in India**\n\nFounded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S21, AlgoUniversity is on a mission to build a job-driven virtual tech university dedicated to the aspirations of Indian students. With a base in Hyderabad, this innovative edtech startup aims to address the skills gap in the tech industry through a unique model of education and mentorship.\n\n### **The Model**\n\nAt its core, AlgoUniversity combines rigorous live instruction from top-tier educators—many of whom hail from giants like Google and Facebook—with a real-world approach to learning. Students engage in year-long cohorts, and they only begin to pay for their education once they secure a job in the tech field, a model known as the Income Sharing Agreement (ISA). \n\n### **What They Offer**\n\n- **Hands-On Learning:** The curriculum focuses heavily on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which are crucial for tech interviews, making up about 60-70% of the interview process. Students also undertake industry-oriented projects under the guidance of experienced mentors.\n  \n- **Placement Success:** The results speak volumes—over 1,380 students have been trained and placed, with the highest CTC reaching ₹41 LPA and an average hike of about 110% on their previous salaries.\n\n- **Special Programs:** Their weekend-oriented \"Leap Batch\" is catered to working professionals, designed by alumni of IIIT-Hyderabad and IIT-Bombay. This program emphasizes quick doubt resolution, externship certificates, and job placements that can begin just three months after starting.\n\n### **The Team**\n\nAlgoUniversity boasts a small, agile team of just 10 employees—many of whom are ACM ICPC finalists and engineers from leading tech companies. The founders and mentors are not only educators but also seasoned professionals who understand the demands of the tech industry inside out.\n\n### **Proven Impact**\n\nStudents like Mayank Verma and Pallavi Sahu have shared their transformative experiences, highlighting how the curriculum and mentorship at AlgoUniversity enabled them to transition from non-tech jobs to lucrative software engineering positions. The testimonials are filled with stories of impressive salary hikes, international offers, and successful career switches.\n\n### **Financing Your Education**\n\nTheir fee structure is straightforward: an initial ₹5,000 enrollment fee (refundable within 21 days) and subsequent payments of ₹5,000 per month for six months. Once employed, students pay an additional ₹40,000 in easy installments—making it a low-risk investment for those eager to enter the tech workforce.\n\n### **Join the Movement**\n\nWith a clear focus on meeting the staffing needs of the thriving tech industry in India, AlgoUniversity is not just a place for lectures but a stepping stone to a successful career in technology. As they say, if you can dream it, they can help you achieve it. Check out their website at [algouniversity.com](http://algouniversity.com) and take the first step toward transforming your career in tech."
