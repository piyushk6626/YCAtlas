Just pick what you’re most interested in, and go from there.\\n[Start here](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/career-guide/>)\\nWhat do you mean by ‘high-impact career’?\\n    \\nRoughly speaking, the positive impact of your career depends on how many people (or other ‘[moral patients](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/topic/foundations/moral-philosophy/moral-patients/>)‘) you help, how much you help them, and how long the effects last.\\nIf you’d like a more precise answer, see [our full article on how to define doing good](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/articles/what-is-social-impact-definition/>).\\n[Learn more](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/articles/what-is-social-impact-definition/>)\\nWhy should I listen to your career advice?\\n    \\nLots of career advice isn’t based on much more than opinion and personal anecdotes. We try to do better by drawing on:\\n  * Our experience from career advising calls with over five thousand people\\n  * More than a decade of researching, [interviewing experts](http://80000hours.org/</podcast/>), and writing about high-impact careers\\n  * The best available research and academic literature — including advice from relevant experts and professionals, such as hiring managers\\n  * Research on [decision making](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/career-decision/article/>)\\n\\n\\nUltimately, though, you _shouldn’t_ just take our word for it — we’re probably wrong in lots of ways, and have changed our views over time. That’s why we try to be transparent about our reasoning, so you can make up your own mind.\\n[More on our research principles](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/about/credibility/research-principles/>)\\nWhy do you focus on certain global problems?\\n    \\nOur list of pressing global problems sets out the problems where we think **our readers can have the biggest positive impact by working on them**.\\nWe prioritise problems that are unusually large in scale, unduly neglected, and solvable — because [that’s where additional people can generally have the most positive impact](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/career-guide/most-pressing-problems/>).\\nRight now, problems that could pose [existential risks](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/>) top our list, because they threaten not just those alive today but also humanity’s entire future, and they remain neglected relative to their scale.\\nIn particular, we think that there’s a realistic possibility of [transformative AI](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#making-advances-extremely-quickly>) in the coming decades. We think addressing risks from this transformative technology may be the most pressing problem in the world.\\nOur ranking is a best guess and a constant work in progress, meaning it’s undoubtedly incomplete and mistaken in many ways. It also may not align with your worldview. So we encourage you to think through the question of which problems are most pressing for yourself too. Where you focus will also depend on your opportunities to contribute to each issue.\\nTo learn why we listed a specific problem and how you can help tackle it, [read the full profile for yourself](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/problem-profiles/>).\\n[Read more](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/problem-profiles/>)\\nWhy do you talk about AI so much?\\n    \\nWe’ve been talking about risks from advanced AI since 2014, and we’ve ranked it as the [world’s most pressing problem](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/problem-profiles/>) since 2016.\\nIn recent years, AI has made enormous progress and continues to advance, and we’re worried that society isn’t on track to tackle the risks.\\nWe think advanced AI systems could:\\n  * Worsen [great power conflict](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/problem-profiles/great-power-conflict/>)\\n  * [Empower dangerous actors](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#other-risks>), like terrorists or dictators\\n  * [Become power-seeking](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#power-seeking-ai>) on their own and disempower humanity\\n  * [Otherwise lead to significant harms](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/topic/world-problems/most-pressing-problems/artificial-intelligence/>)\\n\\n\\nIn short, the harms are potentially catastrophic and approaching quickly — and not enough is being done about them.\\nWe’re not sure exactly how advanced AI will develop, but companies are racing fast to build it, and world governments and individuals can hardly keep up — so the window to influence its trajectory might be closing.\\nWe think more people should probably be paying attention and trying to help influence the development of AI for the better while curtailing the worst risks.\\nRead more in [our problem profile on risks from advanced artificial intelligence](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/>).\\n[Read more](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/>)\\nHow is all of this free?\\n    \\nWe’re a nonprofit, and our work is fully funded by donors, whom we list [here](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/about/donors/>).\\nOur goal is to make as much progress on the world’s most pressing problems as possible, and by making our advice free, we can reach more people.\\nWe don’t take any corporate sponsorship or run ads in our content, which helps us avoid bias.

So, our advice is primarily aimed at people who have the good fortune to be able to focus on that, and who have the security to change paths.\\nDue to our limited capacity, some of our advice focuses on a narrow range of paths, which can be competitive and demanding.\\nIf you’re not able to change your career right now, see [our advice on how to have a big impact without changing your job](http://80000hours.org/<https:/80000hours.org/career-guide/making-a-difference/>), through advocacy, political engagement, and donations.\\nMany people are not in a position to prioritise social impact, let alone make it a central focus, and that’s fine — we also have many priorities in life besides impact.

And how can you help me?\\n    \\nWe help people — and maybe you — use their careers to solve the world’s most pressing problems.\\nWe do that by providing in-depth research and resources on top problems and how you can use your career to address them.\\nWhat we offer:\\n  * Our online research, which includes:\\n    * Our career guide, covering our core advice\\n    * Our profiles of pressing world problems\\n    * Our reviews of high-impact career paths\\n    * Our articles on valuable skills\\n    * And many other articles and publications\\n  * Our podcast — in-depth interviews about the world’s most pressing problems, and how you can help solve them\\n  * Our job board — with current opportunities to work on big and neglected problems and build skills\\n  * Our one-on-one service — providing individualised career advice for our more engaged readers, helping them make concrete plans and important career connections, and matching some users to key high-impact roles\\n\\n\\nWe recommend starting with our career guide⟨3⟩, which will help you get ideas, form a plan, and put it into action.\\nLearn more⟨110⟩\\nWhere should I start? This is a lot.\\n    \\nStart with our career guide⟨3⟩.\\nOr if you want something even shorter, we wrote a two-minute summary⟨170⟩ with the key takeaways.\\nKeep in mind that you don’t need to read everything to make use of our advice! Just pick what you’re most interested in, and go from there.\\nStart here⟨171⟩\\nWhat do you mean by ‘high-impact career’?\\n    \\nRoughly speaking, the positive impact of your career depends on how many people (or other ‘moral patients⟨172⟩‘) you help, how much you help them, and how long the effects last.\\nIf you’d like a more precise answer, see our full article on how to define doing good⟨173⟩.\\nLearn more⟨173⟩\\nWhy should I listen to your career advice?\\n    \\nLots of career advice isn’t based on much more than opinion and personal anecdotes. We try to do better by drawing on:\\n  * Our experience from career advising calls with over five thousand people\\n  * More than a decade of researching, interviewing experts⟨100⟩, and writing about high-impact careers\\n  * The best available research and academic literature — including advice from relevant experts and professionals, such as hiring managers\\n  * Research on decision making⟨174⟩\\n\\n\\nUltimately, though, you _shouldn’t_ just take our word for it — we’re probably wrong in lots of ways, and have changed our views over time. That’s why we try to be transparent about our reasoning, so you can make up your own mind.\\nMore on our research principles⟨175⟩\\nWhy do you focus on certain global problems?\\n    \\nOur list of pressing global problems sets out the problems where we think **our readers can have the biggest positive impact by working on them**.\\nWe prioritise problems that are unusually large in scale, unduly neglected, and solvable — because that’s where additional people can generally have the most positive impact⟨176⟩.\\nRight now, problems that could pose existential risks⟨177⟩ top our list, because they threaten not just those alive today but also humanity’s entire future, and they remain neglected relative to their scale.\\nIn particular, we think that there’s a realistic possibility of transformative AI⟨178⟩ in the coming decades. We think addressing risks from this transformative technology may be the most pressing problem in the world.\\nOur ranking is a best guess and a constant work in progress, meaning it’s undoubtedly incomplete and mistaken in many ways. It also may not align with your worldview. So we encourage you to think through the question of which problems are most pressing for yourself too. Where you focus will also depend on your opportunities to contribute to each issue.\\nTo learn why we listed a specific problem and how you can help tackle it, read the full profile for yourself⟨179⟩.\\nRead more⟨179⟩\\nWhy do you talk about AI so much?\\n    \\nWe’ve been talking about risks from advanced AI since 2014, and we’ve ranked it as the world’s most pressing problem⟨179⟩ since 2016.\\nIn recent years, AI has made enormous progress and continues to advance, and we’re worried that society isn’t on track to tackle the risks.\\nWe think advanced AI systems could:\\n  * Worsen great power conflict⟨180⟩\\n  * Empower dangerous actors⟨181⟩, like terrorists or dictators\\n  * Become power-seeking⟨182⟩ on their own and disempower humanity\\n  * Otherwise lead to significant harms⟨183⟩\\n\\n\\nIn short, the harms are potentially catastrophic and approaching quickly — and not enough is being done about them.\\nWe’re not sure exactly how advanced AI will develop, but companies are racing fast to build it, and world governments and individuals can hardly keep up — so the window to influence its trajectory might be closing.\\nWe think more people should probably be paying attention and trying to help influence the development of AI for the better while curtailing the worst risks.\\nRead more in our problem profile on risks from advanced artificial intelligence⟨184⟩.\\nRead more⟨184⟩\\nHow is all of this free?\\n    \\nWe’re a nonprofit, and our work is fully funded by donors, whom we list here⟨114⟩.\\nOur goal is to make as much progress on the world’s most pressing problems as possible, and by making our advice free, we can reach more people.\\nWe don’t take any corporate sponsorship or run ads in our content, which helps us avoid bias. We also never sell user data, and don’t have any hidden fees or charges.\\nRead more⟨110⟩\\nIs this advice aimed at me?\\n    \\nThat depends!\\nWe think lots of our advice — such as our career guide⟨3⟩ — will be useful for anyone who is interested in doing more good with their career, or even just curious.\\nThat said, our aim is to help people tackle the world’s biggest and most neglected problems. So, our advice is primarily aimed at people who have the good fortune to be able to focus on that, and who have the security to change paths.\\nDue to our limited capacity, some of our advice focuses on a narrow range of paths, which can be competitive and demanding.\\nIf you’re not able to change your career right now, see our advice on how to have a big impact without changing your job⟨185⟩, through advocacy, political engagement, and donations.\\nMany people are not in a position to prioritise social impact, let alone make it a central focus, and that’s fine — we also have many priorities in life besides impact. But if you do want to make a big difference, we hope we can help.\\nRead more⟨186⟩\\nShould I apply to speak to you 1-1?\\n    \\nYes!\\nBecause we have limited capacity to speak to people, we aren’t able to have a call with everyone who applies. But **the application form⟨187⟩ only takes 10 minutes**! So it’s worth filling out for most people — and if we don’t speak to you this time, you can always apply again in six months.\\nWe’re looking to speak with people who:\\n  * Make social impact one of their main career goals\\n  * Take an analytical approach to social impact and career choice\\n  * Are already somewhat familiar with the basic principles presented in our career guide⟨3⟩\\n  * Are interested in working on our pressing problems⟨20⟩, especially helping mitigate risks from AI or other pressing problems exacerbated by AI\\n  * Have the ability to excel in a challenging career\\n\\n\\nWe speak to people at all stages of their career, and you don’t need to already know exactly what you want to work on, or have a preexisting career plan.\\nIf that sounds like you, then you should definitely apply⟨187⟩!\\nApply now⟨187⟩\\nWhat career should I choose? How should I decide?\\n    \\nThat’s what our whole site is all about!\\nAnd yes, it’s not an easy question, but we’re here to help you answer it.\\nStart by reading our career guide⟨3⟩ (or this two-minute summary⟨170⟩). It will guide you through the rest.\\nAlternatively, if you just want to browse possible high-impact career paths, you can check out our career reviews⟨46⟩.\\nStart here⟨171⟩\\nWhat’s your best piece of advice?\\n    \\nBuild useful skills⟨188⟩, and then use them to tackle pressing global problems⟨179⟩.\\nThis might sound obvious — but in practice, very few people do this.\\nMany efforts to do good are far less effective than they could be, because they aren’t focused on the problems where additional effort has the biggest impact.

  "generated_description": "**80,000 Hours: Your Career, Your Impact**\n\nFounded in 2011 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S15, 80,000 Hours is a nonprofit based in London dedicated to helping graduates leverage their careers for maximum positive impact. The focus is straightforward: provide evidence-based career advice for using your work to tackle the world’s most pressing problems.\n\n**What Do They Offer?**\nTheir centerpiece is the **80,000 Hours Career Guide**, which distills over a decade of research and insights into actionable steps. It answers key questions like, \"What makes a dream job?\" and \"Can one person really make a difference?\" The guide is tailored to help individuals clarify their ambitions and navigate career paths that genuinely make the world a better place.\n\nIn addition to the guide, they offer personalized advice through one-on-one coaching sessions, equipping individuals with tailored strategies and connections. Their resources tap into a wide range of issues, from **AI safety** to **pandemic prevention**, focusing on areas where efforts are particularly necessary yet under-discussed.\n\n**Core Mission and Philosophy**\nThe essence of 80,000 Hours hinges on a simple yet profound insight: you have around 80,000 hours in your career, presenting a tremendous opportunity to create a positive impact. The organization actively encourages people to think about the scale and neglectedness of the problems they want to address, guiding them toward impactful choices in their professional lives.\n\n**Who Is It For?**\nWhile the primary audience consists of talented grads aged 18–30, the insights and resources available are beneficial to anyone aiming to make a difference. They approach philanthropic work without corporate sponsorships, meaning all of their support is freely accessible, funded solely through donations.\n\n**High-Impact Career Paths**\nThey outline several top career paths, including roles related to **AI governance**, **global health**, and **biosecurity policy**. Their goal is to ensure that individuals are not just making choices based on passions or trends but are effectively aligning their careers with the most pressing needs of society.\n\n**Conclusion**\n80,000 Hours isn’t just about career advice; it’s about rethinking how individuals can contribute to a better world through their career decisions. By providing clarity on problems worth tackling and the skills necessary to succeed, they empower the next generation to not only choose careers but also to create a legacy of positive impact. For anyone ready to dive deeper, the resources await at [80000hours.org](http://80000hours.org), where you can start along this meaningful journey."
