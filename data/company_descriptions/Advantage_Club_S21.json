We have renamed that as Interest Forums. We're trying to build cohorts, which is geography-agnostic, which is channel-agnostic as one team. Choose a reward program - Advantage Club is helping us to implement that. \\n![](https://cdn0.workadvantage.in/images/cdn_upload/cdn/8432/5fd0b9ef6b.svg)\\n![TataSteelLogo⟨18⟩]\\n![](https://cdn2.workadvantage.in/images/cdn_upload/cdn/5354/73c823c2c3.png)\\nAdvantage Club is an excellent rewards and recognition platform. Tata Steel have onboarded Advantage Club. The best thing is customization and we required a lot of customization in our recognition program. So Advantage Club has gone ahead and done that for us. It gives a comprehensive solution to me. So there is a solution to go and give rewards to people, there is an e-marketplace, and it caters to all segments of our employees. So Advantage Club for me is the best recognition portal that is available in the market today. \\n![](https://cdn0.workadvantage.in/images/cdn_upload/cdn/8432/5fd0b9ef6b.svg)\\n![TeleperformanceLogo⟨58⟩]\\n![](https://cdn2.workadvantage.in/images/cdn_upload/cdn/5354/73c823c2c3.png)\\nAdvantage Club is doing a great job.
