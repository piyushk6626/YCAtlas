With MerchantProfiler, teams instantly receive merchant lead data: KYB checks, industry classification, website & social media analysis. With the Coris platform, teams can generate custom rules and actions on this data to rank and reach out to leads accordingly.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6570f033beae2d428c9f4468/66e380b8795e8750684c7543_Icon%20-%20Industry%20Classification.png)\\nOnboarding\\nOnboarding teams need to make sense of multiple merchant data sources and decide on applications quickly. The Coris platform enables teams to combine merchant data from multiple sources (Stripe, Adyen, etc.), set up custom rules based on this data, and automate actions. Reduce friction for good merchants while streamlining reviews for suspicious applications.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6570f033beae2d428c9f4468/66e380f0e1192fc2ad4fcdf8_Icon%20-%20first%20party%20\\\\(1\\\\).png)\\nMerchant Fraud\\nWith fraud on the rise, risk teams need to quickly assess new merchant applications for signs of questionable identity or intent. CorShield reduces third-party and first-party fraud by cross-checking an application\\'s information against all known information on the business. For example, it can assess the likelihood that a given email address, phone number, or mailing address is actually controlled by the business.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6570f033beae2d428c9f4468/66e38140775ecfa79011f488_Group%201000002601.png)\\nUnderwriting\\nUnderwriters are under pressure to make decisions quickly, and sometimes critical risk checks are overlooked. The Coris platform\\'s rule engine eliminates the risk of manual errors by automating checks and actions, increasing accuracy and efficiency.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6570f033beae2d428c9f4468/66e3817145495552c700647e_Group%2012677.png)\\nTransaction Monitoring\\nFraudulent ACH returns - aka \"friendly fraud\" - negatively impact merchants and the software platforms that serve them.

Risk teams can use the Coris platform to stay on top of suspicious activity by setting up custom alerts and checks for key events. For example, when a merchant initiates a payout, risk teams can check their chargeback history on Stripe Connect or Adyen for Platforms before deciding to release the payout.\\nGet in touch\\n## Elevate your SMB risk management today\\nContact Us⟨2⟩\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6570f033beae2d428c9f4468/66e479cb3a8ecbc5b5777587_Ellipse%20145%20\\\\(1\\\\).png)\\n![⟨1⟩](https://coris.ai/</>)\\nExplore\\nIntegrations⟨9⟩Developers⟨10⟩About Us⟨11⟩Resources⟨12⟩\\nlegal\\nPrivacy Policy⟨20⟩Terms & Conditions⟨21⟩\\nconnect\\nLinkedIn⟨22⟩Twitter⟨23⟩\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6570f033beae2d428c9f4468/6570f033beae2d428c9f45a4_AICPA%20logo.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6570f033beae2d428c9f4468/6570f033beae2d428c9f4549_Line%20307%20\\\\(1\\\\).svg)\\n©2025 Coris, Inc.
