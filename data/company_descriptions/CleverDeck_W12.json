So, for example, I might review something today, then tomorrow, then in four days, then in two weeks. It's a simple idea with incredible results: you end up spending much less time studying while remembering things much better over the long-term. Furthermore, by tracking whether or not you remember things, a spaced repetition system (SRS) can customize review intervals for every individual piece of information - so you spend more time with things you're having trouble learning, and very little time with things you've mastered easily.\\nWhat learning algorithms does CleverDeck use?\\nCleverDeck uses the SM-2 algorithm with a few very minor customizations. This is the same algorithm battle-tested and popularized by other spaced repetition systems such as SuperMemo and Anki. Most of the algorithm's parameters can be customized in the app.\\nWhat does CleverDeck cost?\\nIt's free to create and study your own content. Otherwise, it's $3 per month for unlimited access to all our premium decks. There's a freemium that's big enough to let you decide if the premium content is worth paying for. You should cancel if you no longer find the app useful, and I make it really easy to do that.\\nWill there be an Android version?\\nAs an independent developer, I'm unfortunately very resource-limited and don't have the bandwidth to jump into Android right now. Time or money permitting, I'd love to make an Android version in the near future.\\n[](http://cleverdeck.com/<https:/itunes.apple.com/us/app/cleverdeck-spaced-repetition-flashcards/id881765907?ls=1&mt=8>)\\n[Manual](http://cleverdeck.com/</manual/>) |  [People](http://cleverdeck.com/</people/>) |  [Twitter](http://cleverdeck.com/<https:/twitter.com/clever_deck>) |  [Privacy](http://cleverdeck.com/</privacy/>) |  [Terms](http://cleverdeck.com/</tos/>) |  [Download](http://cleverdeck.com/<https:/itunes.apple.com/us/app/cleverdeck-spaced-repetition-flashcards/id881765907?ls=1&mt=8>)\\nNeed something?

  "generated_description": "# CleverDeck: Your Language Learning Companion\n\n**Website**: [CleverDeck.com](http://cleverdeck.com)  \n**Location**: Istanbul, Turkey  \n**Founded**: Y Combinator Batch W12  \n\n### Mission\nAt its core, CleverDeck is about collaboration and creativity, aiming to commission original artwork from artists to enrich your learning experience. \n\n### What is CleverDeck?\nOriginally launched as a customizable spaced repetition flashcard app, CleverDeck is designed to help users learn foreign language vocabulary effectively.

However, there is hope that an Android app will blossom down the line.\n\n### Why Choose CleverDeck?\nBy marrying innovative technology with expert-sourced content, CleverDeck not only streamlines language acquisition but does so in a way that respects the user's time and investment. Their functional design fosters a unique learning environment where creativity and practicality coexist.\n\nWhether you’re a traveler prepping for your next adventure or someone wanting to enhance your language skills, CleverDeck offers a pathway to effective and enjoyable learning.
