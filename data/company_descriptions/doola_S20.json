We take care of everything creators need to form an LLC, set up their bank account, accept payments, and manage ongoing compliance and tax filings. We realized how difficult it was to set up the full stack of software and accounts you need to get a business off the ground. This is the same problem faced by online businesses, who begin their business as a side hustle, and just want to focus on growing their business, not annoying administrative work. Thatâs why we built doola: to take care of it all. Today, people on every continent have launched companies with doola. (HQ: New York)",

An LLC limits your personal liability in case of legal or financial issues, while a business bank account helps you separate personal and business finances, making tax preparation easier and ensuring a more professional image for your business.\\n### Do I need to be a US citizen to work with doola?\\nNo, you don’t! We work with entrepreneurs from around the world to get their businesses incorporated. Don’t take our word for it, though; check out our [TrustPilot Page](https://www.doola.com/<https:/www.trustpilot.com/review/doola.com>) to hear what people globally have to say about doola.\\n### What is an LLC (Limited Liability Company)?\\nA limited liability company is a formal business structure (created as per state law) where the business is legally distinct from the owner(s). It may have a single owner in the case of a Single-Member LLC or multiple owners in the case of a Multi-Member LLC.\\nAn LLC combines the perks of a corporation (protection against personal liability) and a partnership (pass-through taxation). Since the business has a separate legal existence, the members are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the Company.\\nState laws stipulate how LLCs should be incorporated. Some states require specific documents, such as the articles of organization, membership agreement, etc., to be filed with the authorities.\\nLearn more about LLCs and how they work in [FREE ebook.](https://www.doola.com/<https:/www.doola.com/beginners-guide-to-llcs/>)\\n### What information do you need from me to get started?\\nWe don't need any documents to get started. We just need a few pieces of info from you:\\n  * Your Company Name\\n  * Your Personal Address\\n  * Phone Number and Email (For contact purposes) \\n\\n\\nLater in the process, you'll need a passport to set up your bank account.\\n### What is an ITIN?\\nAn Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) can be used as an alternative for a Social Security Number (SSN) in some cases and is not a requirement in most cases. However, you will be required to have one if you wish to apply for a PayPal account or certain bank accounts.

An LLC limits your personal liability in case of legal or financial issues, while a business bank account helps you separate personal and business finances, making tax preparation easier and ensuring a more professional image for your business.\\n### Do I need to be a US citizen to work with doola?\\nNo, you don’t! We work with entrepreneurs from around the world to get their businesses incorporated. Don’t take our word for it, though; check out our TrustPilot Page⟨50⟩ to hear what people globally have to say about doola.\\n### What is an LLC (Limited Liability Company)?\\nA limited liability company is a formal business structure (created as per state law) where the business is legally distinct from the owner(s). It may have a single owner in the case of a Single-Member LLC or multiple owners in the case of a Multi-Member LLC.\\nAn LLC combines the perks of a corporation (protection against personal liability) and a partnership (pass-through taxation). Since the business has a separate legal existence, the members are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the Company.\\nState laws stipulate how LLCs should be incorporated. Some states require specific documents, such as the articles of organization, membership agreement, etc., to be filed with the authorities.\\nLearn more about LLCs and how they work in FREE ebook.⟨51⟩\\n### What information do you need from me to get started?\\nWe don't need any documents to get started. We just need a few pieces of info from you:\\n  * Your Company Name\\n  * Your Personal Address\\n  * Phone Number and Email (For contact purposes) \\n\\n\\nLater in the process, you'll need a passport to set up your bank account.\\n### What is an ITIN?\\nAn Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) can be used as an alternative for a Social Security Number (SSN) in some cases and is not a requirement in most cases. However, you will be required to have one if you wish to apply for a PayPal account or certain bank accounts.
