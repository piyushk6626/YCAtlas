HealthSpark in as little as 30 days, or as soon as you are in-network.\\n### Frequently Asked Questions\\n###### What is HealthSpark?\\nWe are a multi-state network of licensed physical therapists, dedicated to helping independent PTs succeed while empowering people to move better, recover faster, and live healthier lives.\\n###### Will I be an employee of HealthSpark?\\nPhysical therapists use the HealthSpark platform to build and expand their own private practices. You’re in charge: running your own business, setting your schedule, and working on your terms, not as an employee. At tax time, you’ll receive a 1099 form from HealthSpark to file as an independent contractor.\\n###### Does this impact my existing clients?\\nNo! HealthSpark will not restrict your current practice, but help it expand. Credentialing through HealthSpark will not restrict your ability to see self-pay clients under your own tax ID.\\n###### What is the commitment?\\nThere is no minimum hour commitment to join. We are here to support you, not dictate how you practice.\\n###### How long does it take to set up?\\nOn average, you’ll be able to start seeing clients on HealthSpark within 1-4 months. If you have previously been in-network, the credentialing process can often be expedited.\\n###### Is there a contract I need to sign?\\nYes, you’ll need to sign credentialing documents, agree to our terms of service agreement for providers, and sign a standard independent contractor agreement.\\n###### Is there a cost to join?\\nNo, it's completely free to join HealthSpark.\\n###### Do you support telehealth or home health providers? \\nYes, you can see patients however you see fit, whether via telehealth, home health, mobile health, or a typical brick and mortar clinic. \\n###### How do I get new clients?\\nHealthSpark helps you access new clients and grow your caseload through online advertising, physician referrals, and more. We encourage you to explore self sourcing as well so you can grow your caseload alongside our efforts.\\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6736ce2ddafc89ffd84d7bfb/6736e20eb686c25549304778_Transparent%20Logo%20No%20Padding.png)](https://www.joinhealthspark.com/</>)\\n[![Ecommerce Webflow Template - Poppins](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6736ce2ddafc89ffd84d7bfb/6736ce2ddafc89ffd84d7d30_66c42679a0a118c60d5ea081_LinkedIN.svg)](https://www.joinhealthspark.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/health-spark/>)[](https://www.joinhealthspark.com/<https:/x.com/joinhealthspark>)\\nCompany\\n[About](https://www.joinhealthspark.com/</about>)[](https://www.joinhealthspark.com/</contact-page>)[](https://www.joinhealthspark.com/</blog>)\\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.joinhealthspark.com/</privacy-policy>)\\n© Copyright 2025 HealthSpark, Inc.

  "generated_description": "Welcome to HealthSpark—a company that’s reimagining physical therapy using AI. Founded in 2024 and proudly part of Y Combinator's Batch F24, HealthSpark is based in San Francisco. With a lean team of two, they’re on a mission to empower physical therapists to create and manage their own independent, AI-driven practices efficiently.\n\nSo, what does that look like? HealthSpark takes the pain out of practice management by handling the administrative drudgery—insurance credentialing, scheduling, call management, and charting—allowing therapists to focus on what they do best: helping patients recover and thrive. Their platform includes an AI-native Electronic Health Record (EHR) and a Call Inbox, making it easier for practitioners to keep their operations smooth and client-focused.\n\nDalton Caldwell, a seasoned partner, is a guiding force behind this innovative venture. It’s no wonder HealthSpark has resonated with those in the health tech space—they’re merging cutting-edge artificial intelligence with essential healthcare services to improve patient outcomes.\n\nImagine starting your own practice with minimal hassle. HealthSpark's offerings include a comprehensive dashboard for clients, secure messaging, billing management, and even marketing support to attract new clients. It’s a refreshing take on traditional practice management, putting control firmly in the therapists' hands, while providing all the tools they need to be successful.\n\nWorried about existing clients? HealthSpark won’t constrain your current practice; it's designed to enhance and grow it. And the best part? There’s no cost to join. It’s all about creating a supportive network for licensed physical therapists—whether they want to see clients in-person, through telehealth, or even in a home health setting.\n\nAll this is a mere scratch of the surface. If you're intrigued and want to dive deeper, visit [HealthSpark’s website](https://www.joinhealthspark.com) and explore how they’re making private practice easier and more rewarding for therapists everywhere."
