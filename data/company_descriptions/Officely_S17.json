  "generated_description": "**Officely: Simplifying the Hybrid Workplace Experience**\n\n**Website**: [Officely](https://www.getofficely.com?utm_source=yc)  \n**Founded**: 2017  \n**Location**: London, United Kingdom  \n**Team Size**: 11 employees  \n**Y Combinator**: Batch S17  \n**Mission**: To build next-generation tools for the hybrid workplace.\n\n### Overview\nOfficely is addressing a fundamental challenge in the modern workplace: the shift to hybrid work. Created to streamline the office experience, Officely allows teams to see who’s in the office and when, enabling flexible desk booking, social planning, and important updates. With its user-friendly metrics, office managers can easily track attendance and gain insights into office usage—all while maintaining a beautiful and intuitive design.\n\n### Core Features\n1. **Hot Desk Booking**: Easily book desks for in-office days.\n2. **Meeting Room Management**: Simplify the process of reserving meeting spaces and managing attendance.\n3. **Office Parking Management**: Reserve parking spots to eliminate the chaos of parking logistics.\n4. **Employee Visibility**: Regular updates to the team about who will be in the office, boosting attendance and camaraderie.\n\n### Why Use Officely?\nThe platform integrates seamlessly with the tools teams are already using—like Slack and Microsoft Teams—making it easy for employees to adapt without complicating their workflow. This ease of integration is crucial, as traditional booking applications often deter team usage due to clunky interfaces and multiple logins.\n\n### Pricing Plans\n- **Free Plan**: Up to 5 users, all features included.\n- **Premium Plan**: $4/user/month, unlimited users.\n- **Basic Plan**: $2.50/user/month, also supporting unlimited users, focusing on desk booking.\n\nOfficely is currently offering a 20% discount as a seasonal promotion, emphasizing their commitment to accessibility and value for teams looking to enhance their hybrid work arrangements.\n\n### Client Testimonials\nCustomers praise Officely for its intuitive design and practicality in the hybrid workplace. Users highlight the ease of booking desks and the visibility it provides into team presence, which helps maintain workplace culture and collaboration.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn a world where flexible work models are becoming the norm, Officely stands out as a necessary tool for businesses aiming to navigate this transition efficiently. By placing users at the center of its design and focusing on integration with existing tools, Officely effectively bridges the gap between remote and in-office work, making office life easier for everyone involved. \n\nFor businesses looking to modernize their approach to workspace management, Officely presents a compelling solution."
