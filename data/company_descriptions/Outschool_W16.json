  "description": "Outschool is an innovative education platform that offers a variety of engaging, small-group classes online. Unlike traditional classes, Outschool classes give kids the unique opportunity to explore their interests in-depth via interactive, live video by experienced, independent educators.\r\n\nWhen Outschool was founded in 2015, homeschoolers were the first to discover our classes, but it wasnât long before kids in conventional schools began supplementing their education with fun and unique, interest-based classes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Outschool became vital to families who wanted to keep kids learning, social, and pursuing their passions.\r\nToday, Outschool offers more than 140,000 live online classes to more than 1,000,000 learners in 183 countries worldwide.",
