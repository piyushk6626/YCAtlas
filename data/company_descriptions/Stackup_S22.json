  "generated_description": "Stackup is a promising startup based in Los Angeles, CA, that is focused on simplifying the complex world of cryptocurrency management for businesses. Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's S22 batch, Stackup aims to empower companies to take control of their crypto assets through a smart account platform.\n\n### What They Do\nStackup's mission is about managing digital assets efficiently. Their platform offers features that allow businesses to streamline their on-chain operations, automate tasks, and gain full visibility into their crypto transactions. Essentially, they transform the chaos of traditional wallets into a centralized control system for decentralized assets.\n\nBy providing a way to manage on-chain finances without the usual hassles—think cumbersome hardware wallets or convoluted transaction processes—Stackup is targeting the crypto sector’s need for clarity and security. Their tools facilitate everything from payroll to invoice payments, all while ensuring assets remain secure.\n\n### Key Features\n1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Assign specific permissions for team members, reducing errors and safeguarding sensitive information.\n2. **Passkey Authentication**: Eliminate cumbersome private keys with user-friendly passkeys.\n3. **Automated Billing**: Send invoices and schedule payments directly from the platform.\n4. **Real-Time Reporting**: Get an accurate view of all transactions without back-and-forth communication with staff.\n5. **Non-Custodial Control**: Maintain full custody over your tokens, transacting freely across multiple blockchains.\n\n### The Founding Team\nStackup was co-founded by John Rising, who brings experience from SpaceX, and Hazim Jumali, a tech veteran from Afterpay and Accenture. This duo combines deep technical expertise with a visionary outlook on the evolution of blockchain operations.\n\n### Why It Matters\nIn a world where many crypto companies juggle multiple clunky platforms, Stackup positions itself as the solution. It’s designed not just for ease of use but also to cater to the financial complexities that come with the territory of managing digital assets. By automating many of these tasks, Stackup enables businesses to focus on growth rather than getting bogged down in operational minutiae.\n\nYou can learn more about Stackup on their website [here](https://www.stackup.fi). \n\nIn summary, Stackup isn't just another tech startup; it's a bold attempt to redefine how businesses interact with crypto. They’re on a mission to make on-chain finances less of a puzzle—because in the fast-paced crypto world, companies shouldn't be wasting time sorting through chaos. Instead, they should have the tools to take charge and excel."
