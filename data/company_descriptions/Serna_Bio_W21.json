  "generated_description": "### Serna Bio: Unlocking the Potential of RNA Therapeutics\n\n**Overview:**\nFounded in 2021 and hailing from the Y Combinator Batch W21, Serna Bio is making waves in the biotech landscape. Located in Ontario, CA, this innovative company consists of a skilled team of nine, dedicated to harnessing the power of genetic medicine through small molecules.\n\n**Mission:**\nAt its core, Serna Bio aims to revolutionize genetic medicine by developing small molecules aimed at modulating RNA function. This pioneering approach targets diseases that have traditionally resisted treatment by focusing on the transcriptome—the part of the genome that encodes RNA. While only 2% of the human genome produces proteins, a staggering 70% is dedicated to RNA, which poses vast and largely untapped potential for drug discovery.\n\n**What They Do:**\nSerna Bio operates at the cutting-edge intersection of synthetic biology, machine learning (ML), and high-throughput screening. The company’s research and development efforts center on:\n\n1. **Mapping RNA Architecture**: By creating a detailed map of functional RNA structures, they identify druggable RNA motifs across the transcriptome.\n2. **Developing Small Molecules**: These molecules modulate translation and splicing processes to create therapeutics for challenging, high-unmet medical need targets.\n3. **Utilizing AI**: The company has built the world’s largest database of functional RNA structures combined with unique chemical libraries, driving both internal research and external collaborations.\n\n**Current Projects:**\nSerna Bio’s unique approach involves cutting-edge in vitro assays and machine learning technologies. By combining these tools, they've uncovered a deeper understanding of how RNA works, allowing them to innovate in the realm of RNA-targeted therapies. \n\nIf you're intrigued by the confluence of biology and technology, and the promise of RNA as a therapeutic target, Serna Bio is paving the way forward.\n\n**Get in Touch:**\nThe team at Serna Bio welcomes collaboration and new talent to push the boundaries of RNA therapeutics even further. For inquiries or opportunities, you can reach out via their [website](http://serna.bio).\n\n**In Conclusion:**\nSerna Bio is boldly pushing the frontiers of drug discovery by reimagining RNA's role in genetic medicine. With an innovative focus and robust scientific foundation, they stand at the precipice of potentially transformative breakthroughs in how we treat a range of diseases."
