  "generated_description": "**Sourcify: Simplifying Manufacturing for E-commerce Brands**\n\nFounded in 2017 as part of Y Combinator's Batch W18, Sourcify is a San Diego-based company on a mission to facilitate product manufacturing in Asia. Their model is straightforward: they help e-commerce brands and even Fortune 500 companies manufacture products efficiently, all while ensuring substantial cost savings and transparency in the supply chain. \n\n**What They Offer**\n\nSourcify is essentially a high-growth sourcing platform where brands can access a network of over 3,000 vetted factories across various product categories—be it fashion, home goods, or accessories. Their expertise translates into significant savings of 10% or more on product margins, as they act as a middleman equipped to share insights and knowledge accrued from years of experience in the manufacturing landscape.\n\nServices include:\n\n- **Sourcing Services:** Tailored solutions for both small influencers and large enterprises.\n- **Production Guides:** Detailed guides for different manufacturing hubs including India, Vietnam, and Mexico.\n- **Factory Network:** Tools to find manufacturers based on specific needs.\n- **Educational Resources:** Their Product Sourcing School provides valuable training, empowering individuals to source and manufacture their own products effectively.\n\n**Why Sourcify Stands Out**\n\nWith a dedicated team of 15, Sourcify fosters a community centered on education and support. Their approach involves not just connecting brands with factories, but also providing continuous consultation through a localized support team, ensuring that clients navigate each step of the sourcing process without the typical headaches. \n\n**Results Driven**\n\nThe numbers back it up: Sourcify has sourced almost 108,000 products and boasts an average response time of just 72 hours for production quotes. They've successfully worked with a variety of well-known brands, all while ensuring quality control before products leave the factories.\n\nFor anyone with manufacturing needs—especially those planning to spend $100k or more annually—Sourcify is worth considering. They’re not just doers; they’re educators and innovators, providing the tools needed for anyone looking to make their mark in the e-commerce space.\n\nTo explore Sourcify's offerings or to get started, check out [Sourcify’s website](https://www.sourcify.com/) or connect directly at 619-473-2149."
