Today AI Voices are used in several applications due to their natural-sounding tone.\\n### What is an AI voice generator?\\nAn AI voice generator, often referred to as a Text to Speech (TTS) system, is a technology that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to convert written text into spoken words. This advanced technology mimics human speech patterns, intonation, and natural language, producing lifelike and human-like voices.\\n### How long does it take to synthesize text into speech?\\nThe [text to speech](https://play.ht/</text-to-speech/>) synthesis is real time in most cases, and only takes a couple of minutes to convert the input text into audio.

There\\\\'s no need for you to wait for the conversion to finish. Once the audio is ready, the files will be available in your dashboard to download.\\n### What customizations can I do with the AI Voices?\\nAll our [AI Voices](https://play.ht/</text-to-speech/>) support [SSML](https://play.ht/<https:/play.ht/blog/what-is-ssml/>) features - rate, pitch, volume and pronunciations.

AI Voices are created by machine learning models that process hundreds of hours of voice recordings from real voiceover artists and then learn to speak based on the audio recordings. Today AI Voices are used in several applications due to their natural-sounding tone.\\n### What is an AI voice generator?\\nAn AI voice generator, often referred to as a Text to Speech (TTS) system, is a technology that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to convert written text into spoken words. This advanced technology mimics human speech patterns, intonation, and natural language, producing lifelike and human-like voices.\\n### How long does it take to synthesize text into speech?\\nThe text to speech⟨16⟩ synthesis is real time in most cases, and only takes a couple of minutes to convert the input text into audio. Our TTS software runs in the cloud, so if you are converting large amounts of text then you can paste it in our voice generator\\\\'s interface and start the conversion. There\\\\'s no need for you to wait for the conversion to finish. Once the audio is ready, the files will be available in your dashboard to download.\\n### What customizations can I do with the AI Voices?\\nAll our AI Voices⟨16⟩ support SSML⟨64⟩ features - rate, pitch, volume and pronunciations. You can add custom pauses for different punctuation marks to create a more natural speaking tone. Adjust the pitch of the voice to make it sound more deeper or child-like. The speaking rate allows you to increase or decrease the speed of voice. With our pronunciations library you can save custom pronunciations and use them whenever you create speech.\\n### Can I use the voices for commercial purpose?\\nYes, all our voices can be used for commercial purposes.

Both require GPUs. Generally, the cost for cloning varies from a few tens to hundred dollars per voice, where as the cost for generating speech depends on the volume of text you are looking to convert to audio. Please check our pricing⟨65⟩ or contact us⟨8⟩ for a quote. \\n### How to generate an AI voice?\\nGenerating an AI Voice is straightforward.
