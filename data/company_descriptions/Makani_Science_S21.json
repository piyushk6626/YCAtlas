  "generated_description": "**Makani Science: Reinventing Respiration Monitoring**\n\nMakani Science is a medical device company based in Irvine, California, founded in 2018. Co-founded by Dr. Michelle Khine and Dr. Michael Chu—experts in wearable monitoring from the University of California, Irvine—Makani aims to transform how we monitor respiration. They’ve developed the world’s first wireless patch designed for accurate and continuous breathing monitoring.\n\nThe mission? To create a comprehensive database of respiratory patterns linked to various diseases by collecting unique breathing waveforms from patients in everyday environments. Starting with a focus on improving safety in patients undergoing sedation during medical procedures, Makani's technology promises to usher in an era of smarter healthcare. The goal is to leverage machine learning on this database to identify and predict respiratory complications across different patient demographics.\n\nCurrently part of Y Combinator’s Batch S21, Makani Science consists of a small but highly experienced team of two employees. They are on a fast track to receiving FDA clearance for their initial market within the year, establishing a solid foundation for future growth.\n\nWith health-tech and medical devices as their core tags, Makani Science shows immense potential in addressing a crucial aspect of patient care—monitoring respiration. Their cutting-edge approach not only meets a pressing healthcare need but also opens avenues for advanced predictive analytics in respiratory health.\n\nFor more information, you can check their website at [Makani Science](http://makaniscience.net/)."
