  "description": "Orbio uses satellite imagery to track methane emissions from the oil & gas industry. We sell the data to financial companies that want to invest into the best performing energy companies.\r\n\nUntil today, oil & gas companies use excel-based emission factors to calculate and report their emissions. As these excel-based emission factors underestimate actual emissions by ~70%, the finance companies that invest into oil & gas can’t mitigate against incoming risks from new regulations, \r\n\nWe have built a technology that can for the first time use satellite images to track methane from every single oil & gas facility on the planet, replacing emission factors and allowing finance companies to make the best bets on oil & gas companies that will withstand a wide avalanche of incoming regulation. In the summer 2023 our satellite-based technology got ranked #1 both in terms of accuracy and sensitivity of methane emission events by Stanford University in a peer-reviewed study, beating a range of multi-bn dollar competitors like Maxar.\r\n\nLearn more at https://orbio.earth",

There are 12 million oil & gas facilities globally capable of emitting methane emissions, and a huge amount go under the radar.Traditional methods fall short in accurately reporting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, leading to a staggering [underreporting of up to 70%.](https://www.orbio.earth/<https:/www.iea.org/news/methane-emissions-from-the-energy-sector-are-70-higher-than-official-figures#:~:text=Global%20methane%20emissions%20from%20the,of%20the%20potent%20greenhouse%20gas.>)\\u200dAs the world braces for stringent regulations with significant financial repercussions, such as the impending IRA methane fee in the US and forthcoming EU regulation, the immediate need for precision in methane emission benchmarking has never been more critical.\\n##### Our partners and collaborators\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657b6a2140ffd3eaffa11213/657b6a2140ffd3eaffa11242_yc.png)\\n# Frequently asked questions\\nHow does the Orbio Earth platform work?\\nOrbio utilises satellite data to capture images of methane every 4 days from any site on earth. We then reconcile this satellite emissions data with emission factor datasets to provide better emission benchmarks of assets, companies and supply chains.\\nWhy is understanding methane emissions important?\\nReducing man-made methane emissions are a win for both the climate and companies in the energy and financial sectors. Stopping these emissions from the energy industry alone could prevent 0.2°C of global warming.To put that into perspective, it would be like taking all cars and trucks off the road globally. Preventing these emissions are surprisingly simple when stakeholders are equipped with the right data.\\nHow is Orbio Earth different?\\nFirstly Orbio can deliver data at high spatial resolutions meaning emissions can be attributed to specific assets. The main methane-specific satellite in use today gives regional scale resolutions making it very difficult to gauge where the source of methane emissions are coming from.Secondly, Orbio has begun reconciling emissions data with non-emission datasets to inform how existing reporting efforts and aid with risk identification.\\nHow can I get involved with Orbio Earth?\\nWe are open to any connections!Find us on Linkedin, Crunchbase and Twitter, or drop us a line on info@orbio.earth, we are always keen on talking to people who are interested in tackling the methane problem.\\nWhy are current methane emission estimates so inaccurate\\n**Because estimating methane emissions is very difficult!** There are three main reasons for this:1. The nature of events are quite random, it can be from a leaking valve to a maintenance event, to a blowout.2. There are 12 million energy assets worldwide that can emit methane. Therefore it's difficult to capture accurate data about emissions across such large scales.3. Lastly, the majority of methane emissions are un-reported events, therefore, usually, they are not taken into account by current estimates.\\nWhat sort of business risks can methane emissions create\\n**There are three examples that can be pointed to here:** \\u200d1. Regulatory Pressure is increasing - after CO26 and the Global methane pledge, which 100 countries signed, methane regulations are being introduced creating transitional risks for companies. This transitional risk and regulatory pressure is in turn leading to shareholders pressuring businesses to better account for methane in their supply chain.2. Unaccounted methane emissions can lead to drops in company valuations. Diversified energy recently suffered a $300m drop in its share price after it was found to have higher methane emissions in its supply chain than reported.3. Companies are backing out of purchasing decisions based on methane emission risk. Engie recently backed out of an energy deal with NextDecade after fears over the methane emissions within the companies supply chain\\n# Sign up to our newsletter.\\nInterested in hearing updates on the methane space, regulation and Orbio product developments?\\n[Request Demo](https://www.orbio.earth/</demo>)[Sign up here](https://www.orbio.earth/<https:/earth.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0701c1fd7e087cfeb6b711d66&id=972f6b5f22&utm_campaign=Newsletter+Linkedin>)\\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657b6a2140ffd3eaffa11213/657b6a2140ffd3eaffa112bf_orbio-logo.svg)](https://www.orbio.earth/<#>)\\nUnited States1111B S Governors Ave, Dover, DE 19904EuropeGeestemuender Str. 41, 50735 Köln, Germany\\u200d\\ninfo@orbio.earth\\n##### Markets\\n[Oil & Gas Companies](https://www.orbio.earth/</oil-gas-partners>)\\n##### COMPANY\\n[Home](https://www.orbio.earth/</>)[Platform](https://www.orbio.earth/</platform>)[About Us](https://www.orbio.earth/</about>)[Careers](https://www.orbio.earth/</careers>)\\n##### Resources\\n[Articles](https://www.orbio.earth/</articles>)[Research](https://www.orbio.earth/</research>)[News](https://www.orbio.earth/</news>)[Privacy Policy](https://www.orbio.earth/<#>)[Terms & Conditions](https://www.orbio.earth/<#>)\\n[Home](https://www.orbio.earth/</>)[Platform](https://www.orbio.earth/</platform>)[About Us](https://www.orbio.earth/</about>)[Resources![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657b6a2140ffd3eaffa11213/657b6a2140ffd3eaffa11240_chevron-down.svg)](https://www.orbio.earth/<#>)\\nSOLUTIONS\\n[Oil & Gas OperatorsReducing emission risks](https://www.orbio.earth/</oil-gas-partners>)[Private Equity & FinanceUnderstand portfolio exposure ](https://www.orbio.earth/</financial-partners>)\\nArticles\\n[All articles](https://www.orbio.earth/</research>)\\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657b6a2140ffd3eaffa1123a/65e9ed230579c69dc7440c63_656a88048112d26fbcbee180_hills.webp)Methane Emissions -

There are 12 million oil & gas facilities globally capable of emitting methane emissions, and a huge amount go under the radar.Traditional methods fall short in accurately reporting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, leading to a staggering underreporting of up to 70%.⟨15⟩\\u200dAs the world braces for stringent regulations with significant financial repercussions, such as the impending IRA methane fee in the US and forthcoming EU regulation, the immediate need for precision in methane emission benchmarking has never been more critical.\\n##### Our partners and collaborators\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657b6a2140ffd3eaffa11213/657b6a2140ffd3eaffa11242_yc.png)\\n# Frequently asked questions\\nHow does the Orbio Earth platform work?\\nOrbio utilises satellite data to capture images of methane every 4 days from any site on earth. We then reconcile this satellite emissions data with emission factor datasets to provide better emission benchmarks of assets, companies and supply chains.\\nWhy is understanding methane emissions important?\\nReducing man-made methane emissions are a win for both the climate and companies in the energy and financial sectors. Stopping these emissions from the energy industry alone could prevent 0.2°C of global warming.To put that into perspective, it would be like taking all cars and trucks off the road globally. Preventing these emissions are surprisingly simple when stakeholders are equipped with the right data.\\nHow is Orbio Earth different?\\nFirstly Orbio can deliver data at high spatial resolutions meaning emissions can be attributed to specific assets. The main methane-specific satellite in use today gives regional scale resolutions making it very difficult to gauge where the source of methane emissions are coming from.Secondly, Orbio has begun reconciling emissions data with non-emission datasets to inform how existing reporting efforts and aid with risk identification.\\nHow can I get involved with Orbio Earth?\\nWe are open to any connections!Find us on Linkedin, Crunchbase and Twitter, or drop us a line on info@orbio.earth, we are always keen on talking to people who are interested in tackling the methane problem.\\nWhy are current methane emission estimates so inaccurate\\n**Because estimating methane emissions is very difficult!** There are three main reasons for this:1. The nature of events are quite random, it can be from a leaking valve to a maintenance event, to a blowout.2. There are 12 million energy assets worldwide that can emit methane. Therefore it's difficult to capture accurate data about emissions across such large scales.3. Lastly, the majority of methane emissions are un-reported events, therefore, usually, they are not taken into account by current estimates.\\nWhat sort of business risks can methane emissions create\\n**There are three examples that can be pointed to here:** \\u200d1. Regulatory Pressure is increasing - after CO26 and the Global methane pledge, which 100 countries signed, methane regulations are being introduced creating transitional risks for companies. This transitional risk and regulatory pressure is in turn leading to shareholders pressuring businesses to better account for methane in their supply chain.2. Unaccounted methane emissions can lead to drops in company valuations. Diversified energy recently suffered a $300m drop in its share price after it was found to have higher methane emissions in its supply chain than reported.3. Companies are backing out of purchasing decisions based on methane emission risk. Engie recently backed out of an energy deal with NextDecade after fears over the methane emissions within the companies supply chain\\n# Sign up to our newsletter.\\nInterested in hearing updates on the methane space, regulation and Orbio product developments?\\nRequest Demo⟨11⟩Sign up here⟨16⟩\\n![⟨12⟩](https://www.orbio.earth/<#>)\\nUnited States1111B S Governors Ave, Dover, DE 19904EuropeGeestemuender Str. 41, 50735 Köln, Germany\\u200d\\ninfo@orbio.earth\\n##### Markets\\nOil & Gas Companies⟨5⟩\\n##### COMPANY\\nHome⟨1⟩Platform⟨2⟩About Us⟨3⟩Careers⟨17⟩\\n##### Resources\\nArticles⟨18⟩Research⟨7⟩News⟨9⟩Privacy Policy⟨19⟩Terms & Conditions⟨19⟩\\nHome⟨1⟩Platform⟨2⟩About Us⟨3⟩Resources![⟨4⟩](https://www.orbio.earth/<#>)\\nSOLUTIONS\\nOil & Gas OperatorsReducing emission risks⟨5⟩Private Equity & FinanceUnderstand portfolio exposure ⟨6⟩\\nArticles\\nAll articles⟨7⟩\\n![⟨8⟩Methane Emissions -

  "generated_description": "### Orbio Earth: Pioneering Methane Emission Tracking\n\n**Founding Mission**  \nOrbio Earth launched in 2021 with a clear mission: to track methane emissions from the oil and gas industry using satellite technology. This initiative seeks to redefine how emissions data is reported and utilized, particularly as the world faces increasing regulatory pressure.\n\n**The Problem**  \nTraditionally, oil and gas companies have relied on outdated, excel-based emission factors that often underestimate methane emissions by around 70%. This lack of accurate data hinders financial companies from making informed investments or understanding the risks associated with new regulations—especially with a wave of new rules looming on the horizon.\n\n**The Solution**  \nOrbio has developed cutting-edge technology that uses satellite imagery to monitor methane emissions from every oil and gas facility globally. This capability, recognized as the most accurate in a peer-reviewed Stanford University study, allows companies to replace outdated methods and make data-driven decisions about their investments. By providing detailed asset-level insights, Orbio empowers financial firms and operators to prioritize emission reduction opportunities and stay ahead of compliance demands.\n\n**Key Achievements**  \n- **Industry Recognition**: In summer 2023, Orbio's satellite-based technology was ranked #1 for accuracy and sensitivity in tracking methane emissions, outperforming established competitors like Maxar.\n- **Financial Backing**: Orbio recently secured $4 million in a funding round to enhance its mission of global methane emissions reduction.\n\n**Market Focus**  \nOrbio serves two primary markets:\n1. **Oil and Gas Operators**: Aiding them in reducing emission risks and managing compliance.\n2. **Private Equity and Financial Companies**: Helping them understand portfolio exposure to methane emissions and navigate regulatory landscapes effectively.\n\n**Why Choose Orbio?**  \nOrbio stands out because of its high-resolution data, which allows for precise attribution of emissions to specific assets, a step beyond what current methane-monitoring satellites provide. This granularity is crucial for tackling the complexities of methane emissions, which are often random and widespread.\n\n**The Team**  \nHeadquartered remotely and part of Y Combinator Batch S23, Orbio operates with a lean team of 14. Their strategic partnerships and collaborations enhance their technological capabilities and market reach.\n\n**In Summary**  \nOrbio Earth isn’t just changing how methane emissions are tracked; they’re enabling a proactive approach to climate impact and risk management in the energy sector. As regulations tighten, those who can leverage precise emissions data will have a competitive edge in navigating the evolving landscape.
