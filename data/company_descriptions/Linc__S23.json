The company, located in an undisclosed area with a team of just 3 employees, develops automation tools that reduce manual data entry and streamline workflows in logistics.\n\n**Product Offering**  \nLinc's flagship product is an AI agent designed to parse various forms of inbound data—emails, documents, and spreadsheets—and synchronize this information with existing systems of record like ERPs and spreadsheets. This means logistics professionals can spend less time on tedious data entry and more time focusing on growth and operational efficiency.\n\nHere are some key features:  \n- **Eliminate Manual Data Entry**: Instantly extract data from documents and email and sync it with your existing systems.\n- **User-Friendly API**: Users can upload files, define data schemas, and see results in real-time.\n- **Support for Various Document Types**: Whether it’s transport management documents or safety compliance forms, Linc is built to handle it all.\n\n**Impact**  \nBy automating 0-10% of data entry tasks, Linc claims to help users regain 0-7 hours per day, significantly reduce operating costs, and improve data quality. This kind of efficiency is not just a nice-to-have; it’s essential in today’s fast-paced logistics environment.\n\n**Contact and Further Learning**  \nIf you’re intrigued by what Linc offers and keen on a live demo, you can check out their website [here](https://www.linc-ai.com/) or reach out via email at founders@linc-ai.com.

Their focus on automation isn’t just about keeping up with the industry; it’s about setting a new standard for what efficient logistics can and should look like.
