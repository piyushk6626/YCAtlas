As your data team answers questions through playbooks, Kater automatically builds a shared **data model** which serves as the source of truth for your business metrics and semantics. This data model is version-controlled and follows SWE best practices. The data model enables business experts to ask personalized follow-up questions from the playbooks using plain English. Give anyone the power to answer and unblock their personal data requests.\\nHow much does Kater cost?\\nWe support free trials, with annual contracts determined by the size and complexity of your data and company. Contact us for more details.\\nWhat data warehouses do you integrate with?\\nYou can connect with Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, and MS-SQL. If you have a warehouse not on this list, we can build a custom connector for you in ~1 day.\\nHow long does it take to set up?\\nSet up takes as quick as 15 minutes, and we provide white-glove onboarding and concierge services. We've meticulously designed Kater to be interoperable with your existing data stack and extremely simple to onboard, so you can start seeing value immediately.\\nHow will Kater use my data?\\nWe take data privacy very seriously. Kater does not store any of your data in our application database, nor do we use your data to train any LLM. Everything is stored locally in your browser's cache. \\nDoes Kater use AI to write SQL?\\nKater only uses AI to help your data members write SQL as they build the Playbooks, ensuring that a human is still in the loop. Kater does **not** use AI to write SQL for non-technical users; it uses the defined YAML data model files instead. This ensures the highest accuracy in SQL results, as we found that using GenAI to generate SQL is not sufficient for business critical functions.\\nI have more questions.

As your data team answers questions through playbooks, Kater automatically builds a shared **data model** which serves as the source of truth for your business metrics and semantics. This data model is version-controlled and follows SWE best practices. The data model enables business experts to ask personalized follow-up questions from the playbooks using plain English. Give anyone the power to answer and unblock their personal data requests.\\nHow much does Kater cost?\\nWe support free trials, with annual contracts determined by the size and complexity of your data and company. Contact us for more details.\\nWhat data warehouses do you integrate with?\\nYou can connect with Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, and MS-SQL. If you have a warehouse not on this list, we can build a custom connector for you in ~1 day.\\nHow long does it take to set up?\\nSet up takes as quick as 15 minutes, and we provide white-glove onboarding and concierge services. We've meticulously designed Kater to be interoperable with your existing data stack and extremely simple to onboard, so you can start seeing value immediately.\\nHow will Kater use my data?\\nWe take data privacy very seriously. Kater does not store any of your data in our application database, nor do we use your data to train any LLM. Everything is stored locally in your browser's cache. \\nDoes Kater use AI to write SQL?\\nKater only uses AI to help your data members write SQL as they build the Playbooks, ensuring that a human is still in the loop. Kater does **not** use AI to write SQL for non-technical users; it uses the defined YAML data model files instead. This ensures the highest accuracy in SQL results, as we found that using GenAI to generate SQL is not sufficient for business critical functions.\\nI have more questions.

  "generated_description": "**Kater.ai: Simplifying Data Analysis for Everyone**\n\nKater.ai was founded in 2023 and is a promising newcomer in the world of data analytics, currently part of Y Combinator's Batch W24. Based in San Francisco, it aims to revolutionize how businesses approach data through a straightforward yet powerful mission: delivering complete data analysis from just a single question.\n\nThe process Kater.ai employs is quite innovative. It starts with users articulating their data-related issues. Then, Kater identifies the essential questions that need to be answered, generates the necessary code, and ultimately delivers insights in seconds instead of weeks. This is a game-changer in the often tedious and slow-moving realm of enterprise analytics.\n\nKater's unique selling point is its continuous classification engine, which transforms a userâ€™s single inquiry into a customized series of questions tailored to their specific needs. This empowers usersâ€”especially those who may not be data scientistsâ€”to become expert analysts, leveraging trusted data relevant to their specific roles or personas. It effectively eliminates the bottleneck of relying on dedicated data analysts, reducing time spent on analysis misfires and rework.\n\nThe founding team boasts impressive credentials, with Yvonne, a former data engineer and analyst who built the entire data stack at CREXi, and Robin, who led engineering at Microsoft. Their collective expertise shapes Kater into a robust platform that helps organizations transition from being data-rich but insight-poor to insight-rich.\n\nKater also focuses on data storytelling, automating responses to data questions, outlining next steps, and generating weekly reports filled with actionable insights. Features like *Data Playbooks*, 'Butler AI', and a unified data model enable users to engage with data in a more conversational and instinctive way, further democratizing data access.\n\nSecurity remains a top priority as wellâ€”the company is working towards SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and ensures data privacy through robust encryption protocols.\n\nFor those eager to explore the future of data, Kater.ai simplifies analytics, allowing teams to set it up in about 15 minutes and offering a free trial for potential customers. The platform integrates seamlessly with popular data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift, making it an attractive option for businesses looking to enhance their data-driven decision-making processes.\n\nIn summary, Kater.ai is not just another analytics tool; it's a transformative approach to how businesses interact with and derive insights from their data. If youâ€™re ready to empower your team to tap into the potential of data easily and intuitively, Kater.ai could be your next big step. Check them out at [Kater.ai](https://www.kater.ai)."
