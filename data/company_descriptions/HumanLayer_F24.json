One customer uses HumanLayer to ship DevOps agents that manage complex and risky workflows like production deployments and database migrations. \r\n\nWe’re building HumanLayer because we know that the future of AI Applications is not gonna be humans sitting at a chat interface, the future is “outer loop” or “headless” agents, and our partners are building AI apps that invert the typical interaction paradigm. Autonomous agents are calling humans, not the other way around.\r\n\nAI Agents are poised to disrupt the $4.6tn global labor market, but in order to make agents reliable today, and train them to be fully autonomous tomorrow, solutions like HumanLayer are an inevitable part of the AI Agent stack.",

Core improvements to developer experience for Replicated.\n\nI stumbled on the Human-in-the-Loop-for-AI problem while building slack-based agents that managed SQL warehouses. In 3 weeks I pivoted to HumanLayer and launched an MVP",

  "generated_description": "**HumanLayer: Integrating Humans into AI Workflows**\n\nFounded in 2023, HumanLayer is an innovative startup that's pushing the boundaries of how AI can collaborate with humans. Currently part of Y Combinator's Batch F24, they’ve developed a robust API and SDK that allows AI applications to contact humans for essential feedback, input, and approvals—what they call a \"Human-in-the-Loop\" system.\n\n### Mission\n\nHumanLayer's mission is crystal clear: they aim to make AI agents more reliable today and fully autonomous tomorrow by bridging the gap between humans and machines. As they envision it, the future of AI won't be about humans initiating interactions through a chat interface—instead, it will be about autonomous agents reaching out to humans for guidance when needed. This paradigm shift is vital, especially as AI agents start to challenge the enormous $4.6 trillion global labor market.\n\n### What They Do\n\nAt its core, HumanLayer is designed for those who need robust oversight in their AI processes. One of their clients leverages HumanLayer to ship DevOps agents critical for managing complex tasks, such as database migrations and production deployments. They offer essential features like:\n\n- **Human Approval for Function Calls**: Certain actions in AI functionality can be held for human approval.
