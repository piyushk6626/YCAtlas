  "generated_description": "**Freestyle: Simplifying Infrastructure with JavaScript**\n\nFreestyle is an ambitious startup founded in early 2024 by Ben and Jacob, two high school friends who stumbled upon the world of tech during a Calculus class. Their journey in entrepreneurship began back then, and although their first attempt went nowhere, it laid the groundwork for their future endeavors. Fast forward, Ben led the frontend development of the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 app while Jacob later joined Apple, eventually inviting Ben to the tech giant as well. They spent a productive two years at Apple’s Conversational Engineering Department, learning valuable lessons from the tech they worked with, which ultimately sparked the inspiration for Freestyle.\n\nLocated in San Francisco and part of the Y Combinator Batch S24, Freestyle is on a mission to build exceptional infrastructure using only JavaScript. This small yet driven team of five aims to empower developers by leveraging native JavaScript APIs to streamline web development. With a clear focus on enhancing developer tools, Freestyle challenges the typical reliance on multiple external services for functionalities like database management and authentication.\n\nFreestyle introduces a concept that they call \"TypeScript is the Database,\" allowing developers to structure their applications with simplicity and elegance. By using the @cloudstate decorator, properties of classes can be persistently stored and accessible across any request, paving the way for efficient coding and deployment.\n\nWhat makes Freestyle truly stand out is its commitment to open-source collaboration. Rather than introducing opinionated APIs that complicate development, they leverage existing ECMAScript standards, empowering developers to use what they already know. This enables them to replace external services—like Auth0 or traditional database systems—with versatile, built-in APIs that are easy to use and integrate.\n\nIn a world brimming with boilerplate code and cloud complexities, Freestyle offers a refreshing alternative: \"Deploy your entire stack in 1 command.\" By prioritizing native TypeScript APIs, developers can focus on business logic without getting bogged down by infrastructure concerns. \n\nIf you're curious about their offerings, you can dive into their documentation, join their community on Discord, or even explore their open-source projects on GitHub. Freestyle is positioning itself as a leading edge in developer tools—a place where your JavaScript skills can truly shine.\n\nFor more information, check out [Freestyle's website](https://www.freestyle.sh) and discover how they are revolutionizing the way developers build applications."
