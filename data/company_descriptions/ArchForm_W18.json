  "generated_description": "**ArchForm: Revolutionizing Orthodontics**\n\nArchForm is a visionary startup that aims to replace traditional orthodontic braces with modern clear aligners and cutting-edge software. Founded in Sunnyvale, CA, and a part of Y Combinator’s W18 batch, ArchForm helps orthodontists design, create, and 3D print aligners on-site, making them competitive against direct-to-consumer alternatives like Invisalign.\n\n### What They Do\n\nArchForm equips orthodontists with a software platform that streamlines the aligner creation process. They offer several key features that transform orthodontic practices:\n\n- **Rapid Treatment Planning**: Orthodontists can set up treatments in just 10 minutes, automating tedious tasks like trimming and aligning designs.\n- **Same-Day Starts**: With in-office 3D printing, patients can receive aligners or bonding trays in as little as half an hour—exceeding patient expectations.\n- **Cost Reduction**: ArchForm claims to cut aligner costs by over 50%, allowing practices to enhance profitability and efficiency while passing savings to patients.\n\n### Product Offerings\n\n1. **3D Design Software**: Empower orthodontists to customize treatment plans, providing more control over patient care.\n2. **Factory-Made and In-Office Aligners**: A flexible approach allows practices to choose between ready-made aligners or producing aligners in-house for immediate treatments.\n3. **Direct Print Technology**: This feature utilizes shape-memory materials to create aligners directly in the office.\n\n### The Team\n\nWith a team of 23 talented individuals, ArchForm is robustly positioned to lead the digital orthodontics space. Their goal isn’t just about technology; it’s about enhancing patient outcomes and practice efficiency.\n\n### Impact\n\nArchForm has generated over $300 million in savings for its customers across 7 million aligners produced, underscoring the platform’s significant influence on the orthodontic field.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nIn a world where patient expectations are evolving, ArchForm is redefining what’s possible in orthodontics. Their innovative solutions not only streamline operations but also empower professionals to provide better care, improve patient satisfaction, and grow their practices.\n\nFor more information, visit [ArchForm](http://archform.com).\n\nBuckle up, because with ArchForm, the future of orthodontics is here—and it’s clear."
