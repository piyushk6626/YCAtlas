From 50 employees to half a million employees; from sales people to Fortune-500 CEOs. Our four main customer segments are:\\n• Fortune-500 enterprises where we serve global executive management teams and other senior leaders (+20 000 FTEs)\\n• Professional services firms, where we typically serve all employees from assistants to senior partners (100 FTEs to 600 000 FTEs)\\n• Private Equity firms, where we typically serve all employees, from assistants to partners (150-2000 FTEs)\\n• Sales teams in any sized company\\n• Other critical human capital, e.g. software engineering teams, R&D teams\\n#### The performance coaches\\n**Are the coaches employed by PeakPath?**\\nYes. All our coaches are employed by us. We attract and develop the best coaches by giving them a stable platform and they love being a part of building our company.\\n**What backgrounds do the coaches have?**\\nAll PeakPath’s coaches are certified by the International Coaching Federation (ICF). They have at least an Associate Certified Coach (ACC) and often a Professional Certified Coach (PCC) certification. Our coaches have worked in a high-performance setting, e.g. been a leader in business, or worked in professional services, banking, etc. All our coaches have a deep interest in performance and health improvement. At PeakPath we train our coaches extensively in how to use data to improve performance and resilience.\\n#### Implementation\\n**If I say yes, what are the next steps?**\\n• Inviting all eligible employees to an information session where they learn about how to build physical and mental foundations for performance and are able to opt in to support from PeakPath with a coach and smart ring.These sessions are done in person on your premises if your employees are co-located. Otherwise they are done online and wearables are shipped to each office afterwards.\\n• Meeting with PeakPath to help us understand what employee support programs you already have in place so that our coaches can sign-post effectively.\\n• Book in a sequence of bi-monthly learning sessions for the group of participants. In these sessions they get feedback on how they develop as a group and are able to share their experiences with each other. The sessions are facilitated by PeakPath.\\n**What are the time commitments for me as a CHRO / sponsor of the collaboration?**\\n• In the first month, 2 hours to give PeakPath context about your organisation\\'s goals and resources that are available to employees, and also to participate in the onboarding session together with all employees.\\n• After the first month, set off 1 hour of time for bi-monthly group progress updates and feedback meetings.\\n**What are the time commitments required for a member/user?**\\nEach member tailors their journey with PeakPath entirely together with the coach. On average, our members meet their coach once every month for 30-60 minutes and chat once per week.\\n#### Integration and Technology\\n**How does the platform integrate with other common technologies used within an organisation?**\\nAs part of the customer onboarding we will interview you regarding the full range of support you offer to your employees, e.g. health insurance. Our coaches will use this information to steer your employees to relevant resources when needed.\\n**Most of our leaders do not use wearables. How does your program address this?**\\nAs part of the user onboarding, we will equip each member with a fitted wearable device.\\n#### Wearable Device\\n**What type of wearable device is used?**\\nPeakPath works with Oura, Garmin and Apple Watch. Together with each customer we decide what wearable to offer to employees who do not use a wearable today.\\n**What metrics does it measure, and how easy is it for users to wear and adapt to?**\\nAll devices we integrate with collect information on sleep, activity, and stress levels to get a broad understanding of your wellbeing. If we take the Oura ring for example, it measures your overall readiness to perform, your wellbeing, your sleep duration and sleep quality, your stress level, your recovery and your activity level.\\n**How easy is the product to wear?**\\nEasy, since we use consumer wearables that are made for daily use. The most discreet option is the Oura ring: most people forget that they are wearing it within one or two days.\\n#### Data Handling and Privacy\\n**What do employees feel about sharing biometric wearable data?**\\nAfter the introduction of how PeakPath works with individual data, there are rarely any concerns. Which is why we have an 80% adoption rate.\\n**Who is the data shared with?**\\nThe only ones who can see an individual member’s data are the member’s coach, senior engineers and data scientists who process the information. No one else at PeakPath nor the employer have access to individual, non-anonymised health data.\\n**What about GDPR compliance?**\\nPeakPath is GDPR compliant, which has been validated given our several Fortune-500 companies that have done due-diligence on the company. The data privacy agreement is signed between the member and PeakPath. No data privacy agreement is needed between PeakPath and the employer since no private identifiable data is shared between PeakPath and the employer.\\n**What are the legal ramifications of tracking and sharing this information within an organisation?**\\nNone, since no individual data is shared with the employer.\\n**How is the collected data stored, managed, and utilized for reporting, and what are the measures in place to ensure data privacy and security?**\\n• Wearable data shared with us by our members are used to populate the members app with insight, to bring wearable data insights to coaching conversations, and to generate aggregated team- and company-level insights.\\n• Only anonymised, aggregated health data is shared with persons other than your coach and a small group of senior engineers and data scientists who are trusted to handle personally identifiable health data.\\n• We are ISO-27001 certified. To safeguard the sensitive data shared with us, we have information security management policies in place.\\n• All PeakPath employees undergo annual IT security training.\\n#### Performance and Impact\\n**What is the adoption rate?**\\nThe adoption rate is on average 80%. The adoption rate is higher when it is launched on a team-level, then we often see 90-100% adoption rate.\\n**What is the retention rate?**\\nAfter six months, 93% continue using PeakPath.\\n**What are the expected outcomes of the program for the company?**\\nThe first order of benefit is that we build new habits. Those new habits have a significant increase on mental wellbeing. We use a scale called WHO-5 which is the world’s most validated scale for mental wellbeing. In six months, on average we increase the share of employees in “very high mental wellbeing” from 7% to 25%; we reduce the group with “very low mental wellbeing” from 23% to 8%.\\n**What outcomes can I expect from participating as a member/user?**\\nYou already know what things you would want to start doing or stop doing; things you would want to do more of, or less of. With PeakPath you will implement those things in your life. Those new habits will likely have a positive impact on your physiology and your self-assessed mental wellbeing. In practice, PeakPath has an effect on outcomes such as the frequency with which you wake up refreshed and rested, feel active and vigorous etc.\\nPerformance coaching powered by biometric data from wearables.\\n**Company**\\n[About](https://www.lifted.work/<https:/peakpath.com/about>)\\n[Careers](https://www.lifted.work/<https:/peakpath.teamtailor.com/>)\\n**Visit us**\\nNorrsken\\nBirger Jarlsgatan 57C\\n113 56 Stockholm\\n**Contact**\\ninfo@peakpath.com\\n[![Image](https://assets.cdn.filesafe.space/AdYBRubYRiKkRA7jYj8v/media/654ed1ebf4fe3f917c7978ba.png)](https://www.lifted.work/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/peakpaths>)\\n[PeakPath](https://www.lifted.work/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/peakpaths>)\\n© 2023 PeakPath.

  "generated_description": "### Lifted: Revolutionizing Workplace Health and Performance\n\nFounded in 2021 and originally known as NudgeLabs, Lifted is making waves in the realm of workplace wellness. Nestled in Stockholm, Sweden, this innovative company has a mission: to enhance team performance and employee retention through smart, wearable technology combined with professional coaching. They became a part of Y Combinator's Batch W22, which attests to their potential to disrupt the market.\n\n#### The Concept\n\nLifted leverages data from smartwatches to underpin their coaching services. Imagine each team member paired with a personal coach who not only provides motivation but also tailors strategies based on biometric data—like sleep quality, stress levels, and overall activity. This holistic approach isn't just about pushing employees harder; it's about fostering a more sustainable, healthy work environment where individuals can thrive both mentally and physically. \n\nThe company's current offerings—dubbed PeakPath—focus on personalized coaching, stress management, and better sleep, all powered by insights from wearables. Whether it’s helping consultants enhance their performance through improved sleep or reducing workplace stress, Lifted is tackling a fundamental issue: productivity 101 relies on health 101.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nHere's a simplified breakdown of their process:\n\n1. **Assessment**: Employees complete a self-assessment and wear an Oura ring to gather data about their health.\n2. **Personal Coaching**: After review, an assigned coach collaborates with each employee to devise a personalized plan targeting sleep and stress management.\n3. **Tracking Progress**: Employees use an app to track their habits, gaining insights into how daily choices impact their wellbeing.\n4. **Ongoing Support**: Coaches check in weekly, helping employees stay aligned with their wellness goals.\n\nThis method proves effective. Lifted boasts an impressive adoption rate—80% on average, with some teams reaching nearly 100%. Retention after six months is high, at 93%.\n\n#### Achievements and Future Outlook\n\nLifted’s commitment to enhancing mental health has pegged it as a key player in the mental health tech sector, appealing to a variety of organizations—from Fortune 500 companies to private equity firms. Their approach is not just anecdotal; metrics show a substantial increase in employees’ mental wellbeing, with those reporting \"very high mental wellbeing\" rising from 7% to 25% in just six months.\n\nWith a dedicated team of nine and acted upon the governance of partners like Gustaf Alstromer, Lifted is poised to grow rapidly. They are not just offering coaching; they are fostering cultures that prioritize health at work, making them necessary stakeholders in the new age of employment.\n\nIn sum, Lifted is proving that the future of work shouldn’t just revolve around grind culture; it should focus on balance, health, and sustainable performance. Discover more about them at [Lifted’s website](https://www.lifted.work)."
