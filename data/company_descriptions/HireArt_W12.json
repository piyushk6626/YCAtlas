  "generated_description": "**HireArt: Redefining Contract Workforce Management**\n\nFounded in 2012 and originally known as Hire Smarter, HireArt has evolved into a modern staffing agency that specializes in connecting businesses with W2 contractors. Situated in New York and part of the Y Combinator W12 batch, HireArt operates with a clear mission: to provide companies everything they need to hire and manage their contractor workforce efficiently.\n\nAt the heart of HireArt's approach is a commitment to transparency and empathy. The company believes that effective hiring should involve more than just a resumé. They use innovative methods like work samples and video assessments to evaluate candidates, ensuring a deeper insight into culture fit, experience, and communication skills. This approach has proven successful, with their candidates finding roles at prominent companies such as Facebook, Airbnb, and Waymo.\n\nHireArt employs a dedicated team of 90 professionals who assess candidates to ensure the right match for the right company. Their key offerings include:\n\n- **Vendor Management:** A robust system to manage suppliers.\n- **Employer of Record:** A modern solution for the employment complexities facing today’s workforce.\n- **Program Management:** Comprehensive management of contract workforce programs.\n- **Sourcing & Recruitment:** Streamlined tools to fill contract roles efficiently.\n- **Worker Classification and Compliance:** Robust features to minimize classification risks and ensure compliance with employment laws.\n\nThe company's innovative platform caters to various stakeholders, including HR leaders, hiring managers, procurement teams, and talent acquisition specialists. They focus on understanding the unique needs of each group, allowing for tailored solutions that boost operational efficiency.\n\nHireArt's impact is evident through its impressive net promoter scores—77.3 for contractors and 86.4 for clients, which starkly contrasts with traditional staffing service averages. Their case studies illustrate significant successes, like helping Zoox consolidate 88 contract workers under a single employer of record while maintaining a 90% retention rate.\n\nIn a world where the nature of work is rapidly changing, HireArt stands out by putting people first. Their platform not only simplifies the complex hiring landscape but also fosters an environment where both contractors and employers can thrive.\n\nFor more details about their services or to see how HireArt can assist your organization, visit their website: [HireArt.com](http://hireart.com)."
