The rate shown is subject to price fluctuation and is net of fees. T-bills are purchased at a discount to par (par= $1,000), with the price being subject to market fluctuation. The amount of T-Bills available at a particular yield will depend upon the sellers’ offer size; any remaining cash balance after the purchase may not earn the same yield. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed income securities also carry other risks, including inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties.[2]Yield as of [08/21/24]. The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous 7 days. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of a money market fund carefully before investing. This and other information is found in the fund’s prospectus. Please read the prospectus before investing. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Yields fluctuate and past performance is no guarantee of future results. [3] Atomic Invest LLC (“Atomic”), through a clearing relationship with Pershing LLC (“Pershing”) offers a cash sweep program. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are generally not FDIC-insured. The Sweep Program is administered by Pershing, LLC. Deposits at each Program Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity. Based on eligibility criteria, the two FDIC-insured programs (“Bank Deposit Programs”) offered are 1) [Dreyfus Insured Deposits (DIDI)](https://every.io/<https:/www.dreyfus.com/sitelets/insured-deposits/dreyfus-insured-deposit-program-i-didi.html>) and 2) [Liquid Insured Deposits](https://every.io/<https:/www.pershing.com/us/en/rates.html>). Funds deposited into each sweep program, in aggregate, are eligible for up to $2,500,000 of FDIC insurance. The sweep programs can be configured so that once the funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity at up to ten Program Banks), then the next Bank Deposit Program is initiated. Although certain types of accounts, such as trust accounts may be eligible for additional FDIC insurance based on the number of beneficiaries, funds will be allocated to each Program Bank in such a way that provides up to $250,000 of FDIC insurance for individual accounts and $250,000 of FDIC insurance for trust and other corporate account types, in each case per Program Bank. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance available through the Atomic Invest account may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank, including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of the Atomic Invest account, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not protected by SIPC.

The rate shown is subject to price fluctuation and is net of fees. T-bills are purchased at a discount to par (par= $1,000), with the price being subject to market fluctuation. The amount of T-Bills available at a particular yield will depend upon the sellers’ offer size; any remaining cash balance after the purchase may not earn the same yield. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed income securities also carry other risks, including inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties.[2]Yield as of [08/21/24]. The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous 7 days. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of a money market fund carefully before investing. This and other information is found in the fund’s prospectus. Please read the prospectus before investing. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Yields fluctuate and past performance is no guarantee of future results. [3] Atomic Invest LLC (“Atomic”), through a clearing relationship with Pershing LLC (“Pershing”) offers a cash sweep program. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are generally not FDIC-insured. The Sweep Program is administered by Pershing, LLC. Deposits at each Program Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity. Based on eligibility criteria, the two FDIC-insured programs (“Bank Deposit Programs”) offered are 1) Dreyfus Insured Deposits (DIDI)⟨34⟩ and 2) Liquid Insured Deposits⟨35⟩. Funds deposited into each sweep program, in aggregate, are eligible for up to $2,500,000 of FDIC insurance. The sweep programs can be configured so that once the funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity at up to ten Program Banks), then the next Bank Deposit Program is initiated. Although certain types of accounts, such as trust accounts may be eligible for additional FDIC insurance based on the number of beneficiaries, funds will be allocated to each Program Bank in such a way that provides up to $250,000 of FDIC insurance for individual accounts and $250,000 of FDIC insurance for trust and other corporate account types, in each case per Program Bank. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance available through the Atomic Invest account may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank, including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of the Atomic Invest account, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not protected by SIPC.
