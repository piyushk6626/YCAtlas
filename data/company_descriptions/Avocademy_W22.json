It\\'s not easy, but it is doable!\\n“The community and mentors created a space where I felt understood and supported from start to finish. DO IT! It\\'s not easy, but it is doable, especially when you have the Avocademy community on your side. I work remotely in a career I love! A job that allows me to have the work/life balance and salary I dreamed of.”\\nAlexandra Rovait\\nFormer Sommelier\\n#### After completing the program, I discovered my passion...\\n“Before Avocademy, I was dissatisfied with my previous job and felt unfulfilled. However, after completing the program, I discovered my passion for UX/UI Design and the opportunity to make a real impact by creating user-friendly experiences. This career change not only brought job satisfaction but also a sense of purpose in helping people through design.”\\nElena Ispas\\nFormer Dental Assistant\\n#### In my past jobs, I always felt there was something missing\\n“Before Avocademy, I had never even heard of UX/UI design. In my past jobs, I always felt there was something missing. As a UX/UI designer, I feel at home. I never imagined I would find a job that checks all of my boxes. I would not have been successful in making this career change without the proper skills, knowledge, and guidance, and that is exactly what you get when you join Avocademy.”\\nVeronica Taylor\\nFormer Teacher\\n#### Even after securing a job, I continue to feel the support of Avocademy\\nI love the community that Avocademy fosters and the support that they provide. Even after securing a job, I continue to feel the support of Avocademy and am still in contact with designers I\\'ve met along the way. The staff, mentors, and students are incredibly helpful and encouraging.\\nBrynn Rogowski\\nFormer Barista\\n#### Having access to mentors that are working as professional UX designers was essential!\\nI am someone who always asks a million questions, so having access to mentors that are working as professional UX designers was essential! They were able to answer my questions and give insight into the industry.\\nLauren Meyer\\nFormer Graphic Designer\\n#### Avocademy helped me break myself out of poverty\\nI am finally able to achieve my dream career thanks to Avocademy. I am the first woman in my family in tech. Avocademy helped me break myself out of poverty and open doors for BIPOC women like me.\\nSamiya Hossain\\nFormer Underwriter\\n#### I absolutely loved being able to speak with a mentor throughout the entire process!\\nI would highly recommend taking the UX/UI Foundations course if you are considering a career change! I absolutely loved being able to speak with a mentor throughout the entire process. From questions about design to strategizing for interviews, they were there for me! After completing this course, I was certain that UX/UI design was a great fit for me which led me to enrolling in Career Jumpstart.\\nMegan Crowley\\nFormer Fiber Artist\\n#### I gained a new sense of confidence within myself\\nI gained a new sense of confidence within myself. I stepped out of my comfort zone to enroll into Avocademy and once completing UX/UI Foundations, I feel comfortable in my ability to learn new skills and to adapt into new environments. It was pretty cool to see all the hard work from researching, interviewing, mapping and wire-framing come together into a digital product!\\nRakim Tyler\\nFormer Chemist\\n#### It\\'s a balanced choice for UX/UI design education\\nAvocademy offers affordability without skimping on value. With features like unlimited mentorship, portfolio projects, and ongoing support for job hunting and real-world client collaborations, it\\'s a balanced choice for UX/UI design education.\\nAaron Henderson\\nFormer Computer Technician\\n#### I always felt like my career was lacking something\\nI have a background in business, education, and psychology, but I always felt like my career was lacking something. Then, I discovered UX design, which combines all three of my interests, and I knew it was the right fit for me. Avocademy was instrumental in reshaping my career, and now, I\\'ve never been happier and more fulfilled in my work.\\nNoureen Khan\\nFormer Educator\\n#### I thought I lost my chance to be a designer because I hadn\\'t majored in it\\nIf you think it\\'s too late for you, it\\'s not. Time will pass regardless so why not pursue something you really want? I thought I lost my chance to be a designer because I hadn\\'t majored in it. I happened upon UX Design and a couple months later invested in Avocademy. Now I\\'m starting a full-time design role and I couldn\\'t be happier. Thank you to Maca and the mentors who have made this course possible and so valuable.\\nMaria Kravetz\\nFormer Receptionist\\n#### These courses fully prepared me for work in this industry\\nI came in knowing almost nothing about UX/UI Design, and through these courses was able to advance my knowledge and gain real world experience working on projects as a sole designer, a designer on a team of 6, and a lead designer with direct interactions with my client. These courses fully prepared me for work in this industry and helped me land a job two months into my job search!\\nBecca Tupaj\\nFormer Catering Director\\nSee More\\n## Your next career move, guaranteed\\nWe know how important this transition is to you and we will do everything we can to help you succeed and land your next UX role. \\n[Enroll in the UX/UI Design Career Accelerator](http://www.Avocademy.com/</products/ux-ui-design-career-accelerator>)\\n#### Understanding Product Design for AI\\nPersonalized mentorship from industry experts\\nUse those skills to be career- ready by day 1\\n#### Hands-On Experience Creating AI Products\\nGet experience that gets you hired\\nFeel empowered to transform your career\\n#### Get Job-Ready for AI-Focused Roles\\nLand a job faster and more efficiently than ever\\nGet warm introductions to hiring partners and recruiters\\n## Ready to Sign Up?\\nOur UX/UI Design Career Accelerator program is the first step into a high-paying career.\\n  * Learn UX Research, UX Design, UI Design\\nWe provide a comprehensive introduction to UX so you have solid foundation. \\n  * Start Building Your Portfolio\\nThroughout the program you’ll work on a project that you’ll be able to showcase in your portfolio. \\n  * Unlimited Projects\\nWe have mentors across different time zones, so you’ll always have someone to rely on. \\n  * Resume Help\\nWe’ll give you guidance so you can update your resume with all the skills you learned in the program. \\n  * Financing Options\\nWith Affirm you can access payment plans stating at $154/month with 6, 12, 24, 36 month options * \\n\\n\\n### UX/UI Design Career Accelerator program\\nSpend 8 to 16 weeks learning the Foundations of UX Design in a structured and accessible learning environment. \\n  * Program $4,500\\n  * Discount* -$500\\n*Get $500 back if you finish before 16 weeks\\n  * Total Cost $2,497\\n  * or\\n  * Pay as little as $153/mo\\n\\n\\n[ Start Application ](http://www.Avocademy.com/</products/ux-ui-design-career-accelerator>)\\nFoundations Course start every Monday as long as there is still availability. \\n* Your rate will be 10-36% APR based on credit, and is subject to an eligibility check.

The program cannot be completed on a phone or table. You are not required to pay for any additional software to complete the Design Foundations portion of the program.

Additional credits are available for purchase.\\nWhen can I start?\\nWe have start dates every Monday as long as there are available spots in that week. When you enroll, you get immediate access to the course. Mentorship begins on your official start date; that is when you can begin booking calls and submitting activities. \\nWhat is the schedule of the course/class times?\\nThere are no set class times. The course content is prerecorded and can be done according to your schedule. Live video calls with mentors are scheduled by you when you need them and when you are available.

It was pretty cool to see all the hard work from researching, interviewing, mapping and wire-framing come together into a digital product!\\nRakim Tyler\\nFormer Chemist\\n#### It's a balanced choice for UX/UI design education\\nAvocademy offers affordability without skimping on value. With features like unlimited mentorship, portfolio projects, and ongoing support for job hunting and real-world client collaborations, it's a balanced choice for UX/UI design education.\\nAaron Henderson\\nFormer Computer Technician\\n#### I always felt like my career was lacking something\\nI have a background in business, education, and psychology, but I always felt like my career was lacking something. Then, I discovered UX design, which combines all three of my interests, and I knew it was the right fit for me. Avocademy was instrumental in reshaping my career, and now, I've never been happier and more fulfilled in my work.\\nNoureen Khan\\nFormer Educator\\n#### I thought I lost my chance to be a designer because I hadn't majored in it\\nIf you think it's too late for you, it's not. Time will pass regardless so why not pursue something you really want? I thought I lost my chance to be a designer because I hadn't majored in it. I happened upon UX Design and a couple months later invested in Avocademy. Now I'm starting a full-time design role and I couldn't be happier. Thank you to Maca and the mentors who have made this course possible and so valuable.\\nMaria Kravetz\\nFormer Receptionist\\n#### These courses fully prepared me for work in this industry\\nI came in knowing almost nothing about UX/UI Design, and through these courses was able to advance my knowledge and gain real world experience working on projects as a sole designer, a designer on a team of 6, and a lead designer with direct interactions with my client. These courses fully prepared me for work in this industry and helped me land a job two months into my job search!\\nBecca Tupaj\\nFormer Catering Director\\nSee More\\n## Your next career move, guaranteed\\nWe know how important this transition is to you and we will do everything we can to help you succeed and land your next UX role. \\nEnroll in the UX/UI Design Career Accelerator⟨12⟩\\n#### Understanding Product Design for AI\\nPersonalized mentorship from industry experts\\nUse those skills to be career- ready by day 1\\n#### Hands-On Experience Creating AI Products\\nGet experience that gets you hired\\nFeel empowered to transform your career\\n#### Get Job-Ready for AI-Focused Roles\\nLand a job faster and more efficiently than ever\\nGet warm introductions to hiring partners and recruiters\\n## Ready to Sign Up?\\nOur UX/UI Design Career Accelerator program is the first step into a high-paying career.\\n  * Learn UX Research, UX Design, UI Design\\nWe provide a comprehensive introduction to UX so you have solid foundation. \\n  * Start Building Your Portfolio\\nThroughout the program you’ll work on a project that you’ll be able to showcase in your portfolio. \\n  * Unlimited Projects\\nWe have mentors across different time zones, so you’ll always have someone to rely on. \\n  * Resume Help\\nWe’ll give you guidance so you can update your resume with all the skills you learned in the program. \\n  * Financing Options\\nWith Affirm you can access payment plans stating at $154/month with 6, 12, 24, 36 month options * \\n\\n\\n### UX/UI Design Career Accelerator program\\nSpend 8 to 16 weeks learning the Foundations of UX Design in a structured and accessible learning environment. \\n  * Program $4,500\\n  * Discount* -$500\\n*Get $500 back if you finish before 16 weeks\\n  * Total Cost $2,497\\n  * or\\n  * Pay as little as $153/mo\\n\\n\\n Start Application ⟨12⟩\\nFoundations Course start every Monday as long as there is still availability. \\n* Your rate will be 10-36% APR based on credit, and is subject to an eligibility check.
