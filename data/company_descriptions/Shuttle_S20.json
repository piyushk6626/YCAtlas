works\\nWith Shuttle you can take any Rust service code, and have it ready for deployment by adding a single annotation to your main function.\\nYour code is packaged and sent to Shuttle where it is compiled and deployed. After a few seconds, your app is already running in the cloud.\\nYou can then add more annotations that control cloud resources. Adding components like databases, secrets or storage is as easy as adding arguments to a function.\\nThe next time you deploy your app, Shuttle provisions and configures the resources you need. In minutes, you can build complex and scalable apps on industry-standard AWS products and never have to touch the AWS console.\\n  * Get Started\\n  * Deploy\\n  * Add a Database\\n  * Deploy Again\\n\\n\\n```\\n1userocket::{get, routes};2\\n3#[get(\"/\")]4fnindex()->&\\'staticstr{5\"Hello, world!\"6}7\\n8#[shuttle_runtime::main]9asyncfnmain()->shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket{10let rocket =rocket::build().mount(\"/\",routes![index]);11\\n12Ok(rocket.into())13}\\n```\\n\\n![bg mobile](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fbg-m.png&w=750&q=75)![bg](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fbg.png&w=1200&q=75)![stars](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fstars-1.png&w=3840&q=75)![stars 2](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fstars-2.png&w=3840&q=75)![comet 1](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fcomet-1.png&w=3840&q=75)![comet 2](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fcomet-2.png&w=3840&q=75)![comet 3](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fcomet-3.png&w=3840&q=75)![moon](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fmoon.png&w=3840&q=75)![earth](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fearth.png&w=3840&q=75)\\n## What the community says\\nJoin thousands of developers using Shuttle.

Together, we can create the future!\\n[Github](https://www.shuttle.rs/<https:/github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle>)[Discord](https://www.shuttle.rs/<https:/discord.gg/shuttle>)[Twitter](https://www.shuttle.rs/<https:/twitter.com/shuttle_dev>)\\n## FAQ\\n### What happens when I deploy to Shuttle?\\nYour code is analyzed and built on our servers. The first time you introduce additional resources in your code, like the first time you use a database, we will add that resource to your project and wire it automatically to your deployment.\\n### Why should I use Rust?\\nWe believe Rust is the language of the future because of the safety guarantees Rust provides and the efficiency of running Rust code. Also, with Rust you build once and everything just works - saving you tons of time on maintenance. And Shuttle makes the experience of building your backend with Rust better than anything you can find for any other language.\\n### Can I use any frontend framework with Shuttle?\\nOf course! When you deploy a project on Shuttle, your API becomes available at a URL of the form ${project_name}.Shuttleapp.rs. And since Shuttle is compatible with any of the common frontend hosting solutions (Vercel, Netlify, etc), you just have to make your API calls to the URL of your project, and you‚Äôre up. Soon you‚Äôll also be able to use Shuttle to deliver static content at the edge and host your preact or Next.js projects with the rest of your code on Shuttle.\\n### Is there a local development experience?\\nAbsolutely. As a matter of fact, Shuttle makes sure that whatever you see in a local development environment works in exactly the same way when it gets deployed to our cloud. This includes all the resources you could end up needing, like databases and secrets for example.\\n### Do you plan to have a WASM runner?\\nWe are putting a lot of effort into developing a WASM runner that plays well with other parts of a Shuttle project. We are very impressed by what we‚Äôre seeing so far in terms of improved build times and faster (we‚Äôre taking milliseconds‚Ä¶) deploy times. We‚Äôre expecting to roll out stable support for WASM services shortly.\\n### How does this differ from using serverless framework with Rust Lambda and provided runtime?\\nYou can bring your lambda code to Shuttle as is.

After a few seconds, your app is already running in the cloud.\\nYou can then add more annotations that control cloud resources. Adding components like databases, secrets or storage is as easy as adding arguments to a function.\\nThe next time you deploy your app, Shuttle provisions and configures the resources you need. In minutes, you can build complex and scalable apps on industry-standard AWS products and never have to touch the AWS console.\\n  * Get Started\\n  * Deploy\\n  * Add a Database\\n  * Deploy Again\\n\\n\\n```\\n1userocket::{get, routes};2\\n3#[get(\"/\")]4fnindex()->&\\'staticstr{5\"Hello, world!\"6}7\\n8#[shuttle_runtime::main]9asyncfnmain()->shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket{10let rocket =rocket::build().mount(\"/\",routes![index]);11\\n12Ok(rocket.into())13}\\n```\\n\\n![bg mobile‚ü®57‚ü©]![bg‚ü®58‚ü©]![stars‚ü®59‚ü©]![stars 2‚ü®60‚ü©]![comet 1‚ü®61‚ü©]![comet 2‚ü®62‚ü©]![comet 3‚ü®63‚ü©]![moon‚ü®64‚ü©]![earth‚ü®65‚ü©]\\n## What the community says\\nJoin thousands of developers using Shuttle.

Together, we can create the future!\\nGithub‚ü®1‚ü©Discord‚ü®7‚ü©Twitter‚ü®2‚ü©\\n## FAQ\\n### What happens when I deploy to Shuttle?\\nYour code is analyzed and built on our servers. The first time you introduce additional resources in your code, like the first time you use a database, we will add that resource to your project and wire it automatically to your deployment.\\n### Why should I use Rust?\\nWe believe Rust is the language of the future because of the safety guarantees Rust provides and the efficiency of running Rust code. Also, with Rust you build once and everything just works - saving you tons of time on maintenance. And Shuttle makes the experience of building your backend with Rust better than anything you can find for any other language.\\n### Can I use any frontend framework with Shuttle?\\nOf course! When you deploy a project on Shuttle, your API becomes available at a URL of the form ${project_name}.Shuttleapp.rs. And since Shuttle is compatible with any of the common frontend hosting solutions (Vercel, Netlify, etc), you just have to make your API calls to the URL of your project, and you‚Äôre up. Soon you‚Äôll also be able to use Shuttle to deliver static content at the edge and host your preact or Next.js projects with the rest of your code on Shuttle.\\n### Is there a local development experience?\\nAbsolutely. As a matter of fact, Shuttle makes sure that whatever you see in a local development environment works in exactly the same way when it gets deployed to our cloud. This includes all the resources you could end up needing, like databases and secrets for example.\\n### Do you plan to have a WASM runner?\\nWe are putting a lot of effort into developing a WASM runner that plays well with other parts of a Shuttle project. We are very impressed by what we‚Äôre seeing so far in terms of improved build times and faster (we‚Äôre taking milliseconds‚Ä¶) deploy times. We‚Äôre expecting to roll out stable support for WASM services shortly.\\n### How does this differ from using serverless framework with Rust Lambda and provided runtime?\\nYou can bring your lambda code to Shuttle as is. And we run it on dedicated infrastructure that keeps the state of your services across requests, has no cold-start and can even have long-running threads, all of which is not possible on AWS
