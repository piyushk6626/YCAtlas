This allows us to collect telemetry data at the kernel level for each container so you don\\'t have to instrument or restart any of your containers. Checkout more at [ebpf.io](https://metoro.io/<https:/ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/>).\\n## \\nWhat happens if there\\'s a bug in Metoro? Will it crash my host?\\nThis is a great question and this was previously a problem with linux kernel modules. However, eBPF is explicitly designed in such a way that an ebpf program crash will not cause the kernel to crash. More info at [ebpf.io safety section](https://metoro.io/<https:/ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/#ebpf-safety>).\\n## \\nHow does Metoro work without manual instrumentation?\\nMetoro uses our own eBPF programs that are loaded into the kernel of all your nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. This means you don\\'t need to restart your containers to start collecting data.\\n## \\nWhich LLM providers does Metoro support for AI features?\\nMetoro currently uses OpenAI models for its AI features. The cloud offering uses Microsoft\\'s hosted OpenAI API.\\n## \\nDo you offer on-premises installations?\\nYes, we do as part of our enterprise offering. Please contact us for more information.\\n## \\nDo I need to enter my credit card details to sign up?\\nNo, you don\\'t need to enter your credit card details to sign up. You can sign up for free and use Metoro for free for limited workloads. When you\\'re ready just upgrade to a paid plan.\\n## \\nIs there a fair usage policy?\\nYes, we have a fair usage policy. Our node-based pricing includes 100GB of data per node. If you exceed this limit, we will contact you to discuss your options.\\n## \\nWhere are your docs?\\n<https://metoro.io/docs>.\\n## \\nHow do I contact support?\\nWe\\'re available at our community [slack](https://metoro.io/<https:/join.slack.com/t/metorocommunity/shared_invite/zt-2makpjl5j-F0WcpGnPcdc8anbNGcewqw>), head on over!

  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Metoro**\n\n**Founded:** 2023  \n**Location:** London, United Kingdom  \n**Team Size:** 2 employees  \n**Funding:** Part of Y Combinator Batch S23  \n\n**Mission:** At its core, Metoro aims to provide instant, in-depth observability for services running in Kubernetes. This addresses a major pain point for developers and operations teams who need to monitor and troubleshoot complex service architectures quickly.\n\n### Key Features\nMetoro stands out in the crowded observability market by offering a wide array of features right out of the box, all without requiring any code changes or instrumentation on your part. Here’s what you can expect when you set it up—generally in under 10 minutes:\n\n- **Traces**: Gain insights into service interactions.\n- **Metrics**: Get comprehensive metrics across infrastructure, application, and language levels.\n- **Logs**: Collect and analyze logs from all containers easily.\n- **Continuous Profiling**: Monitor your applications’ performance over time.\n- **Regression Tracking**: Detect performance regressions automatically.\n- **Network Traffic Inspection**: Understand traffic patterns within your clusters.\n- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the health of your infrastructure.\n- **Alerting**: Get notified about key performance issues.\n- **Automated Diagnostics**: Simplify problem-solving with AI-driven root cause analysis.\n\n### Technology\nMetoro utilizes eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to gather observability data directly from the kernel, eliminating the need for any manual instrumentation or container restarts. This not only speeds up setup but also enhances the data's accuracy, ensuring you're getting the best possible insights.\n\n### Pricing\nMetoro has adopted a straightforward pricing model, which includes:\n- **Hobby Plan**: Free for small workloads with one cluster and two nodes.\n- **Scale Plan**: $20 per node per month for unlimited clusters and users.\n- **Enterprise Plan**: Custom pricing with additional support and on-premises deployments.\n\n### Support & Community\nMetoro values its user base and provides access to a supportive community through Slack. This is where users can ask questions, share insights, and get help from both Metoro’s team and other users.\n\n### Conclusion\nMetoro is positioned as a robust observability platform tailored specifically for Kubernetes environments.
