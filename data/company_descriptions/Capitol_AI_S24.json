  "generated_description": "**Capitol AI: Revolutionizing Content Delivery**\n\nFounded in 2021 and based in Washington, DC, Capitol AI is on a mission to create a ‚Äúcustom perplexity‚Äù solution for every website in the world. Initially launching as As Perplexity or Gemini‚Äîinnovative tools aiming to replace traditional Google searches‚ÄîCapitol AI is addressing a looming existential threat faced by media brands. By offering a sophisticated API, Capitol empowers publishers to deliver personalized search results, research reports, and even social media content all within their paywalls, thereby enhancing their relationship with users.\n\nCapitol AI experienced rapid growth, generating $1.68 million in revenue during its time at Y Combinator. It became a vital partner for Politico, helping power their Politico Pro Subscription product, and positioned itself directly in the fight against generic search engines that strip publishers of direct customer engagement. \n\nThe demand for instant, personalized answers has never been higher, and Capitol aims to bridge the gap where publishers can't‚Äîor won't‚Äîdevelop these capabilities on their own. With an expansive market currently valued at $16 billion, projected to grow to $85.6 billion by 2030, Capitol AI is poised to become the critical last mile of content delivery for publishers. \n\nWith a lean team of 11 and under the guidance of Y Combinator Group Partner Garry Tan, Capitol AI is tagged in fields like artificial intelligence, workflow automation, analytics, and media. They are armed and ready; while Gemini and Perplexity may dominate the landscape, Capitol is empowering the rebellion of content creators.\n\nFor more about Capitol AI and their offerings, you can visit their website at [capitol.ai](https://www.capitol.ai/)."
