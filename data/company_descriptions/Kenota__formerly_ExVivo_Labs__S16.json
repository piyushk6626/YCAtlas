Founded in 2014 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S16, the company is based in Kitchener, Canada, and has grown to a dedicated team of 35.\n\n**Website:** [kenota.com](https://kenota.com/)\n\n### What They Do\n\nKenota has developed an innovative point-of-care allergy testing solution that delivers lab-quality results right in the allergist's office. This means patients can get tested and receive accurate results during a single visit, eliminating the traditional need for lab referrals and long waiting periods. Their flagship system, the Kenota 1, has received significant regulatory approval, including FDA 510(k) clearance and a CLIA waiver for in-office testing of Total IgE.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Speed:** Test results in just 30 minutes.\n- **Less Invasive:** Utilizes a simple fingerstick method to collect blood samples.\n- **Convenience:** Allows for immediate reporting and diagnosis, all within one visit.\n\n### The Importance of Allergy Testing\n\nWith 32 million people in the U.S. suffering from food allergies, many of which can be life-threatening, Kenota's advancements in allergy testing are crucial. Their point-of-care approach allows allergists to quickly assess patients' sensitizations to allergens, significantly improving patient care.\n\n### Milestones & Achievements\n\n- **2018:** Concept development for the allergy testing system.\n- **2019:** Established a scalable manufacturing facility in Waterloo Region.\n- **2020:** Raised $11 million in Series A funding.\n- **2023:** Completed clinical studies; received FDA clearance.\n- **2024:** First CLIA Waiver approval for in-office Total IgE testing.\n\n### The Team\n\nKenota boasts a team rich in scientific, clinical, and commercial expertise. Their approach is deeply rooted in collaboration with healthcare professionals to tailor their solutions to real-world needs in allergy diagnosis.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nKenota is not just stopping at allergy diagnostics; their technology could easily adapt to other medical conditions, extending its impact on healthcare further.
