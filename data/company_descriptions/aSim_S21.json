Once the top\\nrow is full, go to the next row \\\\(starting at the player count\\nspace\\\\) until you place onto the space to the left of the job\\ntoken. Depending on player count, there will be 3, 5, or 7\\nworker tiles placed.\\n- Now fill the 6 foresight spaces in Kansas City with tiles from\\nthe supply – 2 from the 1 bag under the 1, 2 from the 2 bag\\nunder the 2, and 2 from the 3 bag under the 3.\\n- Shuffle the 36 market cattle cards and place them as a face-\\ndown market cattle stack beneath the lower left of the board.\\nDraw 7 / 10 / 13 cards for 2 / 3 / 4 players. Sort them by color\\nat the bottom of the board.\\n- The orange Simmental cow variant – add all 8 stage 1\\nSimmental cows to the 36 market cattle cards and shuffle.\\nPlace the Simmental market tile on the game board on its\\nspace. Instead of the above, draw 9 / 12 / 15 cards for 2 / 3 /\\n4 players. Sort them by color at the bottom of the board,\\nwith the Simmental cows to the very left. Take the stage 2\\nand stage 3 Simmental cows and place them near the board.\\n- Shuffle the 24 objective cards and place them as a face-down\\nstack to the right of the board. Then reveal 4 cards from the\\nstack and display them face up as the general objective\\ndisplay.\\n- Place the coins and exchange tokens within reach of the\\nplayers as the bank.\\n- Each player chooses a color and gets a player board and a\\nplayer count tile \\\\(with 2-3p. Turn it to the appropriate side\\nand use it to cover Phase A on your player board.\\n- Each player receives 12 private building tiles in their color.\\nEveryone plays with the same side of buildings – so all As or all\\nBs. Once you know the game, you can play with a mix of As\\nand Bs, but everyone still uses the same buildings – if 1B is\\nchosen, then EVERYONE uses 1B.\\n- Each player gets 14 discs \\\\(to cover the colored disc spaces on\\nthe player board\\\\), 1 engine \\\\(placed on the red building near\\nthe track\\\\), 1 certificate marker \\\\(placed on the 0 space of the\\ncertificate track, and 1 herder in their color.\\n- Each player gets 14 player cattle cards in their color \\\\(shown\\non the star\\\\) to make their herd deck.\\n- Shuffle the 4 starting objective cards and deal one at random\\nto each player, which they place face-up in their personal\\nobjective area. Return any remaining starting objectives to the\\nbox.\\n- Determine a start player and give them $6, 4 cards, 1\\nexchange token. Subsequent players get $7, 5 cards, 1\\nexchange token / $8, 6 cards, 1 exchange token / $9, 7 cards, 1\\nexchange token for 2nd / 3rd / 4th player.\\n- Before the first turn of the game, EVERYONE discards down\\nto 4 cards in their starting hand, placing discards in each\\nplayer’s personal discard pile.\\n- Each player then places their herder onto ANY neutral\\nbuilding tile AND CONTINUES TO PHASE B, AS NORMAL.\\nPlayers CAN start at the same building.\\nObject of the Game\\nThe game is played over a number of rounds. Players will\\nmove their herder along the trail to gain victory points \\\\(VP\\\\) by\\nplacing private buildings, buying cattle from the market,\\nupgrading stations, and removing hazards. Each time your\\nherder reaches Kansas City, you send your cattle off to possibly\\ngain VP, then return to the beginning of the trail to start again.\\nALL VP are awarded at the end of the game.\\nYour herd deck is reshuffled ONLY when you need to draw\\nagain. At certain locations, you can discard cattle cards for\\nrewards and when you reach Kansas City, you want as many\\ndifferent types of cattle to get more VP.\\nGAMEPLAY\\nThe game is played with each player playing the following 3\\nphases, before moving to the next clockwise player.\\nA – Move your herder to another location on the trail\\nB – Use the action\\\\(s\\\\) of your reached location\\nC – Draw up to your hand limit\\nPHASE A – MOVE YOUR HERDER TO A LOCATION\\n- A location is ANY tile on a space of the trail. Spaces\\nWITHOUT a tile are NOT locations.\\n- Your herder’s movement is measured in steps. Each location\\nis 1 step.\\n- Your herder MUST move at LEAST 1 step up to their step limit\\n\\\\(3 or 4, depending on player count\\\\), which can be increased\\nlater in the game.\\n- You MUST ALWAYS move your herder FORWARD along the\\ntrail, following the arrows and may choose either path when it\\nforks.\\n- The location where your herder ends their movement is the\\nlocation you will use in Phase B.\\n- You are NOT allowed to pass OVER Kansas City. Once you\\nreach Kansas City, your herder ends its movement there.\\n- Multiple players’ herders can share a location.\\nIMPORTANT – Several locations show a green or black hand\\n\\\\(or BOTH\\\\). If your herder moves to or passes over such a\\nlocation, you MUST pay a fee.\\nIf it’s a hazard/outlaw, the fee is paid to the BANK. If it’s\\nanother player’s private building, the fee is paid to that\\nPLAYER.\\nThe fee depends on player count. In a 2p game, each hand is\\n$2. In a 3p game, green hands cost $2 and black hands cost\\n$1. In a 4p game, green hands cost $1 and black hands cost\\n$2.\\nIMPORTANT – Even if you cannot pay some or all of the\\nhands along your path, you are STILL ALLOWED to move. You\\npay what you can and continue moving. Inability to pay hand\\nfees DOES NOT stop your movement. This ONLY applies to\\nhand fees. ANY OTHER costs/requirements in the game\\nMUST ALWAYS be paid/met in full.\\nPHASE B – USE THE ACTION OF YOUR REACHED LOCATION\\nAfter moving your herder, use the location where you ended\\nyour movement. Your options vary depending on whether it\\nis:\\n• A neutral building or YOUR private building\\n• ANOTHER player’s private building, hazard, or outlaw.\\n• Kansas City\\na. – On a neutral building or YOUR private building, you have\\ntwo options – use the local action\\\\(s\\\\) of the tile OR use ONE\\nsingle auxiliary action.\\nIf you choose to use the tiles local actions, you MAY perform\\nEACH of the tile’s local actions ONCE and MAY perform them\\nin ANY order.\\nYou do NOT have to perform ALL of the available actions, but if\\nthere is a cost/requirement, you MUST pay/meet it in full to\\ngain the reward.\\nActions separated by a white slash are either/or NOT both.\\nSpaces separated by full-length straight lines ARE both/all.\\nSome spaces of the trail have risk actions attached. If a\\nbuilding tile is placed on such a space, the risk action becomes\\npart of that building tile’s local actions and can be performed\\nby its OWNER each time that player reaches that location.\\nIf you do NOT perform ANY of the tile’s local actions, then you\\nMAY perform ONE single auxiliary action instead. Auxiliary\\nactions are on the left of your player board. Initially, you only\\nhave two of them available.\\nb. – On another player’s building tile, hazard, or outlaw tile,\\nyou have ONLY ONE option – performing ONE single auxiliary\\naction.\\nc. – When you reach Kansas City, you MUST carry out ALL 5\\nKansas City subphases IN ORDER. They are:\\n1 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 1 and\\nmove it to its corresponding section.\\n2 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 2 and\\nmove it to its corresponding section.\\n3 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 3 and\\nmove it to its corresponding section.\\n4 – Reveal your ENTIRE hand, calculate your income\\nfrom the bank, then discard your ENTIRE hand to\\nyour discard pile.\\n5 – Move one of your player discs from your player\\nboard onto a city crest and pay ANY transport costs.\\n\\\\(1-2-3\\\\) Each of the 3 tiles in subphases 1, 2, and 3 must\\nIMMEDIATELY be moved to its corresponding section to the\\nlowest available space. If no space is available, take the tile\\nout of the game and return it to the box.\\nIf it is an outlaw tile \\\\(green or orange\\\\), place it in the outlaw\\nsection onto the empty space with the lowest number. If no\\nempty space is left there, take the tile out of the game.\\nIf it is a hazard tile \\\\(flood, drought, or rockfall\\\\), place it in the\\ncorresponding section onto the empty space with the lowest\\nnumber. If no empty space is left there, take the tile out of the\\ngame.\\nIf it is a worker tile, it MUST be placed in the next free space of\\nthe job market – starting with the row with the job market\\ntoken.\\nAs soon as you need to place a worker tile on the job market\\ntoken space, slide the job market token down to the dashed\\nround space of the next row.\\nIf the job market token crosses over a yellow arrow, you\\nIMMEDIATELY fill up the cattle market, bringing the cattle\\nmarket back up to 7 / 10 / 13 cards \\\\(or 9 / 12 / 15 with\\nSimmental variant\\\\) for 2 / 3 / 4 players.\\nIf you need to refill the cattle market and the total cards there\\nare already equal to or higher than the amount, do NOT add\\nany cards.\\nIf the cattle market stack is empty, no more cards are added to\\nthe cattle market.\\nIf the job market token moves over the green arrow at the\\nbottom, the game end is triggered.\\n\\\\(4 – Income\\\\) Reveal your ENTIRE hand and calculate its\\nbreeding value. To do this, add the breeding values of each\\nDIFFERENT TYPE of cattle in your hand. Each type is ONLY\\ncounted ONCE.\\nThen, if possible, you MAY increase the total breeding value by\\nadding certificates \\\\(temporary or permanent\\\\) to it. Temporary\\ncertificates are those on your certificate track and you add\\nthem by moving your marker back. Permanent certificates are\\nthose on the upper half of any station master tiles in front of\\nyou, permanently increasing your breeding value for the rest\\nof the game.\\nOnce your breeding value is set, take that many dollars from\\nthe bank, placing it aside to track your breeding value for\\nsubphase 5. Simmental variant – AFTER setting your breeding\\nvalue, if you have any stage 1 Simmental cattle cards in your\\nhand, you may remove them from the game and take the\\nsame number of stage 2 Simmental cattle cards and place\\nthem on your discard pile. If you have any stage 2 Simmental\\ncattle cards in your hand, you may remove them from the\\ngame and take the same number of stage 3 Simmental cattle\\ncards and place them on your discard pile. THESE DO NOT\\nINCREASE YOUR JUST CALCULATED BREEDING VALUE.\\nWhen calculating your breeding value, you can ONLY add\\nONE of your Simmental cattle cards REGARDLESS of stage.\\nIf an action requires you to discard a cattle card of a certain\\nbreeding value, but the icon DOES NOT include orange cattle\\ncards, you CANNOT discard a Simmental cattle card.\\nThen, discard ALL cards from your hand.\\n\\\\(5 – Delivery\\\\) Pick a city whose city value is equal to or less\\nthan your breeding value. You CANNOT pick a city that you\\nhave already delivered to before, EXCEPT for the local city –\\nKansas City – and the terminal city – New York.\\nOnce you have chosen a city, place one of your player discs\\nfrom your board onto the city space.\\nA disc taken from a WHITE-cornered space on your board can\\nbe placed onto ANY city space. A disc taken from a DARK-\\ncornered space can ONLY be placed onto a DARK-cornered city\\nspace.\\nBy clearing a disc space on your board, you unlock an ability.\\nSome disc spaces give an additional reward or have an added\\ncost for clearing them.\\nBy placing your disc onto a city space, you may gain or lose VP\\nat the end of the game and may trigger delivery actions that\\nyou MUST perform IMMEDIATELY. The action in any of the\\ngreen arrows is NOT triggered until BOTH city spaces have one\\nof your discs. This also goes for VP at game end.\\nEXCEPTION – if you have NO MORE WHITE-CORNERED discs\\non your board and have to place one, you MAY take a DARK-\\nCORNERED ONE!\\nFinally, check if there are any transport costs based on how\\nmany RED Xs are between the nose of your engine and the city\\ncrest to which you are delivering. Pay $1 for each of them and\\nthis payment MAY come from the money you just received for\\ndelivering.\\nAfter finishing the Delivery subphase, move your herder to the\\nhorseman space at the beginning of the trail and refill the\\nempty foresight spaces with the appropriate tiles from the\\nmatching numbered bag.\\nPHASE C – DRAW UP TO YOUR HAND LIMIT\\nEach player starts with a hand limit of 4 and can increase it up\\nto 6. If you have fewer cards in hand than your hand limit,\\ndraw cards from your personal draw pile to equal your hand\\nlimit, shuffling your discards as necessary. Once this phase is\\ncomplete, it is the next player’s turn.\\nHire One Worker\\nWhen you perform this action, choose exactly ONE worker tile\\nfrom the job market, pay the cost and place that tile in the\\nworker section of your player board.\\nYou CANNOT hire a worker from the row where the job\\nmarket token is CURRENTLY located. Those workers are\\nUNAVAILABLE until the job market has moved on.\\nThe hiring cost of any of the workers is the cost on the right\\nside of their row, but it is modified by the value on the action\\nitself. A + in green means a discount. A – in red means an\\nadded cost.\\nAfter paying the cost, place the worker tile in the worker\\nsection of your player board onto the leftmost free space of its\\ntype. Each player starts with one worker of each of the three\\ntypes on their board.\\nIf the space on which you placed the hired worker depicts an\\nimmediate action, you MUST choose to either perform the\\naction IMMEDIATELY OR FORFEIT IT.\\nIf the row is already full, you CANNOT hire another worker of\\nthat type. At the end of the game, every worker placed on the\\n5th or 6th space is worth 4 VP.\\nBuying from the Cattle Market\\nWhen you perform this action, you can acquire new cattle\\ncards from the cattle market and place them face-up on your\\ndiscard pile. However, the number of cards you can buy\\ndepends on how many cowboys you have and how much\\nmoney you want to spend.\\nYou don’t SPEND cowboys, you USE them. The amount of\\ncowboys used will tell you your purchase options at the\\nbottom of the board. EACH cowboy can ONLY be used ONCE\\nduring this action.\\nFor example: If you use just one cowboy, you can either buy\\none 3-value card for $6 OR buy one 4-value card for $12. You\\ncan ONLY buy cattle cards that are available and can ALWAYS\\nchoose to buy fewer cards than allowed.\\nAny cowboy that you do NOT put to use to buy cattle cards\\nMAY instead be used to draw 2 cards from the market cattle\\nstack and be added face-up to the cattle market. You MAY do\\nthis at ANY given moment when performing the action.\\nSimmental variant – you can also use 1 cowboy to buy one\\nstage 1 Simmental for $8 or use 2 cowboys to buy one stage 1\\nSimmental for $5.\\nMovement on the Railroad Track\\nWith this action, you may move your engine up to as many\\nspaces FORWARD on the railroad track as you have engineers\\nin your engineer row.\\nWhenever you move your engine, you SKIP over spaces with\\nother engines as NO two engines can occupy the SAME space.\\nAlong the track, there are several turnout spaces with train\\nstations. Each turnout space COUNTS as an additional space.\\nYou MAY move your engine less spaces than allowed \\\\(but\\nMUST move at LEAST 1\\\\), however once you stop, you forfeit\\nany additional movement.\\nIf you stop on a turnout space, you MUST IMMEDIATELY\\ndecide if you are going to upgrade the station. You can only\\nupgrade a station if you have not upgraded it before \\\\(your disc\\nisn’t already there\\\\).\\nTo upgrade the station, pay the upgrade cost and place one of\\nyour discs on the station space. Again, you must follow the\\nrules for disc placement as for delivery – WHITE can go on any\\none, DARK can only go on DARK.\\nAfter you place your disc, you may take a station master tile\\nthere by taking any hired worker from the rightmost space of\\nyour player board and placing it there.\\nYou can ONLY choose to do this at the moment you are\\nupgrading the station, NOT later.\\nIf you remove a worker from your board uncovering an\\nimmediate action, you CAN perform that action again the next\\ntime you hire a worker onto that space. Once its placed on the\\nstation, it remains there for the rest of the game.\\nEach station master tile has two parts. The top half is an\\nimmediate action \\\\(performed IMMEDIATELY or forfeited\\\\) or\\npermanent certificate. The bottom half is a unique way to\\nscore more VP at game end.\\nThe last space of the railroad track is special. If your engine\\nreaches the last space, its movement ends there \\\\(potentially\\nupgrading the station as usual\\\\). Then you must move your\\nengine BACKWARDS at LEAST one space and you MAY move it\\nto ANY free space on the track, INCLUDING a turnout space.\\nAfter doing so, immediately gain $3. If you moved to a turnout\\nspace, you MAY IMMEDIATELY upgrade it as usual \\\\(even using\\nthe money you JUST received\\\\).\\nIf you ever need to move your engine backwards a certain\\namount of spaces, you MUST move it the full amount, even\\ngoing into a turnout space.\\nObjective Cards\\nWhen you gain an objective card, EITHER choose one from the\\nface-up display OR take one from the top of the deck, placing\\nit in your discard pile. If you take one from the display,\\nIMMEDIATELY fill the vacant space, EVEN if you have\\nunlocked multiple city spaces giving you two of them!\\nDuring your turn, if you happen to have one or more objective\\ncards in your hand, you can play any of them, either before\\nPhase A or before or after performing any one action in Phase\\nB.\\nWhen played, place it face-up in your personal objective area,\\nTHEN perform the immediate action in the card’s upper left\\ncorner or forfeit it.\\nEach objective card depicts a combination of tasks to be\\nfulfilled at the END OF THE GAME. If all are fulfilled, then you\\ngain the VP. If they are NOT fulfilled, then you lose the\\nnegative VP printed on it.\\nIMPORTANT – EACH SINGLE task can ONLY count towards\\nONE objective card – NO double-dipping on objective cards.\\nStation master bonuses are INDEPENDENT from objective\\ncards.\\nYou are NOT required to play your objective cards. If you\\nwant, you can keep some or all of them in your deck without\\ncommitting to them during the game, though they will clog\\nyour deck. At the end of the game, you will have the option to\\npull these objective cards from your deck to score them or not\\nand suffer no penalty.\\nPlace one of your private buildings\\nWhen you perform this action, choose ONE of the private\\nbuildings above your player board. EITHER place it onto ANY\\nempty building space on the trail OR use it to replace one of\\nyour private buildings already placed.\\nYou CANNOT flip the tile from the side chosen at setup.\\nYou MUST have enough builders AND be able to pay the\\nbuilding cost.\\nIn its upper left corner, each building tile shows the minimum\\nnumber of builders that you must have to place the building.\\nFor EACH builder needed, you MUST pay $2.\\nYou can use this action to replace one of your buildings, with a\\nHIGHER valued building. For this, you only need to have the\\nDIFFERENCE of builders between the two buildings and must\\nonly pay the difference as well. Then replace the old building\\nwith the new one, REMOVING the old one from the game.\\nThis is the ONLY way to place buildings that require more than\\n6 workers.\\nIf you replace a building with your herder on it, you do NOT\\nget to immediately use the new building.\\nPerform single/double auxiliary actions\\nWhenever you use a single auxiliary action, you ONLY get its\\nbenefit ONCE, even if both spaces are cleared. You MAY use\\nan auxiliary actions with both spaces cleared as a single.\\nWhenever you use a double auxiliary action, you can ONLY\\nchoose an auxiliary action that has both spaces cleared,\\ngaining double the reward. You CAN use this to only do a\\nsingle auxiliary action.\\nIf you ever need to move your engine backwards on the train\\ntrack, you MUST move the full number of spaces.\\nCollect bounty for outlaws\\nWhen you perform this action, you can remove ONE outlaw\\ntile of your choice from the outlaw section and place it in front\\nof you for potential game end VP. Depending on the money\\nvalue above the outlaw tile, you will either receive or pay\\nmoney to the bank.\\nIf the outlaw section is empty, you CANNOT get a tile. If there\\nis a herder on a removed tile, it stays there.\\nGain an exchange token\\nWhen you perform this action, gain ONE exchange token from\\nthe bank.\\nYou can use one OR MORE of them at ANY point, even when it\\nisn’t your turn. To use an exchange token, place it back in the\\nbank, then draw 2 cards from your personal draw stack and\\nIMMEDIATELY discard as many cards as you drew.\\nRemoving a Hazard\\nWhen you remove a hazard tile, you can remove ONE hazard\\ntile of your choice and place it in front of you for game end VP.\\nIf the icon shows a cost, you MUST IMMEDIATELY pay that\\ncost or you cannot take the tile.\\nIf all three hazard sections are empty, you CANNOT get a tile.\\nIf there is a herder on a removed tile, it stays there.\\nMove your herder forward\\nThis action lets you move your herder to another location\\nalong the trail. If you do, you MUST move at least 1 step and\\nCANNOT move it more steps than indicated.\\nOn the location you stop, you MUST then perform all of phase\\nB again. You DO NOT replenish your hand cards before\\nperforming this phase B again – ONLY at the end of your turn.\\nGAME END\\nThe game end is triggered when a player places a worker tile\\nonto the LAST space of the job market during subphase 2 or 3\\nin Kansas City. When the job market token crosses over the\\ngreen arrow, that player takes the token \\\\(worth 2 VP at game\\nend\\\\). This is that player’s LAST turn. Then, EACH OTHER\\nplayer has ONE final turn.\\nWorker tiles CANNOT be chosen to be placed from the\\nforesight spaces during these last turns by anyone reaching\\nKansas City.\\nAfter the last player has finished their final turn, the game\\nends.\\nFINAL SCORING\\nPlayers score as follows:\\n1 – 1 VP per $5 on hand\\n2 – VP from private buildings on the board\\n3 – VP total from city spaces with their disc\\n4 – VP total from train stations with their disc\\n5 – VP from hazard tiles collected\\n6 – VP from cattle cards in deck, hand, and discard pile\\n7 – VP from objective cards on the table, pulling any still in\\ntheir deck that they want to score\\n8 – VP from individual tasks at the bottoms of any station\\nmaster tiles – again, these items can independently be\\nitems used for objective cards as well\\n9 – 4 VP for each worker placed on the 5th or 6th space of\\nany row in their worker section\\n10 – 3 VP for the appropriate space cleared from their\\nplayer board\\n11 – 2 VP for the job market token\\nMost VP wins the game and there is NO TIE-BREAKER](https://s.asim.sh/images/9aKgI5SIWZj1e2uSrgdr3.jpeg)3100Create player aid for Great Western Trail: 2nd Edition. Guide to Great Western Trail 2nd Edition SET-UP - Shuffle the 9 station master tiles and place one randomly onto each of the 5 station master spaces. - Take the 7 neutral building tiles and place one onto each of the 7 neutral building spaces on the board. For your first game, place them in letter order (A-G). You can also place them randomly once you’re comfortable with the game. - Place the job market token on the top dashed round space in the job market. - Take the 54 worker tiles, the 22 outlaw tiles, and the 18 hazard tiles and sort them back their backs (1 / 2 / 3). Then place them in their corresponding bags near Kansas City to form the Kansas City supply. - From the Kansas City supply, draw 7 tiles from the 1 bag and place them one after another on the game board. If it is an outlaw tile (green or orange), place it in the outlaw section on the lowest, empty numbered space. If it is a hazard tile, place it in the corresponding hazard section on the lowest, empty numbered space. If there is no empty space left, return it to the bag and draw a new tile. - Start drawing tiles with from the 2 bag. Place these workers one after the other on the job market as follows: Start in the top row and place the first on the space based on player count. Place the next to the right and continue like this. Once the top row is full, go to the next row (starting at the player count space) until you place onto the space to the left of the job token. Depending on player count, there will be 3, 5, or 7 worker tiles placed. - Now fill the 6 foresight spaces in Kansas City with tiles from the supply – 2 from the 1 bag under the 1, 2 from the 2 bag under the 2, and 2 from the 3 bag under the 3. - Shuffle the 36 market cattle cards and place them as a face- down market cattle stack beneath the lower left of the board. Draw 7 / 10 / 13 cards for 2 / 3 / 4 players. Sort them by color at the bottom of the board. - The orange Simmental cow variant – add all 8 stage 1 Simmental cows to the 36 market cattle cards and shuffle. Place the Simmental market tile on the game board on its space. Instead of the above, draw 9 / 12 / 15 cards for 2 / 3 / 4 players. Sort them by color at the bottom of the board, with the Simmental cows to the very left. Take the stage 2 and stage 3 Simmental cows and place them near the board. - Shuffle the 24 objective cards and place them as a face-down stack to the right of the board. Then reveal 4 cards from the stack and display them face up as the general objective display. - Place the coins and exchange tokens within reach of the players as the bank. - Each player chooses a color and gets a player board and a player count tile (with 2-3p. Turn it to the appropriate side and use it to cover Phase A on your player board. - Each player receives 12 private building tiles in their color. Everyone plays with the same side of buildings – so all As or all Bs. Once you know the game, you can play with a mix of As and Bs, but everyone still uses the same buildings – if 1B is chosen, then EVERYONE uses 1B. - Each player gets 14 discs (to cover the colored disc spaces on the player board), 1 engine (placed on the red building near the track), 1 certificate marker (placed on the 0 space of the certificate track, and 1 herder in their color. - Each player gets 14 player cattle cards in their color (shown on the star) to make their herd deck. - Shuffle the 4 starting objective cards and deal one at random to each player, which they place face-up in their personal objective area. Return any remaining starting objectives to the box. - Determine a start player and give them $6, 4 cards, 1 exchange token. Subsequent players get $7, 5 cards, 1 exchange token / $8, 6 cards, 1 exchange token / $9, 7 cards, 1 exchange token for 2nd / 3rd / 4th player. - Before the first turn of the game, EVERYONE discards down to 4 cards in their starting hand, placing discards in each player’s personal discard pile. - Each player then places their herder onto ANY neutral building tile AND CONTINUES TO PHASE B, AS NORMAL. Players CAN start at the same building. Object of the Game The game is played over a number of rounds. Players will move their herder along the trail to gain victory points (VP) by placing private buildings, buying cattle from the market, upgrading stations, and removing hazards. Each time your herder reaches Kansas City, you send your cattle off to possibly gain VP, then return to the beginning of the trail to start again. ALL VP are awarded at the end of the game. Your herd deck is reshuffled ONLY when you need to draw again. At certain locations, you can discard cattle cards for rewards and when you reach Kansas City, you want as many different types of cattle to get more VP. GAMEPLAY The game is played with each player playing the following 3 phases, before moving to the next clockwise player. A – Move your herder to another location on the trail B – Use the action(s) of your reached location C – Draw up to your hand limit PHASE A – MOVE YOUR HERDER TO A LOCATION - A location is ANY tile on a space of the trail. Spaces WITHOUT a tile are NOT locations. - Your herder’s movement is measured in steps. Each location is 1 step. - Your herder MUST move at LEAST 1 step up to their step limit (3 or 4, depending on player count), which can be increased later in the game. - You MUST ALWAYS move your herder FORWARD along the trail, following the arrows and may choose either path when it forks. - The location where your herder ends their movement is the location you will use in Phase B. - You are NOT allowed to pass OVER Kansas City. Once you reach Kansas City, your herder ends its movement there. - Multiple players’ herders can share a location. IMPORTANT – Several locations show a green or black hand (or BOTH). If your herder moves to or passes over such a location, you MUST pay a fee. If it’s a hazard/outlaw, the fee is paid to the BANK. If it’s another player’s private building, the fee is paid to that PLAYER. The fee depends on player count. In a 2p game, each hand is $2. In a 3p game, green hands cost $2 and black hands cost $1. In a 4p game, green hands cost $1 and black hands cost $2. IMPORTANT – Even if you cannot pay some or all of the hands along your path, you are STILL ALLOWED to move. You pay what you can and continue moving. Inability to pay hand fees DOES NOT stop your movement. This ONLY applies to hand fees. ANY OTHER costs/requirements in the game MUST ALWAYS be paid/met in full. PHASE B – USE THE ACTION OF YOUR REACHED LOCATION After moving your herder, use the location where you ended your movement. Your options vary depending on whether it is: • A neutral building or YOUR private building • ANOTHER player’s private building, hazard, or outlaw. • Kansas City a. – On a neutral building or YOUR private building, you have two options – use the local action(s) of the tile OR use ONE single auxiliary action. If you choose to use the tiles local actions, you MAY perform EACH of the tile’s local actions ONCE and MAY perform them in ANY order. You do NOT have to perform ALL of the available actions, but if there is a cost/requirement, you MUST pay/meet it in full to gain the reward. Actions separated by a white slash are either/or NOT both. Spaces separated by full-length straight lines ARE both/all. Some spaces of the trail have risk actions attached. If a building tile is placed on such a space, the risk action becomes part of that building tile’s local actions and can be performed by its OWNER each time that player reaches that location. If you do NOT perform ANY of the tile’s local actions, then you MAY perform ONE single auxiliary action instead. Auxiliary actions are on the left of your player board. Initially, you only have two of them available. b. – On another player’s building tile, hazard, or outlaw tile, you have ONLY ONE option – performing ONE single auxiliary action. c. – When you reach Kansas City, you MUST carry out ALL 5 Kansas City subphases IN ORDER. They are: 1 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 1 and move it to its corresponding section. 2 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 2 and move it to its corresponding section. 3 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 3 and move it to its corresponding section. 4 – Reveal your ENTIRE hand, calculate your income from the bank, then discard your ENTIRE hand to your discard pile. 5 – Move one of your player discs from your player board onto a city crest and pay ANY transport costs. (1-2-3) Each of the 3 tiles in subphases 1, 2, and 3 must IMMEDIATELY be moved to its corresponding section to the lowest available space. If no space is available, take the tile out of the game and return it to the box. If it is an outlaw tile (green or orange), place it in the outlaw section onto the empty space with the lowest number. If no empty space is left there, take the tile out of the game. If it is a hazard tile (flood, drought, or rockfall), place it in the corresponding section onto the empty space with the lowest number. If no empty space is left there, take the tile out of the game. If it is a worker tile, it MUST be placed in the next free space of the job market – starting with the row with the job market token. As soon as you need to place a worker tile on the job market token space, slide the job market token down to the dashed round space of the next row. If the job market token crosses over a yellow arrow, you IMMEDIATELY fill up the cattle market, bringing the cattle market back up to 7 / 10 / 13 cards (or 9 / 12 / 15 with Simmental variant) for 2 / 3 / 4 players. If you need to refill the cattle market and the total cards there are already equal to or higher than the amount, do NOT add any cards. If the cattle market stack is empty, no more cards are added to the cattle market. If the job market token moves over the green arrow at the bottom, the game end is triggered. (4 – Income) Reveal your ENTIRE hand and calculate its breeding value. To do this, add the breeding values of each DIFFERENT TYPE of cattle in your hand. Each type is ONLY counted ONCE. Then, if possible, you MAY increase the total breeding value by adding certificates (temporary or permanent) to it. Temporary certificates are those on your certificate track and you add them by moving your marker back. Permanent certificates are those on the upper half of any station master tiles in front of you, permanently increasing your breeding value for the rest of the game. Once your breeding value is set, take that many dollars from the bank, placing it aside to track your breeding value for subphase 5. Simmental variant – AFTER setting your breeding value, if you have any stage 1 Simmental cattle cards in your hand, you may remove them from the game and take the same number of stage 2 Simmental cattle cards and place them on your discard pile. If you have any stage 2 Simmental cattle cards in your hand, you may remove them from the game and take the same number of stage 3 Simmental cattle cards and place them on your discard pile. THESE DO NOT INCREASE YOUR JUST CALCULATED BREEDING VALUE. When calculating your breeding value, you can ONLY add ONE of your Simmental cattle cards REGARDLESS of stage. If an action requires you to discard a cattle card of a certain breeding value, but the icon DOES NOT include orange cattle cards, you CANNOT discard a Simmental cattle card. Then, discard ALL cards from your hand. (5 – Delivery) Pick a city whose city value is equal to or less than your breeding value. You CANNOT pick a city that you have already delivered to before, EXCEPT for the local city – Kansas City – and the terminal city – New York. Once you have chosen a city, place one of your player discs from your board onto the city space. A disc taken from a WHITE-cornered space on your board can be placed onto ANY city space. A disc taken from a DARK- cornered space can ONLY be placed onto a DARK-cornered city space. By clearing a disc space on your board, you unlock an ability. Some disc spaces give an additional reward or have an added cost for clearing them. By placing your disc onto a city space, you may gain or lose VP at the end of the game and may trigger delivery actions that you MUST perform IMMEDIATELY. The action in any of the green arrows is NOT triggered until BOTH city spaces have one of your discs. This also goes for VP at game end. EXCEPTION – if you have NO MORE WHITE-CORNERED discs on your board and have to place one, you MAY take a DARK- CORNERED ONE! Finally, check if there are any transport costs based on how many RED Xs are between the nose of your engine and the city crest to which you are delivering. Pay $1 for each of them and this payment MAY come from the money you just received for delivering. After finishing the Delivery subphase, move your herder to the horseman space at the beginning of the trail and refill the empty foresight spaces with the appropriate tiles from the matching numbered bag. PHASE C – DRAW UP TO YOUR HAND LIMIT Each player starts with a hand limit of 4 and can increase it up to 6. If you have fewer cards in hand than your hand limit, draw cards from your personal draw pile to equal your hand limit, shuffling your discards as necessary. Once this phase is complete, it is the next player’s turn. Hire One Worker When you perform this action, choose exactly ONE worker tile from the job market, pay the cost and place that tile in the worker section of your player board. You CANNOT hire a worker from the row where the job market token is CURRENTLY located. Those workers are UNAVAILABLE until the job market has moved on. The hiring cost of any of the workers is the cost on the right side of their row, but it is modified by the value on the action itself. A + in green means a discount. A – in red means an added cost. After paying the cost, place the worker tile in the worker section of your player board onto the leftmost free space of its type. Each player starts with one worker of each of the three types on their board. If the space on which you placed the hired worker depicts an immediate action, you MUST choose to either perform the action IMMEDIATELY OR FORFEIT IT. If the row is already full, you CANNOT hire another worker of that type. At the end of the game, every worker placed on the 5th or 6th space is worth 4 VP. Buying from the Cattle Market When you perform this action, you can acquire new cattle cards from the cattle market and place them face-up on your discard pile. However, the number of cards you can buy depends on how many cowboys you have and how much money you want to spend. You don’t SPEND cowboys, you USE them. The amount of cowboys used will tell you your purchase options at the bottom of the board. EACH cowboy can ONLY be used ONCE during this action. For example: If you use just one cowboy, you can either buy one 3-value card for $6 OR buy one 4-value card for $12. You can ONLY buy cattle cards that are available and can ALWAYS choose to buy fewer cards than allowed. Any cowboy that you do NOT put to use to buy cattle cards MAY instead be used to draw 2 cards from the market cattle stack and be added face-up to the cattle market. You MAY do this at ANY given moment when performing the action. Simmental variant – you can also use 1 cowboy to buy one stage 1 Simmental for $8 or use 2 cowboys to buy one stage 1 Simmental for $5. Movement on the Railroad Track With this action, you may move your engine up to as many spaces FORWARD on the railroad track as you have engineers in your engineer row. Whenever you move your engine, you SKIP over spaces with other engines as NO two engines can occupy the SAME space. Along the track, there are several turnout spaces with train stations. Each turnout space COUNTS as an additional space. You MAY move your engine less spaces than allowed (but MUST move at LEAST 1), however once you stop, you forfeit any additional movement. If you stop on a turnout space, you MUST IMMEDIATELY decide if you are going to upgrade the station. You can only upgrade a station if you have not upgraded it before (your disc isn’t already there). To upgrade the station, pay the upgrade cost and place one of your discs on the station space. Again, you must follow the rules for disc placement as for delivery – WHITE can go on any one, DARK can only go on DARK. After you place your disc, you may take a station master tile there by taking any hired worker from the rightmost space of your player board and placing it there. You can ONLY choose to do this at the moment you are upgrading the station, NOT later. If you remove a worker from your board uncovering an immediate action, you CAN perform that action again the next time you hire a worker onto that space. Once its placed on the station, it remains there for the rest of the game. Each station master tile has two parts. The top half is an immediate action (performed IMMEDIATELY or forfeited) or permanent certificate. The bottom half is a unique way to score more VP at game end. The last space of the railroad track is special. If your engine reaches the last space, its movement ends there (potentially upgrading the station as usual). Then you must move your engine BACKWARDS at LEAST one space and you MAY move it to ANY free space on the track, INCLUDING a turnout space. After doing so, immediately gain $3. If you moved to a turnout space, you MAY IMMEDIATELY upgrade it as usual (even using the money you JUST received). If you ever need to move your engine backwards a certain amount of spaces, you MUST move it the full amount, even going into a turnout space. Objective Cards When you gain an objective card, EITHER choose one from the face-up display OR take one from the top of the deck, placing it in your discard pile. If you take one from the display, IMMEDIATELY fill the vacant space, EVEN if you have unlocked multiple city spaces giving you two of them! During your turn, if you happen to have one or more objective cards in your hand, you can play any of them, either before Phase A or before or after performing any one action in Phase B. When played, place it face-up in your personal objective area, THEN perform the immediate action in the card’s upper left corner or forfeit it. Each objective card depicts a combination of tasks to be fulfilled at the END OF THE GAME. If all are fulfilled, then you gain the VP. If they are NOT fulfilled, then you lose the negative VP printed on it. IMPORTANT – EACH SINGLE task can ONLY count towards ONE objective card – NO double-dipping on objective cards. Station master bonuses are INDEPENDENT from objective cards. You are NOT required to play your objective cards. If you want, you can keep some or all of them in your deck without committing to them during the game, though they will clog your deck. At the end of the game, you will have the option to pull these objective cards from your deck to score them or not and suffer no penalty. Place one of your private buildings When you perform this action, choose ONE of the private buildings above your player board. EITHER place it onto ANY empty building space on the trail OR use it to replace one of your private buildings already placed. You CANNOT flip the tile from the side chosen at setup. You MUST have enough builders AND be able to pay the building cost. In its upper left corner, each building tile shows the minimum number of builders that you must have to place the building. For EACH builder needed, you MUST pay $2. You can use this action to replace one of your buildings, with a HIGHER valued building. For this, you only need to have the DIFFERENCE of builders between the two buildings and must only pay the difference as well. Then replace the old building with the new one, REMOVING the old one from the game. This is the ONLY way to place buildings that require more than 6 workers. If you replace a building with your herder on it, you do NOT get to immediately use the new building. Perform single/double auxiliary actions Whenever you use a single auxiliary action, you ONLY get its benefit ONCE, even if both spaces are cleared. You MAY use an auxiliary actions with both spaces cleared as a single. Whenever you use a double auxiliary action, you can ONLY choose an auxiliary action that has both spaces cleared, gaining double the reward. You CAN use this to only do a single auxiliary action. If you ever need to move your engine backwards on the train track, you MUST move the full number of spaces. Collect bounty for outlaws When you perform this action, you can remove ONE outlaw tile of your choice from the outlaw section and place it in front of you for potential game end VP. Depending on the money value above the outlaw tile, you will either receive or pay money to the bank. If the outlaw section is empty, you CANNOT get a tile. If there is a herder on a removed tile, it stays there. Gain an exchange token When you perform this action, gain ONE exchange token from the bank. You can use one OR MORE of them at ANY point, even when it isn’t your turn. To use an exchange token, place it back in the bank, then draw 2 cards from your personal draw stack and IMMEDIATELY discard as many cards as you drew. Removing a Hazard When you remove a hazard tile, you can remove ONE hazard tile of your choice and place it in front of you for game end VP. If the icon shows a cost, you MUST IMMEDIATELY pay that cost or you cannot take the tile. If all three hazard sections are empty, you CANNOT get a tile. If there is a herder on a removed tile, it stays there. Move your herder forward This action lets you move your herder to another location along the trail. If you do, you MUST move at least 1 step and CANNOT move it more steps than indicated. On the location you stop, you MUST then perform all of phase B again. You DO NOT replenish your hand cards before performing this phase B again – ONLY at the end of your turn. GAME END The game end is triggered when a player places a worker tile onto the LAST space of the job market during subphase 2 or 3 in Kansas City. When the job market token crosses over the green arrow, that player takes the token (worth 2 VP at game end). This is that player’s LAST turn. Then, EACH OTHER player has ONE final turn. Worker tiles CANNOT be chosen to be placed from the foresight spaces during these last turns by anyone reaching Kansas City. After the last player has finished their final turn, the game ends. FINAL SCORING Players score as follows: 1 – 1 VP per $5 on hand 2 – VP from private buildings on the board 3 – VP total from city spaces with their disc 4 – VP total from train stations with their disc 5 – VP from hazard tiles collected 6 – VP from cattle cards in deck, hand, and discard pile 7 – VP from objective cards on the table, pulling any still in their deck that they want to score 8 – VP from individual tasks at the bottoms of any station master tiles – again, these items can independently be items used for objective cards as well 9 – 4 VP for each worker placed on the 5th or 6th space of any row in their worker section 10 – 3 VP for the appropriate space cleared from their player board 11 – 2 VP for the job market token Most VP wins the game and there is NO TIE-BREAKER](https://asim.sh/</@lab391/s/112086/create-player-aid-for-great-western-trail-2nd>)\\n[![khusan_ss](https://s.asim.sh/images/default-user.jpg)@khusan_ss](https://asim.sh/</@khusan_ss>)[![An app called AI Got It where AI names certain things, and user should picture it and upload.

For your first\\ngame, place them in letter order \\\\(A-G\\\\). You can also place\\nthem randomly once you’re comfortable with the game.\\n- Place the job market token on the top dashed round space in\\nthe job market.\\n- Take the 54 worker tiles, the 22 outlaw tiles, and the 18\\nhazard tiles and sort them back their backs \\\\(1 / 2 / 3\\\\). Then\\nplace them in their corresponding bags near Kansas City to\\nform the Kansas City supply.\\n- From the Kansas City supply, draw 7 tiles from the 1 bag and\\nplace them one after another on the game board. If it is an\\noutlaw tile \\\\(green or orange\\\\), place it in the outlaw section on\\nthe lowest, empty numbered space. If it is a hazard tile, place\\nit in the corresponding hazard section on the lowest, empty\\nnumbered space. If there is no empty space left, return it to\\nthe bag and draw a new tile.\\n- Start drawing tiles with from the 2 bag. Place these workers\\none after the other on the job market as follows: Start in the\\ntop row and place the first on the space based on player count.\\nPlace the next to the right and continue like this. Once the top\\nrow is full, go to the next row \\\\(starting at the player count\\nspace\\\\) until you place onto the space to the left of the job\\ntoken. Depending on player count, there will be 3, 5, or 7\\nworker tiles placed.\\n- Now fill the 6 foresight spaces in Kansas City with tiles from\\nthe supply – 2 from the 1 bag under the 1, 2 from the 2 bag\\nunder the 2, and 2 from the 3 bag under the 3.\\n- Shuffle the 36 market cattle cards and place them as a face-\\ndown market cattle stack beneath the lower left of the board.\\nDraw 7 / 10 / 13 cards for 2 / 3 / 4 players. Sort them by color\\nat the bottom of the board.\\n- The orange Simmental cow variant – add all 8 stage 1\\nSimmental cows to the 36 market cattle cards and shuffle.\\nPlace the Simmental market tile on the game board on its\\nspace. Instead of the above, draw 9 / 12 / 15 cards for 2 / 3 /\\n4 players. Sort them by color at the bottom of the board,\\nwith the Simmental cows to the very left. Take the stage 2\\nand stage 3 Simmental cows and place them near the board.\\n- Shuffle the 24 objective cards and place them as a face-down\\nstack to the right of the board. Then reveal 4 cards from the\\nstack and display them face up as the general objective\\ndisplay.\\n- Place the coins and exchange tokens within reach of the\\nplayers as the bank.\\n- Each player chooses a color and gets a player board and a\\nplayer count tile \\\\(with 2-3p. Turn it to the appropriate side\\nand use it to cover Phase A on your player board.\\n- Each player receives 12 private building tiles in their color.\\nEveryone plays with the same side of buildings – so all As or all\\nBs. Once you know the game, you can play with a mix of As\\nand Bs, but everyone still uses the same buildings – if 1B is\\nchosen, then EVERYONE uses 1B.\\n- Each player gets 14 discs \\\\(to cover the colored disc spaces on\\nthe player board\\\\), 1 engine \\\\(placed on the red building near\\nthe track\\\\), 1 certificate marker \\\\(placed on the 0 space of the\\ncertificate track, and 1 herder in their color.\\n- Each player gets 14 player cattle cards in their color \\\\(shown\\non the star\\\\) to make their herd deck.\\n- Shuffle the 4 starting objective cards and deal one at random\\nto each player, which they place face-up in their personal\\nobjective area. Return any remaining starting objectives to the\\nbox.\\n- Determine a start player and give them $6, 4 cards, 1\\nexchange token. Subsequent players get $7, 5 cards, 1\\nexchange token / $8, 6 cards, 1 exchange token / $9, 7 cards, 1\\nexchange token for 2nd / 3rd / 4th player.\\n- Before the first turn of the game, EVERYONE discards down\\nto 4 cards in their starting hand, placing discards in each\\nplayer’s personal discard pile.\\n- Each player then places their herder onto ANY neutral\\nbuilding tile AND CONTINUES TO PHASE B, AS NORMAL.\\nPlayers CAN start at the same building.\\nObject of the Game\\nThe game is played over a number of rounds. Players will\\nmove their herder along the trail to gain victory points \\\\(VP\\\\) by\\nplacing private buildings, buying cattle from the market,\\nupgrading stations, and removing hazards. Each time your\\nherder reaches Kansas City, you send your cattle off to possibly\\ngain VP, then return to the beginning of the trail to start again.\\nALL VP are awarded at the end of the game.\\nYour herd deck is reshuffled ONLY when you need to draw\\nagain. At certain locations, you can discard cattle cards for\\nrewards and when you reach Kansas City, you want as many\\ndifferent types of cattle to get more VP.\\nGAMEPLAY\\nThe game is played with each player playing the following 3\\nphases, before moving to the next clockwise player.\\nA – Move your herder to another location on the trail\\nB – Use the action\\\\(s\\\\) of your reached location\\nC – Draw up to your hand limit\\nPHASE A – MOVE YOUR HERDER TO A LOCATION\\n- A location is ANY tile on a space of the trail. Spaces\\nWITHOUT a tile are NOT locations.\\n- Your herder’s movement is measured in steps. Each location\\nis 1 step.\\n- Your herder MUST move at LEAST 1 step up to their step limit\\n\\\\(3 or 4, depending on player count\\\\), which can be increased\\nlater in the game.\\n- You MUST ALWAYS move your herder FORWARD along the\\ntrail, following the arrows and may choose either path when it\\nforks.\\n- The location where your herder ends their movement is the\\nlocation you will use in Phase B.\\n- You are NOT allowed to pass OVER Kansas City. Once you\\nreach Kansas City, your herder ends its movement there.\\n- Multiple players’ herders can share a location.\\nIMPORTANT – Several locations show a green or black hand\\n\\\\(or BOTH\\\\). If your herder moves to or passes over such a\\nlocation, you MUST pay a fee.\\nIf it’s a hazard/outlaw, the fee is paid to the BANK. If it’s\\nanother player’s private building, the fee is paid to that\\nPLAYER.\\nThe fee depends on player count. In a 2p game, each hand is\\n$2. In a 3p game, green hands cost $2 and black hands cost\\n$1. In a 4p game, green hands cost $1 and black hands cost\\n$2.\\nIMPORTANT – Even if you cannot pay some or all of the\\nhands along your path, you are STILL ALLOWED to move. You\\npay what you can and continue moving. Inability to pay hand\\nfees DOES NOT stop your movement. This ONLY applies to\\nhand fees. ANY OTHER costs/requirements in the game\\nMUST ALWAYS be paid/met in full.\\nPHASE B – USE THE ACTION OF YOUR REACHED LOCATION\\nAfter moving your herder, use the location where you ended\\nyour movement. Your options vary depending on whether it\\nis:\\n• A neutral building or YOUR private building\\n• ANOTHER player’s private building, hazard, or outlaw.\\n• Kansas City\\na. – On a neutral building or YOUR private building, you have\\ntwo options – use the local action\\\\(s\\\\) of the tile OR use ONE\\nsingle auxiliary action.\\nIf you choose to use the tiles local actions, you MAY perform\\nEACH of the tile’s local actions ONCE and MAY perform them\\nin ANY order.\\nYou do NOT have to perform ALL of the available actions, but if\\nthere is a cost/requirement, you MUST pay/meet it in full to\\ngain the reward.\\nActions separated by a white slash are either/or NOT both.\\nSpaces separated by full-length straight lines ARE both/all.\\nSome spaces of the trail have risk actions attached. If a\\nbuilding tile is placed on such a space, the risk action becomes\\npart of that building tile’s local actions and can be performed\\nby its OWNER each time that player reaches that location.\\nIf you do NOT perform ANY of the tile’s local actions, then you\\nMAY perform ONE single auxiliary action instead. Auxiliary\\nactions are on the left of your player board. Initially, you only\\nhave two of them available.\\nb. – On another player’s building tile, hazard, or outlaw tile,\\nyou have ONLY ONE option – performing ONE single auxiliary\\naction.\\nc. – When you reach Kansas City, you MUST carry out ALL 5\\nKansas City subphases IN ORDER. They are:\\n1 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 1 and\\nmove it to its corresponding section.\\n2 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 2 and\\nmove it to its corresponding section.\\n3 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 3 and\\nmove it to its corresponding section.\\n4 – Reveal your ENTIRE hand, calculate your income\\nfrom the bank, then discard your ENTIRE hand to\\nyour discard pile.\\n5 – Move one of your player discs from your player\\nboard onto a city crest and pay ANY transport costs.\\n\\\\(1-2-3\\\\) Each of the 3 tiles in subphases 1, 2, and 3 must\\nIMMEDIATELY be moved to its corresponding section to the\\nlowest available space. If no space is available, take the tile\\nout of the game and return it to the box.\\nIf it is an outlaw tile \\\\(green or orange\\\\), place it in the outlaw\\nsection onto the empty space with the lowest number. If no\\nempty space is left there, take the tile out of the game.\\nIf it is a hazard tile \\\\(flood, drought, or rockfall\\\\), place it in the\\ncorresponding section onto the empty space with the lowest\\nnumber. If no empty space is left there, take the tile out of the\\ngame.\\nIf it is a worker tile, it MUST be placed in the next free space of\\nthe job market – starting with the row with the job market\\ntoken.\\nAs soon as you need to place a worker tile on the job market\\ntoken space, slide the job market token down to the dashed\\nround space of the next row.\\nIf the job market token crosses over a yellow arrow, you\\nIMMEDIATELY fill up the cattle market, bringing the cattle\\nmarket back up to 7 / 10 / 13 cards \\\\(or 9 / 12 / 15 with\\nSimmental variant\\\\) for 2 / 3 / 4 players.\\nIf you need to refill the cattle market and the total cards there\\nare already equal to or higher than the amount, do NOT add\\nany cards.\\nIf the cattle market stack is empty, no more cards are added to\\nthe cattle market.\\nIf the job market token moves over the green arrow at the\\nbottom, the game end is triggered.\\n\\\\(4 – Income\\\\) Reveal your ENTIRE hand and calculate its\\nbreeding value. To do this, add the breeding values of each\\nDIFFERENT TYPE of cattle in your hand. Each type is ONLY\\ncounted ONCE.\\nThen, if possible, you MAY increase the total breeding value by\\nadding certificates \\\\(temporary or permanent\\\\) to it. Temporary\\ncertificates are those on your certificate track and you add\\nthem by moving your marker back. Permanent certificates are\\nthose on the upper half of any station master tiles in front of\\nyou, permanently increasing your breeding value for the rest\\nof the game.\\nOnce your breeding value is set, take that many dollars from\\nthe bank, placing it aside to track your breeding value for\\nsubphase 5. Simmental variant – AFTER setting your breeding\\nvalue, if you have any stage 1 Simmental cattle cards in your\\nhand, you may remove them from the game and take the\\nsame number of stage 2 Simmental cattle cards and place\\nthem on your discard pile. If you have any stage 2 Simmental\\ncattle cards in your hand, you may remove them from the\\ngame and take the same number of stage 3 Simmental cattle\\ncards and place them on your discard pile. THESE DO NOT\\nINCREASE YOUR JUST CALCULATED BREEDING VALUE.\\nWhen calculating your breeding value, you can ONLY add\\nONE of your Simmental cattle cards REGARDLESS of stage.\\nIf an action requires you to discard a cattle card of a certain\\nbreeding value, but the icon DOES NOT include orange cattle\\ncards, you CANNOT discard a Simmental cattle card.\\nThen, discard ALL cards from your hand.\\n\\\\(5 – Delivery\\\\) Pick a city whose city value is equal to or less\\nthan your breeding value. You CANNOT pick a city that you\\nhave already delivered to before, EXCEPT for the local city –\\nKansas City – and the terminal city – New York.\\nOnce you have chosen a city, place one of your player discs\\nfrom your board onto the city space.\\nA disc taken from a WHITE-cornered space on your board can\\nbe placed onto ANY city space. A disc taken from a DARK-\\ncornered space can ONLY be placed onto a DARK-cornered city\\nspace.\\nBy clearing a disc space on your board, you unlock an ability.\\nSome disc spaces give an additional reward or have an added\\ncost for clearing them.\\nBy placing your disc onto a city space, you may gain or lose VP\\nat the end of the game and may trigger delivery actions that\\nyou MUST perform IMMEDIATELY. The action in any of the\\ngreen arrows is NOT triggered until BOTH city spaces have one\\nof your discs. This also goes for VP at game end.\\nEXCEPTION – if you have NO MORE WHITE-CORNERED discs\\non your board and have to place one, you MAY take a DARK-\\nCORNERED ONE!\\nFinally, check if there are any transport costs based on how\\nmany RED Xs are between the nose of your engine and the city\\ncrest to which you are delivering. Pay $1 for each of them and\\nthis payment MAY come from the money you just received for\\ndelivering.\\nAfter finishing the Delivery subphase, move your herder to the\\nhorseman space at the beginning of the trail and refill the\\nempty foresight spaces with the appropriate tiles from the\\nmatching numbered bag.\\nPHASE C – DRAW UP TO YOUR HAND LIMIT\\nEach player starts with a hand limit of 4 and can increase it up\\nto 6. If you have fewer cards in hand than your hand limit,\\ndraw cards from your personal draw pile to equal your hand\\nlimit, shuffling your discards as necessary. Once this phase is\\ncomplete, it is the next player’s turn.\\nHire One Worker\\nWhen you perform this action, choose exactly ONE worker tile\\nfrom the job market, pay the cost and place that tile in the\\nworker section of your player board.\\nYou CANNOT hire a worker from the row where the job\\nmarket token is CURRENTLY located. Those workers are\\nUNAVAILABLE until the job market has moved on.\\nThe hiring cost of any of the workers is the cost on the right\\nside of their row, but it is modified by the value on the action\\nitself. A + in green means a discount. A – in red means an\\nadded cost.\\nAfter paying the cost, place the worker tile in the worker\\nsection of your player board onto the leftmost free space of its\\ntype. Each player starts with one worker of each of the three\\ntypes on their board.\\nIf the space on which you placed the hired worker depicts an\\nimmediate action, you MUST choose to either perform the\\naction IMMEDIATELY OR FORFEIT IT.\\nIf the row is already full, you CANNOT hire another worker of\\nthat type. At the end of the game, every worker placed on the\\n5th or 6th space is worth 4 VP.\\nBuying from the Cattle Market\\nWhen you perform this action, you can acquire new cattle\\ncards from the cattle market and place them face-up on your\\ndiscard pile. However, the number of cards you can buy\\ndepends on how many cowboys you have and how much\\nmoney you want to spend.\\nYou don’t SPEND cowboys, you USE them. The amount of\\ncowboys used will tell you your purchase options at the\\nbottom of the board. EACH cowboy can ONLY be used ONCE\\nduring this action.\\nFor example: If you use just one cowboy, you can either buy\\none 3-value card for $6 OR buy one 4-value card for $12. You\\ncan ONLY buy cattle cards that are available and can ALWAYS\\nchoose to buy fewer cards than allowed.\\nAny cowboy that you do NOT put to use to buy cattle cards\\nMAY instead be used to draw 2 cards from the market cattle\\nstack and be added face-up to the cattle market. You MAY do\\nthis at ANY given moment when performing the action.\\nSimmental variant – you can also use 1 cowboy to buy one\\nstage 1 Simmental for $8 or use 2 cowboys to buy one stage 1\\nSimmental for $5.\\nMovement on the Railroad Track\\nWith this action, you may move your engine up to as many\\nspaces FORWARD on the railroad track as you have engineers\\nin your engineer row.\\nWhenever you move your engine, you SKIP over spaces with\\nother engines as NO two engines can occupy the SAME space.\\nAlong the track, there are several turnout spaces with train\\nstations. Each turnout space COUNTS as an additional space.\\nYou MAY move your engine less spaces than allowed \\\\(but\\nMUST move at LEAST 1\\\\), however once you stop, you forfeit\\nany additional movement.\\nIf you stop on a turnout space, you MUST IMMEDIATELY\\ndecide if you are going to upgrade the station. You can only\\nupgrade a station if you have not upgraded it before \\\\(your disc\\nisn’t already there\\\\).\\nTo upgrade the station, pay the upgrade cost and place one of\\nyour discs on the station space. Again, you must follow the\\nrules for disc placement as for delivery – WHITE can go on any\\none, DARK can only go on DARK.\\nAfter you place your disc, you may take a station master tile\\nthere by taking any hired worker from the rightmost space of\\nyour player board and placing it there.\\nYou can ONLY choose to do this at the moment you are\\nupgrading the station, NOT later.\\nIf you remove a worker from your board uncovering an\\nimmediate action, you CAN perform that action again the next\\ntime you hire a worker onto that space. Once its placed on the\\nstation, it remains there for the rest of the game.\\nEach station master tile has two parts. The top half is an\\nimmediate action \\\\(performed IMMEDIATELY or forfeited\\\\) or\\npermanent certificate. The bottom half is a unique way to\\nscore more VP at game end.\\nThe last space of the railroad track is special. If your engine\\nreaches the last space, its movement ends there \\\\(potentially\\nupgrading the station as usual\\\\). Then you must move your\\nengine BACKWARDS at LEAST one space and you MAY move it\\nto ANY free space on the track, INCLUDING a turnout space.\\nAfter doing so, immediately gain $3. If you moved to a turnout\\nspace, you MAY IMMEDIATELY upgrade it as usual \\\\(even using\\nthe money you JUST received\\\\).\\nIf you ever need to move your engine backwards a certain\\namount of spaces, you MUST move it the full amount, even\\ngoing into a turnout space.\\nObjective Cards\\nWhen you gain an objective card, EITHER choose one from the\\nface-up display OR take one from the top of the deck, placing\\nit in your discard pile. If you take one from the display,\\nIMMEDIATELY fill the vacant space, EVEN if you have\\nunlocked multiple city spaces giving you two of them!\\nDuring your turn, if you happen to have one or more objective\\ncards in your hand, you can play any of them, either before\\nPhase A or before or after performing any one action in Phase\\nB.\\nWhen played, place it face-up in your personal objective area,\\nTHEN perform the immediate action in the card’s upper left\\ncorner or forfeit it.\\nEach objective card depicts a combination of tasks to be\\nfulfilled at the END OF THE GAME. If all are fulfilled, then you\\ngain the VP. If they are NOT fulfilled, then you lose the\\nnegative VP printed on it.\\nIMPORTANT – EACH SINGLE task can ONLY count towards\\nONE objective card – NO double-dipping on objective cards.\\nStation master bonuses are INDEPENDENT from objective\\ncards.\\nYou are NOT required to play your objective cards. If you\\nwant, you can keep some or all of them in your deck without\\ncommitting to them during the game, though they will clog\\nyour deck. At the end of the game, you will have the option to\\npull these objective cards from your deck to score them or not\\nand suffer no penalty.\\nPlace one of your private buildings\\nWhen you perform this action, choose ONE of the private\\nbuildings above your player board. EITHER place it onto ANY\\nempty building space on the trail OR use it to replace one of\\nyour private buildings already placed.\\nYou CANNOT flip the tile from the side chosen at setup.\\nYou MUST have enough builders AND be able to pay the\\nbuilding cost.\\nIn its upper left corner, each building tile shows the minimum\\nnumber of builders that you must have to place the building.\\nFor EACH builder needed, you MUST pay $2.\\nYou can use this action to replace one of your buildings, with a\\nHIGHER valued building. For this, you only need to have the\\nDIFFERENCE of builders between the two buildings and must\\nonly pay the difference as well. Then replace the old building\\nwith the new one, REMOVING the old one from the game.\\nThis is the ONLY way to place buildings that require more than\\n6 workers.\\nIf you replace a building with your herder on it, you do NOT\\nget to immediately use the new building.\\nPerform single/double auxiliary actions\\nWhenever you use a single auxiliary action, you ONLY get its\\nbenefit ONCE, even if both spaces are cleared. You MAY use\\nan auxiliary actions with both spaces cleared as a single.\\nWhenever you use a double auxiliary action, you can ONLY\\nchoose an auxiliary action that has both spaces cleared,\\ngaining double the reward. You CAN use this to only do a\\nsingle auxiliary action.\\nIf you ever need to move your engine backwards on the train\\ntrack, you MUST move the full number of spaces.\\nCollect bounty for outlaws\\nWhen you perform this action, you can remove ONE outlaw\\ntile of your choice from the outlaw section and place it in front\\nof you for potential game end VP. Depending on the money\\nvalue above the outlaw tile, you will either receive or pay\\nmoney to the bank.\\nIf the outlaw section is empty, you CANNOT get a tile. If there\\nis a herder on a removed tile, it stays there.\\nGain an exchange token\\nWhen you perform this action, gain ONE exchange token from\\nthe bank.\\nYou can use one OR MORE of them at ANY point, even when it\\nisn’t your turn. To use an exchange token, place it back in the\\nbank, then draw 2 cards from your personal draw stack and\\nIMMEDIATELY discard as many cards as you drew.\\nRemoving a Hazard\\nWhen you remove a hazard tile, you can remove ONE hazard\\ntile of your choice and place it in front of you for game end VP.\\nIf the icon shows a cost, you MUST IMMEDIATELY pay that\\ncost or you cannot take the tile.\\nIf all three hazard sections are empty, you CANNOT get a tile.\\nIf there is a herder on a removed tile, it stays there.\\nMove your herder forward\\nThis action lets you move your herder to another location\\nalong the trail. If you do, you MUST move at least 1 step and\\nCANNOT move it more steps than indicated.\\nOn the location you stop, you MUST then perform all of phase\\nB again. You DO NOT replenish your hand cards before\\nperforming this phase B again – ONLY at the end of your turn.\\nGAME END\\nThe game end is triggered when a player places a worker tile\\nonto the LAST space of the job market during subphase 2 or 3\\nin Kansas City. When the job market token crosses over the\\ngreen arrow, that player takes the token \\\\(worth 2 VP at game\\nend\\\\). This is that player’s LAST turn. Then, EACH OTHER\\nplayer has ONE final turn.\\nWorker tiles CANNOT be chosen to be placed from the\\nforesight spaces during these last turns by anyone reaching\\nKansas City.\\nAfter the last player has finished their final turn, the game\\nends.\\nFINAL SCORING\\nPlayers score as follows:\\n1 – 1 VP per $5 on hand\\n2 – VP from private buildings on the board\\n3 – VP total from city spaces with their disc\\n4 – VP total from train stations with their disc\\n5 – VP from hazard tiles collected\\n6 – VP from cattle cards in deck, hand, and discard pile\\n7 – VP from objective cards on the table, pulling any still in\\ntheir deck that they want to score\\n8 – VP from individual tasks at the bottoms of any station\\nmaster tiles – again, these items can independently be\\nitems used for objective cards as well\\n9 – 4 VP for each worker placed on the 5th or 6th space of\\nany row in their worker section\\n10 – 3 VP for the appropriate space cleared from their\\nplayer board\\n11 – 2 VP for the job market token\\nMost VP wins the game and there is NO TIE-BREAKER⟨71⟩3100Create player aid for Great Western Trail: 2nd Edition. Guide to Great Western Trail 2nd Edition SET-UP - Shuffle the 9 station master tiles and place one randomly onto each of the 5 station master spaces. - Take the 7 neutral building tiles and place one onto each of the 7 neutral building spaces on the board. For your first game, place them in letter order (A-G). You can also place them randomly once you’re comfortable with the game. - Place the job market token on the top dashed round space in the job market. - Take the 54 worker tiles, the 22 outlaw tiles, and the 18 hazard tiles and sort them back their backs (1 / 2 / 3). Then place them in their corresponding bags near Kansas City to form the Kansas City supply. - From the Kansas City supply, draw 7 tiles from the 1 bag and place them one after another on the game board. If it is an outlaw tile (green or orange), place it in the outlaw section on the lowest, empty numbered space. If it is a hazard tile, place it in the corresponding hazard section on the lowest, empty numbered space. If there is no empty space left, return it to the bag and draw a new tile. - Start drawing tiles with from the 2 bag. Place these workers one after the other on the job market as follows: Start in the top row and place the first on the space based on player count. Place the next to the right and continue like this. Once the top row is full, go to the next row (starting at the player count space) until you place onto the space to the left of the job token. Depending on player count, there will be 3, 5, or 7 worker tiles placed. - Now fill the 6 foresight spaces in Kansas City with tiles from the supply – 2 from the 1 bag under the 1, 2 from the 2 bag under the 2, and 2 from the 3 bag under the 3. - Shuffle the 36 market cattle cards and place them as a face- down market cattle stack beneath the lower left of the board. Draw 7 / 10 / 13 cards for 2 / 3 / 4 players. Sort them by color at the bottom of the board. - The orange Simmental cow variant – add all 8 stage 1 Simmental cows to the 36 market cattle cards and shuffle. Place the Simmental market tile on the game board on its space. Instead of the above, draw 9 / 12 / 15 cards for 2 / 3 / 4 players. Sort them by color at the bottom of the board, with the Simmental cows to the very left. Take the stage 2 and stage 3 Simmental cows and place them near the board. - Shuffle the 24 objective cards and place them as a face-down stack to the right of the board. Then reveal 4 cards from the stack and display them face up as the general objective display. - Place the coins and exchange tokens within reach of the players as the bank. - Each player chooses a color and gets a player board and a player count tile (with 2-3p. Turn it to the appropriate side and use it to cover Phase A on your player board. - Each player receives 12 private building tiles in their color. Everyone plays with the same side of buildings – so all As or all Bs. Once you know the game, you can play with a mix of As and Bs, but everyone still uses the same buildings – if 1B is chosen, then EVERYONE uses 1B. - Each player gets 14 discs (to cover the colored disc spaces on the player board), 1 engine (placed on the red building near the track), 1 certificate marker (placed on the 0 space of the certificate track, and 1 herder in their color. - Each player gets 14 player cattle cards in their color (shown on the star) to make their herd deck. - Shuffle the 4 starting objective cards and deal one at random to each player, which they place face-up in their personal objective area. Return any remaining starting objectives to the box. - Determine a start player and give them $6, 4 cards, 1 exchange token. Subsequent players get $7, 5 cards, 1 exchange token / $8, 6 cards, 1 exchange token / $9, 7 cards, 1 exchange token for 2nd / 3rd / 4th player. - Before the first turn of the game, EVERYONE discards down to 4 cards in their starting hand, placing discards in each player’s personal discard pile. - Each player then places their herder onto ANY neutral building tile AND CONTINUES TO PHASE B, AS NORMAL. Players CAN start at the same building. Object of the Game The game is played over a number of rounds. Players will move their herder along the trail to gain victory points (VP) by placing private buildings, buying cattle from the market, upgrading stations, and removing hazards. Each time your herder reaches Kansas City, you send your cattle off to possibly gain VP, then return to the beginning of the trail to start again. ALL VP are awarded at the end of the game. Your herd deck is reshuffled ONLY when you need to draw again. At certain locations, you can discard cattle cards for rewards and when you reach Kansas City, you want as many different types of cattle to get more VP. GAMEPLAY The game is played with each player playing the following 3 phases, before moving to the next clockwise player. A – Move your herder to another location on the trail B – Use the action(s) of your reached location C – Draw up to your hand limit PHASE A – MOVE YOUR HERDER TO A LOCATION - A location is ANY tile on a space of the trail. Spaces WITHOUT a tile are NOT locations. - Your herder’s movement is measured in steps. Each location is 1 step. - Your herder MUST move at LEAST 1 step up to their step limit (3 or 4, depending on player count), which can be increased later in the game. - You MUST ALWAYS move your herder FORWARD along the trail, following the arrows and may choose either path when it forks. - The location where your herder ends their movement is the location you will use in Phase B. - You are NOT allowed to pass OVER Kansas City. Once you reach Kansas City, your herder ends its movement there. - Multiple players’ herders can share a location. IMPORTANT – Several locations show a green or black hand (or BOTH). If your herder moves to or passes over such a location, you MUST pay a fee. If it’s a hazard/outlaw, the fee is paid to the BANK. If it’s another player’s private building, the fee is paid to that PLAYER. The fee depends on player count. In a 2p game, each hand is $2. In a 3p game, green hands cost $2 and black hands cost $1. In a 4p game, green hands cost $1 and black hands cost $2. IMPORTANT – Even if you cannot pay some or all of the hands along your path, you are STILL ALLOWED to move. You pay what you can and continue moving. Inability to pay hand fees DOES NOT stop your movement. This ONLY applies to hand fees. ANY OTHER costs/requirements in the game MUST ALWAYS be paid/met in full. PHASE B – USE THE ACTION OF YOUR REACHED LOCATION After moving your herder, use the location where you ended your movement. Your options vary depending on whether it is: • A neutral building or YOUR private building • ANOTHER player’s private building, hazard, or outlaw. • Kansas City a. – On a neutral building or YOUR private building, you have two options – use the local action(s) of the tile OR use ONE single auxiliary action. If you choose to use the tiles local actions, you MAY perform EACH of the tile’s local actions ONCE and MAY perform them in ANY order. You do NOT have to perform ALL of the available actions, but if there is a cost/requirement, you MUST pay/meet it in full to gain the reward. Actions separated by a white slash are either/or NOT both. Spaces separated by full-length straight lines ARE both/all. Some spaces of the trail have risk actions attached. If a building tile is placed on such a space, the risk action becomes part of that building tile’s local actions and can be performed by its OWNER each time that player reaches that location. If you do NOT perform ANY of the tile’s local actions, then you MAY perform ONE single auxiliary action instead. Auxiliary actions are on the left of your player board. Initially, you only have two of them available. b. – On another player’s building tile, hazard, or outlaw tile, you have ONLY ONE option – performing ONE single auxiliary action. c. – When you reach Kansas City, you MUST carry out ALL 5 Kansas City subphases IN ORDER. They are: 1 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 1 and move it to its corresponding section. 2 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 2 and move it to its corresponding section. 3 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 3 and move it to its corresponding section. 4 – Reveal your ENTIRE hand, calculate your income from the bank, then discard your ENTIRE hand to your discard pile. 5 – Move one of your player discs from your player board onto a city crest and pay ANY transport costs. (1-2-3) Each of the 3 tiles in subphases 1, 2, and 3 must IMMEDIATELY be moved to its corresponding section to the lowest available space. If no space is available, take the tile out of the game and return it to the box. If it is an outlaw tile (green or orange), place it in the outlaw section onto the empty space with the lowest number. If no empty space is left there, take the tile out of the game. If it is a hazard tile (flood, drought, or rockfall), place it in the corresponding section onto the empty space with the lowest number. If no empty space is left there, take the tile out of the game. If it is a worker tile, it MUST be placed in the next free space of the job market – starting with the row with the job market token. As soon as you need to place a worker tile on the job market token space, slide the job market token down to the dashed round space of the next row. If the job market token crosses over a yellow arrow, you IMMEDIATELY fill up the cattle market, bringing the cattle market back up to 7 / 10 / 13 cards (or 9 / 12 / 15 with Simmental variant) for 2 / 3 / 4 players. If you need to refill the cattle market and the total cards there are already equal to or higher than the amount, do NOT add any cards. If the cattle market stack is empty, no more cards are added to the cattle market. If the job market token moves over the green arrow at the bottom, the game end is triggered. (4 – Income) Reveal your ENTIRE hand and calculate its breeding value. To do this, add the breeding values of each DIFFERENT TYPE of cattle in your hand. Each type is ONLY counted ONCE. Then, if possible, you MAY increase the total breeding value by adding certificates (temporary or permanent) to it. Temporary certificates are those on your certificate track and you add them by moving your marker back. Permanent certificates are those on the upper half of any station master tiles in front of you, permanently increasing your breeding value for the rest of the game. Once your breeding value is set, take that many dollars from the bank, placing it aside to track your breeding value for subphase 5. Simmental variant – AFTER setting your breeding value, if you have any stage 1 Simmental cattle cards in your hand, you may remove them from the game and take the same number of stage 2 Simmental cattle cards and place them on your discard pile. If you have any stage 2 Simmental cattle cards in your hand, you may remove them from the game and take the same number of stage 3 Simmental cattle cards and place them on your discard pile. THESE DO NOT INCREASE YOUR JUST CALCULATED BREEDING VALUE. When calculating your breeding value, you can ONLY add ONE of your Simmental cattle cards REGARDLESS of stage. If an action requires you to discard a cattle card of a certain breeding value, but the icon DOES NOT include orange cattle cards, you CANNOT discard a Simmental cattle card. Then, discard ALL cards from your hand. (5 – Delivery) Pick a city whose city value is equal to or less than your breeding value. You CANNOT pick a city that you have already delivered to before, EXCEPT for the local city – Kansas City – and the terminal city – New York. Once you have chosen a city, place one of your player discs from your board onto the city space. A disc taken from a WHITE-cornered space on your board can be placed onto ANY city space. A disc taken from a DARK- cornered space can ONLY be placed onto a DARK-cornered city space. By clearing a disc space on your board, you unlock an ability. Some disc spaces give an additional reward or have an added cost for clearing them. By placing your disc onto a city space, you may gain or lose VP at the end of the game and may trigger delivery actions that you MUST perform IMMEDIATELY. The action in any of the green arrows is NOT triggered until BOTH city spaces have one of your discs. This also goes for VP at game end. EXCEPTION – if you have NO MORE WHITE-CORNERED discs on your board and have to place one, you MAY take a DARK- CORNERED ONE! Finally, check if there are any transport costs based on how many RED Xs are between the nose of your engine and the city crest to which you are delivering. Pay $1 for each of them and this payment MAY come from the money you just received for delivering. After finishing the Delivery subphase, move your herder to the horseman space at the beginning of the trail and refill the empty foresight spaces with the appropriate tiles from the matching numbered bag. PHASE C – DRAW UP TO YOUR HAND LIMIT Each player starts with a hand limit of 4 and can increase it up to 6. If you have fewer cards in hand than your hand limit, draw cards from your personal draw pile to equal your hand limit, shuffling your discards as necessary. Once this phase is complete, it is the next player’s turn. Hire One Worker When you perform this action, choose exactly ONE worker tile from the job market, pay the cost and place that tile in the worker section of your player board. You CANNOT hire a worker from the row where the job market token is CURRENTLY located. Those workers are UNAVAILABLE until the job market has moved on. The hiring cost of any of the workers is the cost on the right side of their row, but it is modified by the value on the action itself. A + in green means a discount. A – in red means an added cost. After paying the cost, place the worker tile in the worker section of your player board onto the leftmost free space of its type. Each player starts with one worker of each of the three types on their board. If the space on which you placed the hired worker depicts an immediate action, you MUST choose to either perform the action IMMEDIATELY OR FORFEIT IT. If the row is already full, you CANNOT hire another worker of that type. At the end of the game, every worker placed on the 5th or 6th space is worth 4 VP. Buying from the Cattle Market When you perform this action, you can acquire new cattle cards from the cattle market and place them face-up on your discard pile. However, the number of cards you can buy depends on how many cowboys you have and how much money you want to spend. You don’t SPEND cowboys, you USE them. The amount of cowboys used will tell you your purchase options at the bottom of the board. EACH cowboy can ONLY be used ONCE during this action. For example: If you use just one cowboy, you can either buy one 3-value card for $6 OR buy one 4-value card for $12. You can ONLY buy cattle cards that are available and can ALWAYS choose to buy fewer cards than allowed. Any cowboy that you do NOT put to use to buy cattle cards MAY instead be used to draw 2 cards from the market cattle stack and be added face-up to the cattle market. You MAY do this at ANY given moment when performing the action. Simmental variant – you can also use 1 cowboy to buy one stage 1 Simmental for $8 or use 2 cowboys to buy one stage 1 Simmental for $5. Movement on the Railroad Track With this action, you may move your engine up to as many spaces FORWARD on the railroad track as you have engineers in your engineer row. Whenever you move your engine, you SKIP over spaces with other engines as NO two engines can occupy the SAME space. Along the track, there are several turnout spaces with train stations. Each turnout space COUNTS as an additional space. You MAY move your engine less spaces than allowed (but MUST move at LEAST 1), however once you stop, you forfeit any additional movement. If you stop on a turnout space, you MUST IMMEDIATELY decide if you are going to upgrade the station. You can only upgrade a station if you have not upgraded it before (your disc isn’t already there). To upgrade the station, pay the upgrade cost and place one of your discs on the station space. Again, you must follow the rules for disc placement as for delivery – WHITE can go on any one, DARK can only go on DARK. After you place your disc, you may take a station master tile there by taking any hired worker from the rightmost space of your player board and placing it there. You can ONLY choose to do this at the moment you are upgrading the station, NOT later. If you remove a worker from your board uncovering an immediate action, you CAN perform that action again the next time you hire a worker onto that space. Once its placed on the station, it remains there for the rest of the game. Each station master tile has two parts. The top half is an immediate action (performed IMMEDIATELY or forfeited) or permanent certificate. The bottom half is a unique way to score more VP at game end. The last space of the railroad track is special. If your engine reaches the last space, its movement ends there (potentially upgrading the station as usual). Then you must move your engine BACKWARDS at LEAST one space and you MAY move it to ANY free space on the track, INCLUDING a turnout space. After doing so, immediately gain $3. If you moved to a turnout space, you MAY IMMEDIATELY upgrade it as usual (even using the money you JUST received). If you ever need to move your engine backwards a certain amount of spaces, you MUST move it the full amount, even going into a turnout space. Objective Cards When you gain an objective card, EITHER choose one from the face-up display OR take one from the top of the deck, placing it in your discard pile. If you take one from the display, IMMEDIATELY fill the vacant space, EVEN if you have unlocked multiple city spaces giving you two of them! During your turn, if you happen to have one or more objective cards in your hand, you can play any of them, either before Phase A or before or after performing any one action in Phase B. When played, place it face-up in your personal objective area, THEN perform the immediate action in the card’s upper left corner or forfeit it. Each objective card depicts a combination of tasks to be fulfilled at the END OF THE GAME. If all are fulfilled, then you gain the VP. If they are NOT fulfilled, then you lose the negative VP printed on it. IMPORTANT – EACH SINGLE task can ONLY count towards ONE objective card – NO double-dipping on objective cards. Station master bonuses are INDEPENDENT from objective cards. You are NOT required to play your objective cards. If you want, you can keep some or all of them in your deck without committing to them during the game, though they will clog your deck. At the end of the game, you will have the option to pull these objective cards from your deck to score them or not and suffer no penalty. Place one of your private buildings When you perform this action, choose ONE of the private buildings above your player board. EITHER place it onto ANY empty building space on the trail OR use it to replace one of your private buildings already placed. You CANNOT flip the tile from the side chosen at setup. You MUST have enough builders AND be able to pay the building cost. In its upper left corner, each building tile shows the minimum number of builders that you must have to place the building. For EACH builder needed, you MUST pay $2. You can use this action to replace one of your buildings, with a HIGHER valued building. For this, you only need to have the DIFFERENCE of builders between the two buildings and must only pay the difference as well. Then replace the old building with the new one, REMOVING the old one from the game. This is the ONLY way to place buildings that require more than 6 workers. If you replace a building with your herder on it, you do NOT get to immediately use the new building. Perform single/double auxiliary actions Whenever you use a single auxiliary action, you ONLY get its benefit ONCE, even if both spaces are cleared. You MAY use an auxiliary actions with both spaces cleared as a single. Whenever you use a double auxiliary action, you can ONLY choose an auxiliary action that has both spaces cleared, gaining double the reward. You CAN use this to only do a single auxiliary action. If you ever need to move your engine backwards on the train track, you MUST move the full number of spaces. Collect bounty for outlaws When you perform this action, you can remove ONE outlaw tile of your choice from the outlaw section and place it in front of you for potential game end VP. Depending on the money value above the outlaw tile, you will either receive or pay money to the bank. If the outlaw section is empty, you CANNOT get a tile. If there is a herder on a removed tile, it stays there. Gain an exchange token When you perform this action, gain ONE exchange token from the bank. You can use one OR MORE of them at ANY point, even when it isn’t your turn. To use an exchange token, place it back in the bank, then draw 2 cards from your personal draw stack and IMMEDIATELY discard as many cards as you drew. Removing a Hazard When you remove a hazard tile, you can remove ONE hazard tile of your choice and place it in front of you for game end VP. If the icon shows a cost, you MUST IMMEDIATELY pay that cost or you cannot take the tile. If all three hazard sections are empty, you CANNOT get a tile. If there is a herder on a removed tile, it stays there. Move your herder forward This action lets you move your herder to another location along the trail. If you do, you MUST move at least 1 step and CANNOT move it more steps than indicated. On the location you stop, you MUST then perform all of phase B again. You DO NOT replenish your hand cards before performing this phase B again – ONLY at the end of your turn. GAME END The game end is triggered when a player places a worker tile onto the LAST space of the job market during subphase 2 or 3 in Kansas City. When the job market token crosses over the green arrow, that player takes the token (worth 2 VP at game end). This is that player’s LAST turn. Then, EACH OTHER player has ONE final turn. Worker tiles CANNOT be chosen to be placed from the foresight spaces during these last turns by anyone reaching Kansas City. After the last player has finished their final turn, the game ends. FINAL SCORING Players score as follows: 1 – 1 VP per $5 on hand 2 – VP from private buildings on the board 3 – VP total from city spaces with their disc 4 – VP total from train stations with their disc 5 – VP from hazard tiles collected 6 – VP from cattle cards in deck, hand, and discard pile 7 – VP from objective cards on the table, pulling any still in their deck that they want to score 8 – VP from individual tasks at the bottoms of any station master tiles – again, these items can independently be items used for objective cards as well 9 – 4 VP for each worker placed on the 5th or 6th space of any row in their worker section 10 – 3 VP for the appropriate space cleared from their player board 11 – 2 VP for the job market token Most VP wins the game and there is NO TIE-BREAKER](https://asim.sh/</@lab391/s/112086/create-player-aid-for-great-western-trail-2nd>)\\n![khusan_ss⟨45⟩@khusan_ss](https://asim.sh/</@khusan_ss>)![An app called AI Got It where AI names certain things, and user should picture it and upload.

For your first\\ngame, place them in letter order \\\\(A-G\\\\). You can also place\\nthem randomly once you’re comfortable with the game.\\n- Place the job market token on the top dashed round space in\\nthe job market.\\n- Take the 54 worker tiles, the 22 outlaw tiles, and the 18\\nhazard tiles and sort them back their backs \\\\(1 / 2 / 3\\\\). Then\\nplace them in their corresponding bags near Kansas City to\\nform the Kansas City supply.\\n- From the Kansas City supply, draw 7 tiles from the 1 bag and\\nplace them one after another on the game board. If it is an\\noutlaw tile \\\\(green or orange\\\\), place it in the outlaw section on\\nthe lowest, empty numbered space. If it is a hazard tile, place\\nit in the corresponding hazard section on the lowest, empty\\nnumbered space. If there is no empty space left, return it to\\nthe bag and draw a new tile.\\n- Start drawing tiles with from the 2 bag. Place these workers\\none after the other on the job market as follows: Start in the\\ntop row and place the first on the space based on player count.\\nPlace the next to the right and continue like this. Once the top\\nrow is full, go to the next row \\\\(starting at the player count\\nspace\\\\) until you place onto the space to the left of the job\\ntoken. Depending on player count, there will be 3, 5, or 7\\nworker tiles placed.\\n- Now fill the 6 foresight spaces in Kansas City with tiles from\\nthe supply – 2 from the 1 bag under the 1, 2 from the 2 bag\\nunder the 2, and 2 from the 3 bag under the 3.\\n- Shuffle the 36 market cattle cards and place them as a face-\\ndown market cattle stack beneath the lower left of the board.\\nDraw 7 / 10 / 13 cards for 2 / 3 / 4 players. Sort them by color\\nat the bottom of the board.\\n- The orange Simmental cow variant – add all 8 stage 1\\nSimmental cows to the 36 market cattle cards and shuffle.\\nPlace the Simmental market tile on the game board on its\\nspace. Instead of the above, draw 9 / 12 / 15 cards for 2 / 3 /\\n4 players. Sort them by color at the bottom of the board,\\nwith the Simmental cows to the very left. Take the stage 2\\nand stage 3 Simmental cows and place them near the board.\\n- Shuffle the 24 objective cards and place them as a face-down\\nstack to the right of the board. Then reveal 4 cards from the\\nstack and display them face up as the general objective\\ndisplay.\\n- Place the coins and exchange tokens within reach of the\\nplayers as the bank.\\n- Each player chooses a color and gets a player board and a\\nplayer count tile \\\\(with 2-3p. Turn it to the appropriate side\\nand use it to cover Phase A on your player board.\\n- Each player receives 12 private building tiles in their color.\\nEveryone plays with the same side of buildings – so all As or all\\nBs. Once you know the game, you can play with a mix of As\\nand Bs, but everyone still uses the same buildings – if 1B is\\nchosen, then EVERYONE uses 1B.\\n- Each player gets 14 discs \\\\(to cover the colored disc spaces on\\nthe player board\\\\), 1 engine \\\\(placed on the red building near\\nthe track\\\\), 1 certificate marker \\\\(placed on the 0 space of the\\ncertificate track, and 1 herder in their color.\\n- Each player gets 14 player cattle cards in their color \\\\(shown\\non the star\\\\) to make their herd deck.\\n- Shuffle the 4 starting objective cards and deal one at random\\nto each player, which they place face-up in their personal\\nobjective area. Return any remaining starting objectives to the\\nbox.\\n- Determine a start player and give them $6, 4 cards, 1\\nexchange token. Subsequent players get $7, 5 cards, 1\\nexchange token / $8, 6 cards, 1 exchange token / $9, 7 cards, 1\\nexchange token for 2nd / 3rd / 4th player.\\n- Before the first turn of the game, EVERYONE discards down\\nto 4 cards in their starting hand, placing discards in each\\nplayer’s personal discard pile.\\n- Each player then places their herder onto ANY neutral\\nbuilding tile AND CONTINUES TO PHASE B, AS NORMAL.\\nPlayers CAN start at the same building.\\nObject of the Game\\nThe game is played over a number of rounds. Players will\\nmove their herder along the trail to gain victory points \\\\(VP\\\\) by\\nplacing private buildings, buying cattle from the market,\\nupgrading stations, and removing hazards. Each time your\\nherder reaches Kansas City, you send your cattle off to possibly\\ngain VP, then return to the beginning of the trail to start again.\\nALL VP are awarded at the end of the game.\\nYour herd deck is reshuffled ONLY when you need to draw\\nagain. At certain locations, you can discard cattle cards for\\nrewards and when you reach Kansas City, you want as many\\ndifferent types of cattle to get more VP.\\nGAMEPLAY\\nThe game is played with each player playing the following 3\\nphases, before moving to the next clockwise player.\\nA – Move your herder to another location on the trail\\nB – Use the action\\\\(s\\\\) of your reached location\\nC – Draw up to your hand limit\\nPHASE A – MOVE YOUR HERDER TO A LOCATION\\n- A location is ANY tile on a space of the trail. Spaces\\nWITHOUT a tile are NOT locations.\\n- Your herder’s movement is measured in steps. Each location\\nis 1 step.\\n- Your herder MUST move at LEAST 1 step up to their step limit\\n\\\\(3 or 4, depending on player count\\\\), which can be increased\\nlater in the game.\\n- You MUST ALWAYS move your herder FORWARD along the\\ntrail, following the arrows and may choose either path when it\\nforks.\\n- The location where your herder ends their movement is the\\nlocation you will use in Phase B.\\n- You are NOT allowed to pass OVER Kansas City. Once you\\nreach Kansas City, your herder ends its movement there.\\n- Multiple players’ herders can share a location.\\nIMPORTANT – Several locations show a green or black hand\\n\\\\(or BOTH\\\\). If your herder moves to or passes over such a\\nlocation, you MUST pay a fee.\\nIf it’s a hazard/outlaw, the fee is paid to the BANK. If it’s\\nanother player’s private building, the fee is paid to that\\nPLAYER.\\nThe fee depends on player count. In a 2p game, each hand is\\n$2. In a 3p game, green hands cost $2 and black hands cost\\n$1. In a 4p game, green hands cost $1 and black hands cost\\n$2.\\nIMPORTANT – Even if you cannot pay some or all of the\\nhands along your path, you are STILL ALLOWED to move. You\\npay what you can and continue moving. Inability to pay hand\\nfees DOES NOT stop your movement. This ONLY applies to\\nhand fees. ANY OTHER costs/requirements in the game\\nMUST ALWAYS be paid/met in full.\\nPHASE B – USE THE ACTION OF YOUR REACHED LOCATION\\nAfter moving your herder, use the location where you ended\\nyour movement. Your options vary depending on whether it\\nis:\\n• A neutral building or YOUR private building\\n• ANOTHER player’s private building, hazard, or outlaw.\\n• Kansas City\\na. – On a neutral building or YOUR private building, you have\\ntwo options – use the local action\\\\(s\\\\) of the tile OR use ONE\\nsingle auxiliary action.\\nIf you choose to use the tiles local actions, you MAY perform\\nEACH of the tile’s local actions ONCE and MAY perform them\\nin ANY order.\\nYou do NOT have to perform ALL of the available actions, but if\\nthere is a cost/requirement, you MUST pay/meet it in full to\\ngain the reward.\\nActions separated by a white slash are either/or NOT both.\\nSpaces separated by full-length straight lines ARE both/all.\\nSome spaces of the trail have risk actions attached. If a\\nbuilding tile is placed on such a space, the risk action becomes\\npart of that building tile’s local actions and can be performed\\nby its OWNER each time that player reaches that location.\\nIf you do NOT perform ANY of the tile’s local actions, then you\\nMAY perform ONE single auxiliary action instead. Auxiliary\\nactions are on the left of your player board. Initially, you only\\nhave two of them available.\\nb. – On another player’s building tile, hazard, or outlaw tile,\\nyou have ONLY ONE option – performing ONE single auxiliary\\naction.\\nc. – When you reach Kansas City, you MUST carry out ALL 5\\nKansas City subphases IN ORDER. They are:\\n1 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 1 and\\nmove it to its corresponding section.\\n2 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 2 and\\nmove it to its corresponding section.\\n3 – Choose one of the two tiles below the 3 and\\nmove it to its corresponding section.\\n4 – Reveal your ENTIRE hand, calculate your income\\nfrom the bank, then discard your ENTIRE hand to\\nyour discard pile.\\n5 – Move one of your player discs from your player\\nboard onto a city crest and pay ANY transport costs.\\n\\\\(1-2-3\\\\) Each of the 3 tiles in subphases 1, 2, and 3 must\\nIMMEDIATELY be moved to its corresponding section to the\\nlowest available space. If no space is available, take the tile\\nout of the game and return it to the box.\\nIf it is an outlaw tile \\\\(green or orange\\\\), place it in the outlaw\\nsection onto the empty space with the lowest number. If no\\nempty space is left there, take the tile out of the game.\\nIf it is a hazard tile \\\\(flood, drought, or rockfall\\\\), place it in the\\ncorresponding section onto the empty space with the lowest\\nnumber. If no empty space is left there, take the tile out of the\\ngame.\\nIf it is a worker tile, it MUST be placed in the next free space of\\nthe job market – starting with the row with the job market\\ntoken.\\nAs soon as you need to place a worker tile on the job market\\ntoken space, slide the job market token down to the dashed\\nround space of the next row.\\nIf the job market token crosses over a yellow arrow, you\\nIMMEDIATELY fill up the cattle market, bringing the cattle\\nmarket back up to 7 / 10 / 13 cards \\\\(or 9 / 12 / 15 with\\nSimmental variant\\\\) for 2 / 3 / 4 players.\\nIf you need to refill the cattle market and the total cards there\\nare already equal to or higher than the amount, do NOT add\\nany cards.\\nIf the cattle market stack is empty, no more cards are added to\\nthe cattle market.\\nIf the job market token moves over the green arrow at the\\nbottom, the game end is triggered.\\n\\\\(4 – Income\\\\) Reveal your ENTIRE hand and calculate its\\nbreeding value. To do this, add the breeding values of each\\nDIFFERENT TYPE of cattle in your hand. Each type is ONLY\\ncounted ONCE.\\nThen, if possible, you MAY increase the total breeding value by\\nadding certificates \\\\(temporary or permanent\\\\) to it. Temporary\\ncertificates are those on your certificate track and you add\\nthem by moving your marker back. Permanent certificates are\\nthose on the upper half of any station master tiles in front of\\nyou, permanently increasing your breeding value for the rest\\nof the game.\\nOnce your breeding value is set, take that many dollars from\\nthe bank, placing it aside to track your breeding value for\\nsubphase 5. Simmental variant – AFTER setting your breeding\\nvalue, if you have any stage 1 Simmental cattle cards in your\\nhand, you may remove them from the game and take the\\nsame number of stage 2 Simmental cattle cards and place\\nthem on your discard pile. If you have any stage 2 Simmental\\ncattle cards in your hand, you may remove them from the\\ngame and take the same number of stage 3 Simmental cattle\\ncards and place them on your discard pile. THESE DO NOT\\nINCREASE YOUR JUST CALCULATED BREEDING VALUE.\\nWhen calculating your breeding value, you can ONLY add\\nONE of your Simmental cattle cards REGARDLESS of stage.\\nIf an action requires you to discard a cattle card of a certain\\nbreeding value, but the icon DOES NOT include orange cattle\\ncards, you CANNOT discard a Simmental cattle card.\\nThen, discard ALL cards from your hand.\\n\\\\(5 – Delivery\\\\) Pick a city whose city value is equal to or less\\nthan your breeding value. You CANNOT pick a city that you\\nhave already delivered to before, EXCEPT for the local city –\\nKansas City – and the terminal city – New York.\\nOnce you have chosen a city, place one of your player discs\\nfrom your board onto the city space.\\nA disc taken from a WHITE-cornered space on your board can\\nbe placed onto ANY city space. A disc taken from a DARK-\\ncornered space can ONLY be placed onto a DARK-cornered city\\nspace.\\nBy clearing a disc space on your board, you unlock an ability.\\nSome disc spaces give an additional reward or have an added\\ncost for clearing them.\\nBy placing your disc onto a city space, you may gain or lose VP\\nat the end of the game and may trigger delivery actions that\\nyou MUST perform IMMEDIATELY. The action in any of the\\ngreen arrows is NOT triggered until BOTH city spaces have one\\nof your discs. This also goes for VP at game end.\\nEXCEPTION – if you have NO MORE WHITE-CORNERED discs\\non your board and have to place one, you MAY take a DARK-\\nCORNERED ONE!\\nFinally, check if there are any transport costs based on how\\nmany RED Xs are between the nose of your engine and the city\\ncrest to which you are delivering. Pay $1 for each of them and\\nthis payment MAY come from the money you just received for\\ndelivering.\\nAfter finishing the Delivery subphase, move your herder to the\\nhorseman space at the beginning of the trail and refill the\\nempty foresight spaces with the appropriate tiles from the\\nmatching numbered bag.\\nPHASE C – DRAW UP TO YOUR HAND LIMIT\\nEach player starts with a hand limit of 4 and can increase it up\\nto 6. If you have fewer cards in hand than your hand limit,\\ndraw cards from your personal draw pile to equal your hand\\nlimit, shuffling your discards as necessary. Once this phase is\\ncomplete, it is the next player’s turn.\\nHire One Worker\\nWhen you perform this action, choose exactly ONE worker tile\\nfrom the job market, pay the cost and place that tile in the\\nworker section of your player board.\\nYou CANNOT hire a worker from the row where the job\\nmarket token is CURRENTLY located. Those workers are\\nUNAVAILABLE until the job market has moved on.\\nThe hiring cost of any of the workers is the cost on the right\\nside of their row, but it is modified by the value on the action\\nitself. A + in green means a discount. A – in red means an\\nadded cost.\\nAfter paying the cost, place the worker tile in the worker\\nsection of your player board onto the leftmost free space of its\\ntype. Each player starts with one worker of each of the three\\ntypes on their board.\\nIf the space on which you placed the hired worker depicts an\\nimmediate action, you MUST choose to either perform the\\naction IMMEDIATELY OR FORFEIT IT.\\nIf the row is already full, you CANNOT hire another worker of\\nthat type. At the end of the game, every worker placed on the\\n5th or 6th space is worth 4 VP.\\nBuying from the Cattle Market\\nWhen you perform this action, you can acquire new cattle\\ncards from the cattle market and place them face-up on your\\ndiscard pile. However, the number of cards you can buy\\ndepends on how many cowboys you have and how much\\nmoney you want to spend.\\nYou don’t SPEND cowboys, you USE them. The amount of\\ncowboys used will tell you your purchase options at the\\nbottom of the board. EACH cowboy can ONLY be used ONCE\\nduring this action.\\nFor example: If you use just one cowboy, you can either buy\\none 3-value card for $6 OR buy one 4-value card for $12. You\\ncan ONLY buy cattle cards that are available and can ALWAYS\\nchoose to buy fewer cards than allowed.\\nAny cowboy that you do NOT put to use to buy cattle cards\\nMAY instead be used to draw 2 cards from the market cattle\\nstack and be added face-up to the cattle market. You MAY do\\nthis at ANY given moment when performing the action.\\nSimmental variant – you can also use 1 cowboy to buy one\\nstage 1 Simmental for $8 or use 2 cowboys to buy one stage 1\\nSimmental for $5.\\nMovement on the Railroad Track\\nWith this action, you may move your engine up to as many\\nspaces FORWARD on the railroad track as you have engineers\\nin your engineer row.\\nWhenever you move your engine, you SKIP over spaces with\\nother engines as NO two engines can occupy the SAME space.\\nAlong the track, there are several turnout spaces with train\\nstations. Each turnout space COUNTS as an additional space.\\nYou MAY move your engine less spaces than allowed \\\\(but\\nMUST move at LEAST 1\\\\), however once you stop, you forfeit\\nany additional movement.\\nIf you stop on a turnout space, you MUST IMMEDIATELY\\ndecide if you are going to upgrade the station. You can only\\nupgrade a station if you have not upgraded it before \\\\(your disc\\nisn’t already there\\\\).\\nTo upgrade the station, pay the upgrade cost and place one of\\nyour discs on the station space. Again, you must follow the\\nrules for disc placement as for delivery – WHITE can go on any\\none, DARK can only go on DARK.\\nAfter you place your disc, you may take a station master tile\\nthere by taking any hired worker from the rightmost space of\\nyour player board and placing it there.\\nYou can ONLY choose to do this at the moment you are\\nupgrading the station, NOT later.\\nIf you remove a worker from your board uncovering an\\nimmediate action, you CAN perform that action again the next\\ntime you hire a worker onto that space. Once its placed on the\\nstation, it remains there for the rest of the game.\\nEach station master tile has two parts. The top half is an\\nimmediate action \\\\(performed IMMEDIATELY or forfeited\\\\) or\\npermanent certificate. The bottom half is a unique way to\\nscore more VP at game end.\\nThe last space of the railroad track is special. If your engine\\nreaches the last space, its movement ends there \\\\(potentially\\nupgrading the station as usual\\\\). Then you must move your\\nengine BACKWARDS at LEAST one space and you MAY move it\\nto ANY free space on the track, INCLUDING a turnout space.\\nAfter doing so, immediately gain $3. If you moved to a turnout\\nspace, you MAY IMMEDIATELY upgrade it as usual \\\\(even using\\nthe money you JUST received\\\\).\\nIf you ever need to move your engine backwards a certain\\namount of spaces, you MUST move it the full amount, even\\ngoing into a turnout space.\\nObjective Cards\\nWhen you gain an objective card, EITHER choose one from the\\nface-up display OR take one from the top of the deck, placing\\nit in your discard pile. If you take one from the display,\\nIMMEDIATELY fill the vacant space, EVEN if you have\\nunlocked multiple city spaces giving you two of them!\\nDuring your turn, if you happen to have one or more objective\\ncards in your hand, you can play any of them, either before\\nPhase A or before or after performing any one action in Phase\\nB.\\nWhen played, place it face-up in your personal objective area,\\nTHEN perform the immediate action in the card’s upper left\\ncorner or forfeit it.\\nEach objective card depicts a combination of tasks to be\\nfulfilled at the END OF THE GAME. If all are fulfilled, then you\\ngain the VP. If they are NOT fulfilled, then you lose the\\nnegative VP printed on it.\\nIMPORTANT – EACH SINGLE task can ONLY count towards\\nONE objective card – NO double-dipping on objective cards.\\nStation master bonuses are INDEPENDENT from objective\\ncards.\\nYou are NOT required to play your objective cards. If you\\nwant, you can keep some or all of them in your deck without\\ncommitting to them during the game, though they will clog\\nyour deck. At the end of the game, you will have the option to\\npull these objective cards from your deck to score them or not\\nand suffer no penalty.\\nPlace one of your private buildings\\nWhen you perform this action, choose ONE of the private\\nbuildings above your player board. EITHER place it onto ANY\\nempty building space on the trail OR use it to replace one of\\nyour private buildings already placed.\\nYou CANNOT flip the tile from the side chosen at setup.\\nYou MUST have enough builders AND be able to pay the\\nbuilding cost.\\nIn its upper left corner, each building tile shows the minimum\\nnumber of builders that you must have to place the building.\\nFor EACH builder needed, you MUST pay $2.\\nYou can use this action to replace one of your buildings, with a\\nHIGHER valued building. For this, you only need to have the\\nDIFFERENCE of builders between the two buildings and must\\nonly pay the difference as well. Then replace the old building\\nwith the new one, REMOVING the old one from the game.\\nThis is the ONLY way to place buildings that require more than\\n6 workers.\\nIf you replace a building with your herder on it, you do NOT\\nget to immediately use the new building.\\nPerform single/double auxiliary actions\\nWhenever you use a single auxiliary action, you ONLY get its\\nbenefit ONCE, even if both spaces are cleared. You MAY use\\nan auxiliary actions with both spaces cleared as a single.\\nWhenever you use a double auxiliary action, you can ONLY\\nchoose an auxiliary action that has both spaces cleared,\\ngaining double the reward. You CAN use this to only do a\\nsingle auxiliary action.\\nIf you ever need to move your engine backwards on the train\\ntrack, you MUST move the full number of spaces.\\nCollect bounty for outlaws\\nWhen you perform this action, you can remove ONE outlaw\\ntile of your choice from the outlaw section and place it in front\\nof you for potential game end VP. Depending on the money\\nvalue above the outlaw tile, you will either receive or pay\\nmoney to the bank.\\nIf the outlaw section is empty, you CANNOT get a tile. If there\\nis a herder on a removed tile, it stays there.\\nGain an exchange token\\nWhen you perform this action, gain ONE exchange token from\\nthe bank.\\nYou can use one OR MORE of them at ANY point, even when it\\nisn’t your turn. To use an exchange token, place it back in the\\nbank, then draw 2 cards from your personal draw stack and\\nIMMEDIATELY discard as many cards as you drew.\\nRemoving a Hazard\\nWhen you remove a hazard tile, you can remove ONE hazard\\ntile of your choice and place it in front of you for game end VP.\\nIf the icon shows a cost, you MUST IMMEDIATELY pay that\\ncost or you cannot take the tile.\\nIf all three hazard sections are empty, you CANNOT get a tile.\\nIf there is a herder on a removed tile, it stays there.\\nMove your herder forward\\nThis action lets you move your herder to another location\\nalong the trail. If you do, you MUST move at least 1 step and\\nCANNOT move it more steps than indicated.\\nOn the location you stop, you MUST then perform all of phase\\nB again. You DO NOT replenish your hand cards before\\nperforming this phase B again – ONLY at the end of your turn.\\nGAME END\\nThe game end is triggered when a player places a worker tile\\nonto the LAST space of the job market during subphase 2 or 3\\nin Kansas City. When the job market token crosses over the\\ngreen arrow, that player takes the token \\\\(worth 2 VP at game\\nend\\\\). This is that player’s LAST turn. Then, EACH OTHER\\nplayer has ONE final turn.\\nWorker tiles CANNOT be chosen to be placed from the\\nforesight spaces during these last turns by anyone reaching\\nKansas City.\\nAfter the last player has finished their final turn, the game\\nends.\\nFINAL SCORING\\nPlayers score as follows:\\n1 – 1 VP per $5 on hand\\n2 – VP from private buildings on the board\\n3 – VP total from city spaces with their disc\\n4 – VP total from train stations with their disc\\n5 – VP from hazard tiles collected\\n6 – VP from cattle cards in deck, hand, and discard pile\\n7 – VP from objective cards on the table, pulling any still in\\ntheir deck that they want to score\\n8 – VP from individual tasks at the bottoms of any station\\nmaster tiles – again, these items can independently be\\nitems used for objective cards as well\\n9 – 4 VP for each worker placed on the 5th or 6th space of\\nany row in their worker section\\n10 – 3 VP for the appropriate space cleared from their\\nplayer board\\n11 – 2 VP for the job market token\\nMost VP wins the game and there is NO TIE-BREAKER\\n⟨72⟩ https://s.asim.sh/images/ll2kZojooRfvIyu1XAtiv.jpeg: ![An app called AI Got It where AI names certain things, and user should picture it and upload.
