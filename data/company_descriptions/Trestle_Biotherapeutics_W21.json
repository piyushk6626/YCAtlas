This has the potential to not only get these patients off dialysis - a significant impact for them and their families - but to greatly extend the time required before kidney transplantation is essential.",

There are only two treatment options for people who progress to kidney failure – a rare kidney transplant or dialysis. While dialysis is a life-saving and essential treatment for more than 550,000 Americans, there have been no advances of treatment options for those with kidney failure since its advent nearly 60 years ago. And while dialysis sustains life, patients must endure constant medical risks of infection, vascular collapse, and personal tolls on quality of life.\\nTrestle is developing an implantable therapeutic tissue that will be delivered to patients suffering from end stage renal disease (ESRD). Our implantable bioengineered tissues will get patients off dialysis, delay their need for transplantation, and one day become replacement organs.\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n![](https://trestlebio.com/wp-content/uploads/Kidney_Illustration.png)\\n1\\n**550,000** Kidney Failure patients in the US depend on dialysis for survival\\n2\\n5-year survival for patients on long-term dialysis is **under 40%**\\n3\\nOf the **785,000** ESRD patients in the US, only **22,000** will receive a kidney transplant next year\\n4\\nCOVID survivors are **3X** as likely to be diagnosed with ESRD\\n5\\n**130,000** patients are diagnosed with ESRD in the US each year (356 patients every day)\\n## Team\\n[![](https://trestlebio.com/wp-content/uploads/Ben-Shepherd-updated-300x300.png)](http://www.trestlebio.com/<https:/trestlebio.com/team/ben-shepherd-phd/> \"Ben-Shepherd-updated\")\\n## [Ben Shepherd, PhD](http://www.trestlebio.com/<https:/trestlebio.com/team/ben-shepherd-phd/> \"Permanent Link: Ben Shepherd, PhD\")\\nDecember 20, 2021/in [Leadership](http://www.trestlebio.com/<https:/trestlebio.com/team/leadership/>)/by [David Anderson](http://www.trestlebio.com/<https:/trestlebio.com> \"Posts by David Anderson\")\\nCo-Founder and Chief Executive Officer\\nBen is a vascular biologist, tissue engineer and regenerative medicine scientist by training.

There are only two treatment options for people who progress to kidney failure – a rare kidney transplant or dialysis. While dialysis is a life-saving and essential treatment for more than 550,000 Americans, there have been no advances of treatment options for those with kidney failure since its advent nearly 60 years ago. And while dialysis sustains life, patients must endure constant medical risks of infection, vascular collapse, and personal tolls on quality of life.\\nTrestle is developing an implantable therapeutic tissue that will be delivered to patients suffering from end stage renal disease (ESRD). Our implantable bioengineered tissues will get patients off dialysis, delay their need for transplantation, and one day become replacement organs.\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n![](https://trestlebio.com/wp-content/uploads/Kidney_Illustration.png)\\n1\\n**550,000** Kidney Failure patients in the US depend on dialysis for survival\\n2\\n5-year survival for patients on long-term dialysis is **under 40%**\\n3\\nOf the **785,000** ESRD patients in the US, only **22,000** will receive a kidney transplant next year\\n4\\nCOVID survivors are **3X** as likely to be diagnosed with ESRD\\n5\\n**130,000** patients are diagnosed with ESRD in the US each year (356 patients every day)\\n## Team\\n![⟨7⟩](http://www.trestlebio.com/<https:/trestlebio.com/team/ben-shepherd-phd/> \"Ben-Shepherd-updated\")\\n## Ben Shepherd, PhD⟨8⟩\\nDecember 20, 2021/in Leadership⟨9⟩/by David Anderson⟨10⟩\\nCo-Founder and Chief Executive Officer\\nBen is a vascular biologist, tissue engineer and regenerative medicine scientist by training.

  "generated_description": "### Trestle Biotherapeutics: Pioneering Bioengineered Solutions for Kidney Health\n\nFounded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's Winter 2021 batch, Trestle Biotherapeutics is on a mission to transform the lives of patients suffering from kidney failure. Based in San Diego, CA, this biotech startup is small but mighty, with a lean team of just two employees. This focused team is driven by a powerful vision: to develop bioengineered kidneys that could alleviate the burdens of dialysis and extend the time patients can avoid transplantation.\n\n#### The Problem They're Tackling\n\nKidney disease is a pressing global health issue, impacting around 850 million people worldwide, including 37 million in the United States. For those who progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), treatment options are limited to kidney transplants or dialysis—both of which come with significant limitations and risks. Dialysis, while lifesaving, can be a grueling process and doesn't advance treatment options despite its long history.\n\n#### Trestle's Innovative Approach\n\nTrestle is developing a novel implantable therapeutic tissue that aims to supplement kidney function upon surgical delivery. This innovative solution could not only help patients transition off dialysis but also buy them time before the need for a kidney transplant arises. Essentially, they're working towards creating a bioengineered organ that could one day serve as a replacement for traditional kidney transplants.\n\n\"We see our work as not just a solution for a problem but a catalyst to bridge various scientific disciplines, leading to breakthroughs not just for kidney disease, but potentially for other organ failures too,\" says co-founders Ben Shepherd, PhD, and Alice Chen, PhD.\n\n### The Team Behind Trestle\n\n- **Ben Shepherd, PhD**: Co-Founder and CEO. With over a decade of experience in tissue engineering and vascular biology, Ben previously held leadership roles in research and development at Organovo, focusing on complex 3D human tissue systems.\n  \n- **Alice Chen, PhD**: Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer. Renowned for her expertise in stem cell biology and bioprinting, Alice has a rich history in early-stage biotech, previously directing R&D pipeline development at Organovo.\n\nTheir combined experience and knowledge in biofabrication, fluidics, and stem cell biology equip Trestle with the necessary tools to tackle this complex challenge.\n\n### Milestones and Recognition\n\nTrestle has garnered significant traction in the biotech community, recently winning a $1 million prize from the KidneyX Innovation Accelerator through the Artificial Kidney Prize program. This recognition is a testament to their innovative approach and the potential of their technology to address urgent healthcare needs.\n\nThey have also joined the Wellcome Leap HOPE program, aligning with other forward-thinking organizations to accelerate their research and development efforts.\n\n### Why \"Trestle\"?\n\nThe name \"Trestle\" symbolizes a bridge—connecting patients to better health solutions and bridging various scientific disciplines. It's about fostering collaboration across the globe to create solutions that can change lives. The company embodies an ambitious and multifaceted approach to bioengineering, blending academic rigor with entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n### Future Aspirations\n\nTrestle Biotherapeutics aims to disrupt the treatment landscape for kidney failure, and if they succeed, the impact could ripple through multiple fields, providing a new paradigm in organ replacement therapies. By harnessing cutting-edge technologies and a collaborative spirit, Trestle hopes to turn its vision into reality and ultimately serve millions of patients in need. \n\nFor more information, visit [Trestle Biotherapeutics](http://www.trestlebio.com)."
