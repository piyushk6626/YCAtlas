  "description": "Breathe Well-being helps people prevent or manage chronic lifestyle diseases by losing weight through its digital therapeutics program (weight-loss clinic in a cloud, think Noom for India). The program is delivered remotely over the phone and through the mobile app, therefore users are able to follow the lifestyle program from the convenience of their home. Our online program is 3X more effective at 1/4th the cost.\r\n\nThe user receives bi-weekly 1-1 coaching focused on behavioral changes, online community for support and motivation, and a mobile app that provides educational lessons, lifestyle tracking tools and weekly challenges (gamification). The content and behavioral change techniques are centred around healthy diet, fitness, lifestyle and stress reduction.\r\n\nOur unique coaching methodology employs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), goal-oriented treatment and self-efficacy enhancement. The coach helps the user bust negative emotions of past failures in weight-loss and increase motivation by linking short-term achievable goals with the user's personal values. Through the program, the user is able to self-identify triggers of unhealthy habit adoption and make better decisions.\r\n\nBreathe Well-being has demonstrated success in helping people lose weight, build long-term healthy habits and reduce/eliminate medication for lifestyle diseases (example - Type 2 Diabetes). We are looking for ideas to improve our sales processes so that we can get users to enrol at a higher conversion rate post our 1-week free trial. We need to identify triggers when users are most likely to pay and provide them with a seamless process for paying on-the-spot.",

This plan includes a healthy diet, physical activities, medications, regular sugar level checks, insulin intake, and usage of devices. \\nThis collective practice helps to keep a daily tab on your sugar level status. \\nThis entire plan consists of HOW, WHAT, and WHEN like how regularly do you check your blood sugar? What medicines are you taking? When do you need to take a doctor’s advice etc? \\nThis plan keeps you handy with all the required questions and their solutions to avoid any emergency. \\nFurthermore, for better diabetes management, it is important to follow a long-term diabetes management plan of 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. \\nSuch long-term plans may include HbA1C tests, weight management, running some tests like cholesterols, eyes, and dental check-ups. Also, consult a doctor for your holistic diabetes management check-up in detail. \\nTo manage pre-diabetes, type 1 & 2 diabetes, it is important to be vigilant about every health aspect. It will help you to control your blood sugars and also help you to avoid other health-related complications. \\n##  What are the five components of diabetes management? \\nDiabetes management program helps pre-diabetic and type-2 diabetic people reverse their diabetes whereas type-1 diabetic people can easily manage their sugar levels. A perfect diabetes management plan consists of 5M’s. These components help in the significant reduction of blood sugar levels and HbA1C. \\nThese 5M components of diabetes management are: \\n  * Monitoring\\n  * Medication\\n  * Meal\\n  * Movement\\n  * Medical Support\\n\\n\\n### Monitoring:\\nIt is very essential to monitor your daily sugar levels to identify the factors that raise your sugar levels. It also provides you with the progress you made. Constant monitoring aids to modify the diet and exercise regime and also supports doctors at the time of consultation. So always monitor your Fasting and PP sugar levels. \\n### Medication:\\nIt is important not to overlook your medication and take them on time. Do not increase, decrease or stop your dosage without a physician’s consultation. These medications have different roles from reducing insulin resistance to increasing insulin secretion from the pancreas, allowing the body to make use \\nThese medications are bifurcate in Insulin Therapy and Oral Medication. So you do not know which medicine is working for you for which particular role. Type 2 diabetics need to take care of their medications to improve insulin resistance and follow a diabetes management plan. Type 2 diabetes treatment helps to normalize the blood sugar levels in the body. \\n### Meal:\\nFood plays a pivotal role in keeping your blood sugar levels in control. So always pay extra attention to what you’re eating. High carb and high-calorie food will impact your sugar levels and spike them. Your diet should be a perfect diabetic diet according to the diabetes management program. A diabetic diet helps type-2 diabetic people who are looking for diabetes reversal. \\n### Movement:\\nLiving a sedentary lifestyle is a big reason to develop type 2 diabetes. It also increases your blood sugar levels. We need the energy to work out, walk and perform daily tasks and we get this energy from glucose. The body uses this glucose or sugar to keep us active. If you don’t move much and do not exercise, this sugar accumulates in the bloodstream and spikes the sugar levels. In a diabetes management plan, it is always advised to follow an exercise regime to use up this accumulated sugar as energy. A health plan for diabetes reversal has many sets of workouts for diabetes reversal for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. So start moving and reduce your high blood sugar levels. \\n### Medical Support:\\nEven if you are not seeing any complications or fluctuating blood sugars, it is still important to seek a doctor’s consultation every 3 or 6 months. It is a precautionary measure to avoid any upcoming complexities. Diabetes is a set of diseases that impacts various organs and it becomes important to stay extra vigilant about your health. \\nTake some tests yearly like an eye test, HbA1C, cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney function, foot test, etc. to keep a tab on your health. \\nApart from these 5M’s, there is another M that can be important for Diabetes Management. This M is a Mobile App. There are numerous mobile apps available to keep a log of your calorie intake, workout routine, burned calories, blood sugar levels, HbA1C, step counts, etc. \\nThese mobile apps are a handy version of your human assistance. It is like having a digital personal coach that reminds you about your lifestyle management and keeps you ready on your toes. There are many diabetes apps available on the play store and apple store like the prediabetes management app and type 2 diabetes management app. Breathe Well-being is one of the effective and result-oriented mobile apps which is helping thousands of prediabetics and type 2 diabetics manage their sugar levels. \\n##  What is the management of prediabetes \\nManagement of prediabetes includes lifestyle modifications and in some cases prescribed medications. Prediabetes is a condition where the risk factor of developing type 2 diabetes is higher. This is an alarming stage where you can put a stop to a prediabetes management plan. \\nManagement of prediabetes focuses on preventing or delaying beta cell failure. It also helps improve insulin sensitivity. \\n...\\nMultiple risk factors trigger the development of prediabetes in people. These factors are age, obesity, genetics, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, ethnicity, lack of physical activities, and alcohol. \\nManagement of prediabetes is the technique or therapy to avoid the possibility of type 2 diabetes development from diabetes. \\nThe first level of prediabetes treatment includes Lifestyle Modifications. Dietary changes, exercises, and weight loss are the three major contributors to preventing or delaying beta-cell failure resulting in type 2 diabetes. This process can be known as the first- line defense against T2DM. These lifestyle measures help reduce blood sugar levels. \\nIf lifestyle modifications don’t help reduce blood sugar levels, then the doctor suggests antidiabetic drugs. These drugs reduce blood sugar levels and the risk of T2DM. Thus, lifestyle modifications and medications aid in prediabetes treatment. \\n##  What are the principles of diabetes management? \\nDiabetes is like an epidemic in today’s world. Over 77 million Indian people are diabetic. This number is increasing every year and is expected to shoot up to 134 million by the year 2045. It is important to reduce these spiking numbers by promoting a few principles of diabetes management. \\nAccording to the National Diabetes Education Program (US), diabetes management programs have 10 principles to reverse diabetes. These 10 principles help in the management of diabetes and promote overall well-being. \\nPrinciples of Diabetes Management are: \\n  * Principle 1: Identify People With Undiagnosed Diabetes and Prediabetes\\n  * Principle 2: Manage Prediabetes to Prevent or Delay the Onset of Type 2 Diabetes\\n  * Principle 3: Provide Comprehensive, Patient-centered Diabetes Care\\n  * Principle 4: Provide Ongoing Self-management Education and Support for People with Diabetes\\n  * Principle 5: Encourage Lifestyle Modification for People with Diabetes\\n  * Principle 6: Address Overweight and Obesity in the Management of Diabetes\\n  * Principle 7: Individualize Blood Glucose Management for People with Diabetes\\n  * Principle 8: Provide Multifactorial Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction\\n  * Principle 9: Detect and Monitor Diabetes Microvascular Complications and Provide Treatment to Slow Their Progression\\n  * Principle 10: Consider the Needs of Special Populations with Diabetes\\n\\n\\n##  What are the principles of diabetes management? \\nDiabetes is like an epidemic in today’s world.

This plan includes a healthy diet, physical activities, medications, regular sugar level checks, insulin intake, and usage of devices. \\nThis collective practice helps to keep a daily tab on your sugar level status. \\nThis entire plan consists of HOW, WHAT, and WHEN like how regularly do you check your blood sugar? What medicines are you taking? When do you need to take a doctor’s advice etc? \\nThis plan keeps you handy with all the required questions and their solutions to avoid any emergency. \\nFurthermore, for better diabetes management, it is important to follow a long-term diabetes management plan of 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. \\nSuch long-term plans may include HbA1C tests, weight management, running some tests like cholesterols, eyes, and dental check-ups. Also, consult a doctor for your holistic diabetes management check-up in detail. \\nTo manage pre-diabetes, type 1 & 2 diabetes, it is important to be vigilant about every health aspect. It will help you to control your blood sugars and also help you to avoid other health-related complications. \\n##  What are the five components of diabetes management? \\nDiabetes management program helps pre-diabetic and type-2 diabetic people reverse their diabetes whereas type-1 diabetic people can easily manage their sugar levels. A perfect diabetes management plan consists of 5M’s. These components help in the significant reduction of blood sugar levels and HbA1C. \\nThese 5M components of diabetes management are: \\n  * Monitoring\\n  * Medication\\n  * Meal\\n  * Movement\\n  * Medical Support\\n\\n\\n### Monitoring:\\nIt is very essential to monitor your daily sugar levels to identify the factors that raise your sugar levels. It also provides you with the progress you made. Constant monitoring aids to modify the diet and exercise regime and also supports doctors at the time of consultation. So always monitor your Fasting and PP sugar levels. \\n### Medication:\\nIt is important not to overlook your medication and take them on time. Do not increase, decrease or stop your dosage without a physician’s consultation. These medications have different roles from reducing insulin resistance to increasing insulin secretion from the pancreas, allowing the body to make use \\nThese medications are bifurcate in Insulin Therapy and Oral Medication. So you do not know which medicine is working for you for which particular role. Type 2 diabetics need to take care of their medications to improve insulin resistance and follow a diabetes management plan. Type 2 diabetes treatment helps to normalize the blood sugar levels in the body. \\n### Meal:\\nFood plays a pivotal role in keeping your blood sugar levels in control. So always pay extra attention to what you’re eating. High carb and high-calorie food will impact your sugar levels and spike them. Your diet should be a perfect diabetic diet according to the diabetes management program. A diabetic diet helps type-2 diabetic people who are looking for diabetes reversal. \\n### Movement:\\nLiving a sedentary lifestyle is a big reason to develop type 2 diabetes. It also increases your blood sugar levels. We need the energy to work out, walk and perform daily tasks and we get this energy from glucose. The body uses this glucose or sugar to keep us active. If you don’t move much and do not exercise, this sugar accumulates in the bloodstream and spikes the sugar levels. In a diabetes management plan, it is always advised to follow an exercise regime to use up this accumulated sugar as energy. A health plan for diabetes reversal has many sets of workouts for diabetes reversal for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. So start moving and reduce your high blood sugar levels. \\n### Medical Support:\\nEven if you are not seeing any complications or fluctuating blood sugars, it is still important to seek a doctor’s consultation every 3 or 6 months. It is a precautionary measure to avoid any upcoming complexities. Diabetes is a set of diseases that impacts various organs and it becomes important to stay extra vigilant about your health. \\nTake some tests yearly like an eye test, HbA1C, cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney function, foot test, etc. to keep a tab on your health. \\nApart from these 5M’s, there is another M that can be important for Diabetes Management. This M is a Mobile App. There are numerous mobile apps available to keep a log of your calorie intake, workout routine, burned calories, blood sugar levels, HbA1C, step counts, etc. \\nThese mobile apps are a handy version of your human assistance. It is like having a digital personal coach that reminds you about your lifestyle management and keeps you ready on your toes. There are many diabetes apps available on the play store and apple store like the prediabetes management app and type 2 diabetes management app. Breathe Well-being is one of the effective and result-oriented mobile apps which is helping thousands of prediabetics and type 2 diabetics manage their sugar levels. \\n##  What is the management of prediabetes \\nManagement of prediabetes includes lifestyle modifications and in some cases prescribed medications. Prediabetes is a condition where the risk factor of developing type 2 diabetes is higher. This is an alarming stage where you can put a stop to a prediabetes management plan. \\nManagement of prediabetes focuses on preventing or delaying beta cell failure. It also helps improve insulin sensitivity. \\n...\\nMultiple risk factors trigger the development of prediabetes in people. These factors are age, obesity, genetics, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, ethnicity, lack of physical activities, and alcohol. \\nManagement of prediabetes is the technique or therapy to avoid the possibility of type 2 diabetes development from diabetes. \\nThe first level of prediabetes treatment includes Lifestyle Modifications. Dietary changes, exercises, and weight loss are the three major contributors to preventing or delaying beta-cell failure resulting in type 2 diabetes. This process can be known as the first- line defense against T2DM. These lifestyle measures help reduce blood sugar levels. \\nIf lifestyle modifications don’t help reduce blood sugar levels, then the doctor suggests antidiabetic drugs. These drugs reduce blood sugar levels and the risk of T2DM. Thus, lifestyle modifications and medications aid in prediabetes treatment. \\n##  What are the principles of diabetes management? \\nDiabetes is like an epidemic in today’s world. Over 77 million Indian people are diabetic. This number is increasing every year and is expected to shoot up to 134 million by the year 2045. It is important to reduce these spiking numbers by promoting a few principles of diabetes management. \\nAccording to the National Diabetes Education Program (US), diabetes management programs have 10 principles to reverse diabetes. These 10 principles help in the management of diabetes and promote overall well-being. \\nPrinciples of Diabetes Management are: \\n  * Principle 1: Identify People With Undiagnosed Diabetes and Prediabetes\\n  * Principle 2: Manage Prediabetes to Prevent or Delay the Onset of Type 2 Diabetes\\n  * Principle 3: Provide Comprehensive, Patient-centered Diabetes Care\\n  * Principle 4: Provide Ongoing Self-management Education and Support for People with Diabetes\\n  * Principle 5: Encourage Lifestyle Modification for People with Diabetes\\n  * Principle 6: Address Overweight and Obesity in the Management of Diabetes\\n  * Principle 7: Individualize Blood Glucose Management for People with Diabetes\\n  * Principle 8: Provide Multifactorial Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction\\n  * Principle 9: Detect and Monitor Diabetes Microvascular Complications and Provide Treatment to Slow Their Progression\\n  * Principle 10: Consider the Needs of Special Populations with Diabetes\\n\\n\\n##  What are the principles of diabetes management? \\nDiabetes is like an epidemic in today’s world.

  "generated_description": "**Breathe Well-being Summary**\n\nBreathe Well-being is an innovative digital health startup based in New Delhi, India, focused on helping people prevent and manage chronic lifestyle diseases, particularly through weight loss and diabetes reversal. Founded as part of Y Combinator's Winter 2020 batch, the company operates like a weight-loss clinic in the cloud—imagine Noom, but tailored to the Indian market.\n\n### Mission\nThe core mission of Breathe Well-being is straightforward: to provide a comprehensive digital well-being program that empowers individuals to take control of their health, primarily by focusing on behaviors that lead to sustainable weight loss and management of chronic conditions like Type 2 Diabetes.\n\n### Program Overview\nBreathe Well-being's program is delivered remotely via a mobile app and phone-based coaching, making it super accessible. Users can partake in bi-weekly one-on-one coaching sessions focusing on behavioral changes, supplemented by a supportive online community and a variety of tracking tools and educational resources. The gamification aspect—like weekly challenges—keeps users motivated and engaged.\n\nBy utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), Breathe Well-being's coaching methodology encourages users to dismantle negative thought patterns associated with past health failures, linking achievable short-term goals to their personal values. The result? Users learn to identify their own triggers for unhealthy habits and make better lifestyle choices.\n\n### Effectiveness\nTheir approach has proven effective: users have reported significant weight loss and reduced or eliminated reliance on medications for chronic conditions. For instance, statistics indicate that 84% of participants have reduced their dependency on medication, and 90% of participants experience a decrease in HbA1c levels, a key marker in diabetes management.\n\n### Business Needs\nCurrently, Breathe Well-being is grappling with improving their sales processes—specifically, they want to increase the conversion rates of users who complete their one-week free trial. They aim to identify triggers that prompt users to enroll and streamline the payment process to make it as seamless as possible.\n\n### Team and Expertise\nBreathe Well-being operates with a small, dedicated team of 15, leveraging the expertise of over 100 health coaches, dietitians, and diabetologists. Their professional backgrounds are diverse, with each team member bringing significant experience in areas like endocrinology, nutrition, and fitness to support users on their health journeys.\n\n### Summary\nBreathe Well-being is on a mission—specifically, they aspire to reverse diabetes in one million Indians by 2025. They blend technology with human compassion to offer users not just a program, but a transformational journey towards better health. Check out their offerings at their website: [Breathe Well-being](http://www.breathewellbeing.in)."
