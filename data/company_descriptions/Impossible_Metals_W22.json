  "description": "Impossible mining is building underwater robotics vehicles which collect battery metals from the seabed without harming the environment. We have $500M+ in off-take LoI’s and have signed a partnership with a global offshore logistics company which holds a seabed mining exploration permit. We have also built the 1st PoC underwater robotic arm.\r\n\nPolymetallic nodules are rocks which are rich in critical battery metals. Specially nickel, cobalt, manganese and copper. These metals are the the most expensive part of EVs.",

  "generated_description": "**Impossible Metals: Surfacing Innovation in Underwater Mining**\n\nFounded in 2020 and originally known as Impossible Mining, Impossible Metals is on a mission to revolutionize the extraction of critical battery metals from the seabed while keeping environmental stewardship at the forefront. Their focus? Developing cutting-edge underwater robotic vehicles that can efficiently collect polymetallic nodules — rock formations rich in valuable metals like nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper, which are crucial for manufacturing electric vehicle (EV) batteries.\n\nThe team, based in Pasadena, California, is currently 20 strong and supported by Gustaf Alstromer, a partner at Y Combinator, where Impossible Metals emerged as part of Batch W22. They've made impressive strides, securing over $500 million in off-take Letters of Intent and partnering with a major global offshore logistics company that possesses a seabed mining exploration permit. In their pursuit of innovation, they've already developed and successfully tested their first Proof of Concept underwater robotic arm.\n\nWhat makes Impossible Metals stand out is not just its technology, but its commitment to sustainability and responsible mining practices. They aim to harvest these rare materials without damaging marine ecosystems, addressing one of the most pressing concerns surrounding deep-sea mining. With the EV market booming and the demand for such critical metals increasing, their ethical approach seeks to navigate this complex landscape responsibly.\n\nImpossible Metals engages with the broader community, educating the public through webinars and blogs about deep-sea mining, environmental impacts, and regulatory frameworks. The company is also aligned with numerous UN Sustainable Development Goals, making clear its intent to contribute positively to global challenges like climate action (SDG #13) and responsible consumption and production (SDG #12).\n\nSo, if you’re keen on exploring the future of sustainable mining and the breakthroughs in robotic technology poised to reshape our approach to resource extraction, keep an eye on Impossible Metals. With their blend of innovation, environmental consideration, and strategic partnerships, they're attempting something that seemed impossible—extracting riches from the depths of the ocean without leaving a mark. \n\nFor more information, check out their website: [Impossible Metals](https://impossiblemetals.com)."
