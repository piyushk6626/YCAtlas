  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Pyxai**\n\nFounded in 2019 and proudly part of Y Combinator's Batch W19, Pyxai is a Boston-based startup with a mission that packs a punch: to enhance the hiring process by assessing soft skills, which are often the best indicators of long-term job success. With its team of just five, Pyxai has set its sights on a compelling problem—the mismatch in hiring that leads to costly employee turnover, estimated at around $1 trillion annually. \n\nAt its core, Pyxai offers an AI-driven assessment tool that significantly boosts employee retention (by at least 30%) and slashes the time to hire by more than 50%. By focusing on soft skills through job simulations and video assessments, Pyxai makes hiring decisions smarter and reduces bias. This means organizations can not only hire faster but also hire better.\n\n**Key Offerings and Impact**\n- **For Employers:** Pyxai equips organizations with tools to evaluate, identify, and source top talent efficiently.\n- **For Job Seekers:** It helps candidates showcase the soft skills that are crucial for success, even if they aren’t visible on a resume.\n- **Impressive Metrics:** Companies using Pyxai have seen at least 30% more high-performing hires and a 20% reduction in recruiting costs.\n\n**Unique Selling Proposition**\nPyxai stands out by tackling the recruitment challenges head-on: it not only assesses for hard skills but prioritizes soft skills—those intangible qualities that can be pivotal for employee success but often go unnoticed. This dual focus changes the hiring narrative, aiming for better fits and longevity in roles.\n\nWith a growing footprint in the SaaS and B2B sectors, and endorsed by groups like their partner Nan, Pyxai is poised to reshape how organizations think about talent acquisition and employee retention. Their website serves as a hub of information for both employers and job seekers, making the process of finding and securing talent smoother and more effective.\n\nIn a nutshell, Pyxai is all about measuring human potential and creating a more equitable path to employment. If you're looking to modernize your recruitment strategies, this might just be the tool you need. Check them out at [pyxai.com](https://www.pyxai.com)."
