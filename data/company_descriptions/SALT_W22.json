After getting the bank account frozen randomly after international transactions and paying exorbitant high fees for the same, she decide to get into the roots of the problem and solve it. Graduated from IIT Kharagpur, Ankit has also been featured in Forbes 30 under 30 in January 2017. While on a trip to Singapore, Ankit’s card stopped working and his bank’s relationship manager and branch manager said the issue would take several days to resolve. This bitter experience made him realise that being a premium customer for banks did not guarantee better experience or better resolution of issues. Both the founders have been on the other side of the table, and realised it’s not the best place to be when it comes to international business payments. These experiences led to formation of India’s first cross border fintech SALT.\\n### Who can use the Salt product?\\nSALT is building products for SMEs, startups, service providers, freelancers, agencies, and consultants to thrive in the international market by taking care of their international transactions and the legal compliances that comes with it.\\n### Where is Salt based out of?\\nSALT is a fintech startup based out of Bengaluru, Karnataka in India.\\n### We do cross-border banking and compliances for Indian businesses and Foreign Investors.\\n### Regd.
