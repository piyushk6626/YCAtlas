This innovation has enabled them to tap into a massive opportunity, claiming a market potential exceeding $50 billion. Currently, over 5 million consumers interact with SureBright's warranty offerings each month.\n\nThe team leading this charge has a strong pedigree. Sanket, who spearheaded engineering at PolicyBazar—a major insurance tech company valued at over $8 billion—brings a wealth of experience. Meanwhile, Manish has an impressive background from Amazon, where he developed products generating $100 million in annual revenue and processed over 180 billion requests daily.\n\nSureBright's platform is designed to be merchant-friendly, requiring no coding to integrate and promising a seamless upsell for customers. Retailers can see an increase in their Average Order Value by as much as 14% alongside shared revenue on each warranty policy sold. With customization options available, the service can be tailored to match each merchant's branding seamlessly, helping businesses build customer loyalty and trust.\n\nWhat’s more, SureBright covers a broad array of product categories. From cell phones to wellness equipment, its warranty options cater to diverse markets.
