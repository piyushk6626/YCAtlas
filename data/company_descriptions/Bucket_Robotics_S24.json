Bucket Robotics is making defect detection faster and easier to deploy to prevent that.\r\n\nOur products are designed to be easy to integrate into existing automation and technology stacks, flexible enough to bring retooling costs down, and reliable enough to make you forget that it's a robot.\r\n\nMatt and Steph are leveraging their experience from the self-driving industry, where we've integrated high-performance computing and quality sensing into complex, noise-filled environments. We focus on robust hardware and user-friendly software for a new generation of end-users, ensuring ease of use and rapid deployment.\r\n\nSecure and efficient handling of user data can make customers in the manufacturing space nervous to invest in sensing ‚Äî our team's extensive experience handling self-driving car data in these regulated environments positions us uniquely to tackle these challenges. Companies like Keyence, National Instruments, and FLIR offer either outdated hardware or prohibitively expensive systems, along with software that hasn‚Äôt evolved to meet modern user needs.\r\n\nUS manufacturing is undergoing a significant transformation, with construction spending hitting a record annualized pace of over $200 billion. The need for a more reliable supply chain has seen over $700 billion in manufacturing megaprojects across North America since 2021, and this growth requires heavy automation. Bucket Robotics is at the forefront of this shift, offering a scalable, cost-effective solution that enhances automation and positions manufacturers closer to their end customers.",
