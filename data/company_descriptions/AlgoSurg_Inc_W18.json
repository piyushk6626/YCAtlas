Aiming at making 3D printing surgical solutions more automatic and efficient, this software and its APIs can be integrated to existing 3D printing services and their software infrastructure, preferably through cloud.   \\n---  \\n### CTto3D: AI-based Faster CT Segmentation within a minute (demo for Knee and Hip joint)\\nThis AI technology comes as an API which can be integrated with any existing 3D planning software to make the segmentation and 3D reconstruction from CT, much faster (within 1 min) and accurate. We also develop AI-models for customized anatomies and CT data.   \\n### AI-based 3D planning for Heart Structural procedures (TAVR)\\nThis software uses AI technologies to visualize and analyze 3D structures of cardiovascular systems to facilitate accurate pre-operative planning of aortic valve, mitral valve, coronary procedures etc. The software to be integrated with surgical robotics platform performing a catheter-based approach.   \\n### OrthoOncoAI - AI-based 3D planning and navigation for Bone-Tumor surgery planning\\nMerging MRI with CT using AI can provide amazing advantages for 3D planning of a Tumor-Bone surgeries. This software uses AI-tools to register CT with MRI so that a surgeon can visualize bone and tumor in 3D together and plan optimal bone cuts. The software also automatically designs cutting-jigs to make accurate bone resections.   \\n### Surgery Robotics: Integrating AI technolgies with Surgical Robot\\nIn this project, AlgoSurg is integrating its range of AI Technologies with a Surgical-Robotic platform, for various kinds of orthopedic surgeries like Knee-Replacement, Hip-Replacement etc. This technology has been licensed non-exclusively to International MedTech company [Meril](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.merillife.com/>).   \\n### Tabplan3D: Cloud-based 3D surgery simulation\\n[ Tabplan3D ](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/tabplan3d.com/#/>) is the worlds first web-software where surgeon can plan an orthopedic surgeries like complex deformity corrections, HTOs, DFOs, TKR and THR, in 3D view. The 3D bone model is created by AI technologies using either X-ray or CT and the current focus is on Knee and Hip anatomies.   \\n### X3DPSI: Xray-based auto Patient-Specific-Instrument\\n[ X3DPSI ](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/youtu.be/kS-e9Gho9Ds>) is XrayTo3D and CTto3D based automatic Patient Specific Instrumentation (PSI) design technology. The PSIs are 3D printed and used for accurate implant positiong HTO, DFO, TKR or THR surgeries. X3DPSI is a very efficient and cost effective because of its automation, time-saving and option to use plain X-rays as input. This technology is integrated with the Tabplan3D\\'s 3D surgery planning of TKR and Deformity corrections (HTO/DFO).  \\n### OpenSurgiSim: Cloud-based AR enabled surgery training\\n[ OpenSurgiSim ](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.appropedia.org/User:OpenSurgiSim>) was funded by Intuitive Foundation (foundation of Intuitive Surgicals), to build surgery training module for orthopedic surgeons of low and middle income countreies. It uses cloud-based technologies, 3D simulation and Augmented-reality. The goal is to improve and standardise surgical performance and patient outcome for every surgeon in the world.  \\n### Deftfix: Cloud-based surgery planner for Hexapod Fixator\\n[ DeftFix ](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.pitkar.com/deftfix.html>) is a AI-based US-FDA approved cloud-software where surgeon can create accurate schedule for Hexapod fixator implant, anywhere and anytime in minutes. Compared to other stand-alone software, DEFTFIX gives great flexibility to surgeons in terms of choice of computing device, time to create schedule, saving and re-accessing of patient cases easily and efficiently. Currently marketted by India\\'s first orthopedic manufacturer [SHPOPL](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.pitkar.com/>)  \\n### Cloud-based surgery planner for Trauma surgeries\\nA cloud-software for surgeons to plan trauma surgeries with bone plate or internal-nail fixation within 2 minutes. The software helps surgeon to pre-operatively select only required implant of required sizes (as planned in the software) which makes surgeries faster, seamless and safe. For implant manufacturers, this will reduce the cost of sterilisation and transport as they will not need to send all the implant sizes to the operation theatre (which is currently done).  \\n### XrayTo3D: 2D X-ray to 3D bone\\nXrayTo3D is an AI technology which generates 3D models of bones using just two 2D plain X-ray images. Compared to CT based 3D, XrayTo3D is cost-effective, faster and uses easily available resource (plain X-ray). We have developed and proven this AI technology for lower-limb bones and can be used for Robotics and AR-guided surgeries of the future.  \\n### AI-based 3D planning for Maxillofacial Surgeries\\nThis software uses AI technologies for auto-segmentation and 3D generation of maxillofacial structures.

We have developed and proven this AI technology for lower-limb bones and can be used for Robotics and AR-guided surgeries of the future.  \\n## Who we are\\nThe Founders  \\n---  \\n![Dr Vikas Karade is the CEO and Founder of AlgoSurgâ¨11â© Dr. Vikas Karade - CEO  ](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/vikaskarade> \"Big Thinker\") |  ![Amit Mauryaâ¨12â© Amit Maurya - CTO  ](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/amitdmaurya> \"Hardworking\")  \\n**Our team also has many reputed surgeons who clinically test and build our technologies with us.**  \\nHere are videos of our earlier BBC interview and the Y-Combinator pitch (in 2018).  \\nThe Founders  \\n---  \\n![â¨11â© Dr. Vikas Karade - CEO  ](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/vikaskarade> \"Big Thinker\")  \\n![â¨12â© Amit Maurya - CTO  ](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/amitdmaurya> \"Hardworking\")  \\n**Our team also has many reputed surgeons who clinically test and build our technologies with us.**  \\nHere are videos of our earlier BBC interview and the Y-Combinator pitch (in 2018).  \\n  * Contact us: \\n  * vikas@algosurg.com\\n ![â¨13â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.facebook.com/algosurg/>)  ![â¨14â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/algosurg-pvt-ltd?trk=top_nav_home>)\\n  * Supported by: \\n ![â¨15â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/solve.mit.edu/>)  ![â¨16â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<http:/www.intuitive-foundation.org/>)  ![â¨17â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.nesta.org.uk/>)  ![â¨18â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<http:/www.ycombinator.com/>)  ![â¨19â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<http:/iitb.ac.in>)  ![â¨20â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<http:/www.birac.nic.in/>)  ![â¨21â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/ic2.utexas.edu/>)  ![â¨22â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/entrepreneurship/programmes/ignite/>)  ![â¨23â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<http:/inno-forum.org/accelerator/>)  ![â¨24â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<http:/sineiitb.org/>)  ![â¨25â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<http:/www.dst.gov.in/>)  ![â¨26â©](http://www.algosurg.com/<http:/gyti.techpedia.in/>) \\n\\n  * Â© AlgoSurg 2024\\n\\n\\n' references_markdown='\\n\\n## References\\n\\nâ¨1â© http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.ycombinator.com/companies/algosurg-inc>: \\n* (Y-Combinator W-18) \\nâ¨2â© http://www.algosurg.com/<#intro>: Home\\nâ¨3â© http://www.algosurg.com/<#one>: What we do\\nâ¨4â© http://www.algosurg.com/<#two>: Who we are\\nâ¨5â© http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.merillife.com/>: Meril\\nâ¨6â© http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/tabplan3d.com/#/>:  Tabplan3D \\nâ¨7â© http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/youtu.be/kS-e9Gho9Ds>:  X3DPSI \\nâ¨8â© http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.appropedia.org/User:OpenSurgiSim>:  OpenSurgiSim \\nâ¨9â© http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.pitkar.com/deftfix.html>:  DeftFix \\nâ¨10â© http://www.algosurg.com/<https:/www.pitkar.com/>: SHPOPL\\nâ¨11â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/whoarewe/Vikas.jpg: ![Dr Vikas Karade is the CEO and Founder of AlgoSurg\\nâ¨12â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/whoarewe/Amit.jpg: ![Amit Maurya\\nâ¨13â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/facebook.png:  ![\\nâ¨14â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/linkedin.png:  ![\\nâ¨15â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoMit.png:  ![\\nâ¨16â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoIntuitive.png:  ![\\nâ¨17â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoNesta.png:  ![\\nâ¨18â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoYC.jpg:  ![\\nâ¨19â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoIITB.png:  ![\\nâ¨20â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoBirac.png:  ![\\nâ¨21â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoIc2.png:  ![\\nâ¨22â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoJBS.png:  ![\\nâ¨23â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoIF.png:  ![\\nâ¨24â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoSINE.png:  ![\\nâ¨25â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoDST.png:  ![\\nâ¨26â© http://www.algosurg.com/images/logos/LogoGYTI.png:  ![\\n' fit_markdown='' fit_html=''",
