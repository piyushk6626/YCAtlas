  "generated_description": "**Collectly Overview**\n\nCollectly is a healthcare fintech company founded in 2017 and based in Los Angeles, CA. A Y Combinator alumnus from Batch W17, it was established with a clear mission: to help healthcare organizations collect more money, and do it faster.\n\n### The Problem\nThe U.S. healthcare payments landscape is rife with inefficiencies—approximately 50% of out-of-pocket payments remain uncollected. Collectly was born from this insight, aiming to accelerate patient cash flow, lower the costs associated with collections, and ultimately enhance patient satisfaction.\n\n### What They Do\nTo tackle these challenges, Collectly provides an all-in-one platform tailored specifically for healthcare entities such as medical groups, urgent care centers, and billing companies. Their solutions include:\n\n1. **Digital Check-In**: Streamlines patient intake and accelerates cash flow.\n2. **In-Person Payments**: Offers POS solutions for accepting various payment forms and implementing AutoPay.\n3. **Post-Service Billing**: Automates the accounts receivable process post-visit, simplifying patient follow-ups and collections.\n\nThe company is proactive in the AI space as well, having recently released an AI assistant to help patients better understand and handle their medical bills.\n\n### Impact and Reach\nCollectly is not just a tool; it’s a game-changer. Their solutions have been shown to enable healthcare providers to collect payments up to 300% faster compared to industry averages. With more than 3,000 facilities using Collectly, they’ve reported patient payments getting processed within 1-2 weeks instead of the typical 60-90 days.\n\n### Team and Leadership\nCollectly boasts a diverse team of 89 employees, led by their Group Partner, Michael Seibel from Y Combinator. This experienced workforce is committed to changing how healthcare organizations manage their billing and collections processes.\n\n### Why It Matters\nIn a sector where financial transactions are often complex and opaque, Collectly injects clarity and efficiency, making it easier for both patients and healthcare providers. Their focus on improving patient financial experiences not only benefits the bottom lines of medical practices but also enhances patient satisfaction—a critical factor in today’s competitive healthcare environment.\n\n### In Summary\nCollectly is redefining financial workflows in healthcare by tackling the systemic issues in payment collections head-on.
