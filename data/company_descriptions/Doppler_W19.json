With a team of 25 employees, Doppler offers a centralized solution for managing, orchestrating, and governing sensitive information and non-human identities at scale. It's like a safety net for your data, no matter what tech stack you're juggling.\n\nTheir website, [doppler.com](https://doppler.com), showcases how they empower businesses to seamlessly integrate their solution with popular CI/CD tools and frameworks, enhancing security throughout the development workflow. What’s particularly cool is their user-based pricing—pay only for what you need, making it accessible to teams of all sizes without extra charges for machine identities.\n\nDoppler also emphasizes compliance and security: they've been SOC 2 verified, which is increasingly critical in today’s data-driven world. Plus, they're helping to tackle the staggering statistic that 49% of breaches involve credentials, an issue they've addressed head-on.\n\nWith over 30 billion secrets read monthly, Doppler is trusted by more than 47,000 organizations, proving its effectiveness and reliability in the realm of DevOps and security.
