  "description": "Emebedding third-party apps and websites can often be a nightmare due to incompatible platforms, security issues, and poor UX. Adding multiplayer functionality to these embeds makes this problem exponentially more difficult.\r\n\nEnter Hyperbeam—an API that lets you embed virtual computers anywhere, including web, mobile, VR, and even VSCode. You can then open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants, and add multi-user control with just a few lines of code. Uses cases and customer segments include remote learning, virtual offices, online casinos, productivity, watch parties and more.\r\n\nWe are three technical founders from the University of Waterloo, and worked as engineers at Facebook, Yahoo, and Lyft. Our technology is battle-tested–we currently stream over 1.25M hours of video per month across every continent. https://hyperbeam.com?ch=yc",

  "generated_description": "Hyperbeam is a Canadian tech startup founded in 2021 by three engineers from the University of Waterloo who previously worked at heavyweights like Facebook, Yahoo, and Lyft. Currently part of Y Combinator's Winter 2022 batch, Hyperbeam is on a mission to simplify the world of virtual collaboration by providing an API that enables developers to embed shared, embeddable web browsers into their applications.\n\nThe problem they're tackling is significant: integrating third-party apps and websites can turn into a convoluted mess filled with compatibility and security issues. Hyperbeam’s solution? A virtual computer that you can easily plug into your web, mobile, or even VR experiences. This isn't just about display; their API allows you to synchronize audio and video seamlessly across multiple users, and offers multi-user control without complicated setups—just a few lines of code to get started.\n\nHyperbeam’s use cases are plentiful: it’s perfect for remote learning, virtual workspaces, online casinos, and even movie watch parties. With over 1.25 million hours streamed each month globally, it's clear there's a real demand for what they're offering.\n\nThe team is compact, consisting of just three dedicated members, allowing them to remain agile and focused. They’re also backed by experienced investors like Aaron Epstein, which is a testament to their potential in the competitive developer-tools space.\n\nOne feature that stands out is ease of integration. Whether you're looking to build a collaborative workspace or an online social space, Hyperbeam aims to handle the backend complexity, letting you focus on user experience and functionality. With offerings like free usage of up to 10,000 minutes per month, it’s designed to meet the needs of both small developers and larger enterprises.\n\nOverall, Hyperbeam is channeling a significant shift towards making collaboration more intuitive and less frustrating, embracing a future where remote interactions feel as real and seamless as being in the same room."
