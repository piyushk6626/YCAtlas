  "generated_description": "**Delee: Revolutionizing Cancer Detection with Blood Testing Technology**\n\nFounded in 2017 and based in Monterrey, Mexico, Delee is a pioneering medical device company on a mission to transform early cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. They leverage cutting-edge technology to isolate and analyze circulating tumor cells (CTCs), enabling more timely and accurate cancer detection.\n\nAs part of Y Combinator's Batch W17, Delee's small-but-mighty team of 18 is well-placed to harness innovation in the diagnostics space. Their flagship products are the **CytoCatch™ Isolation Platform** and the **CytoCatch™ Imaging System**. These devices stand out for their fully automated processes, promising outstanding recovery rates—over 97%—when isolating CTCs from various cancer types, including prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.\n\n### Key Features\n- **CytoCatch™ Isolation Platform**: This innovative device excels in the reliable and reproducible isolation of CTCs, completely removing human error from the equation. It’s designed for high efficiency, making it an ideal solution for researchers and clinicians alike.\n  \n- **CytoCatch™ Imaging System**: This platform employs sophisticated computer vision and machine learning algorithms to accurately classify isolated CTCs. It's fully customizable, allowing researchers to tweak the components to better suit their experiments.\n\nDelee aims to push the limits of cancer research by offering customizable antibody panels and compatibility with modern molecular biology techniques, including next-generation sequencing. They’re not just isolating cells; they’re enabling an entirely new frontier in understanding cancer at the genetic level. \n\nIn a landscape that's often bogged down by complexity, Delee sets itself apart with a clear vision: leveraging technology to tackle one of the most daunting challenges in healthcare—cancer. For anyone interested in early cancer diagnosis or working at the intersection of technology and medicine, Delee is definitely a name to follow. \n\nTo learn more about their offerings, you can visit their website at [Delee.co](http://www.delee.co)."
