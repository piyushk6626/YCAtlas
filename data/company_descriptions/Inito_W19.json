Inito also shows you the charts and actual values of all 4 hormones.\\n  * ###### How many test strips are required per cycle?\\nThe number of tests depends on the irregularity and length of your cycles. For someone with an average cycle length of 30 days, 12-15 tests may be required to track and confirm ovulation.\\n  * ###### Where can I get more refill strips? Do I need to buy a new monitor every cycle?\\nBoxes of strips are available in the ‘shop’ tab in the Inito app. You don’t need to purchase the monitor again.\\n  * ###### Do I need to use a test strip for each hormone?\\nNo. Inito is the only fertility monitor that measures Estrogen, LH, PdG (urine metabolite of progesterone) and FSH on a single test strip.\\n  * ###### Will Inito work if I have PCOS?\\nEvery woman is unique, especially with a condition like PCOS, which can influence hormone levels. Inito shows you a full picture of your cycle, which can help you identify your fertile days and confirm ovulation.\\n  * ###### Do medications affect the results?\\nFertility medications or other drugs that influence your hormones can prevent Inito from giving you accurate results. You will still be able to see your hormone patterns via the App.\\n  * ###### Can I use HSA benefits to purchase Inito?\\nYes!\\n  * ###### What is Inito\\'s regulatory status in the US?\\nThe Inito Fertility Monitor is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class I medical device that is exempt from FDA\\'s premarket notification submission requirements. The registration status should not be misunderstood as suggesting that the Inito Fertility Monitor has been reviewed, cleared or approved by FDA. \\n  * ###### Are there any limits to specific hormone thresholds?\\nInito is designed to read all kinds of drops and surges in hormone levels. However, the set limits of measurement for E3G is 600 ng/ml, PdG is 40 ug/ml, and FSH & LH is 40 mIU/ml. \\n\\n\\n1. Inito measures PdG, a metabolite of progesterone.

Inito also shows you the charts and actual values of all 4 hormones.\\n  * ###### How many test strips are required per cycle?\\nThe number of tests depends on the irregularity and length of your cycles. For someone with an average cycle length of 30 days, 12-15 tests may be required to track and confirm ovulation.\\n  * ###### Where can I get more refill strips? Do I need to buy a new monitor every cycle?\\nBoxes of strips are available in the ‘shop’ tab in the Inito app. You don’t need to purchase the monitor again.\\n  * ###### Do I need to use a test strip for each hormone?\\nNo. Inito is the only fertility monitor that measures Estrogen, LH, PdG (urine metabolite of progesterone) and FSH on a single test strip.\\n  * ###### Will Inito work if I have PCOS?\\nEvery woman is unique, especially with a condition like PCOS, which can influence hormone levels. Inito shows you a full picture of your cycle, which can help you identify your fertile days and confirm ovulation.\\n  * ###### Do medications affect the results?\\nFertility medications or other drugs that influence your hormones can prevent Inito from giving you accurate results. You will still be able to see your hormone patterns via the App.\\n  * ###### Can I use HSA benefits to purchase Inito?\\nYes!\\n  * ###### What is Inito\\'s regulatory status in the US?\\nThe Inito Fertility Monitor is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class I medical device that is exempt from FDA\\'s premarket notification submission requirements. The registration status should not be misunderstood as suggesting that the Inito Fertility Monitor has been reviewed, cleared or approved by FDA. \\n  * ###### Are there any limits to specific hormone thresholds?\\nInito is designed to read all kinds of drops and surges in hormone levels. However, the set limits of measurement for E3G is 600 ng/ml, PdG is 40 ug/ml, and FSH & LH is 40 mIU/ml. \\n\\n\\n1. Inito measures PdG, a metabolite of progesterone.

  "generated_description": "### Inito: Empowering Fertility Tracking from Home\n\n**Website:** [Inito.com](https://www.inito.com/)\n\n**Location:** Bengaluru, India\n\n---\n\nInito is revolutionizing the way women monitor their reproductive health by enabling at-home hormone tracking. Their mission centers on improving self-care through innovative technology that simplifies fertility management. With a dedicated team of around 100 employees and the backing of Y Combinator’s W19 batch, Inito is carving out a niche in the burgeoning fertility-tech and health-tech sectors.\n\n#### What Makes Inito Unique?\n\nAt its core, Inito operates as an all-in-one fertility monitor, measuring four crucial hormones—Estrogen, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Progesterone (as PdG), and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)—all on a single test strip. Unlike conventional ovulation tests that typically provide binary “yes/no” results based merely on LH spikes, Inito gives detailed insights into hormone levels, helping women pinpoint their most fertile windows.\n\nIn just **10 minutes**, users can dip a test strip in urine, attach it to their smartphone (currently compatible with iPhone 7 and later), and receive personalized, actionable data. This data not only aids in predicting ovulation but also in confirming it, giving users a clearer picture of their fertility cycles. \n\n#### Why Choose Inito?\n\n- **Comprehensive Hormone Tracking:** Inito is the only fertility monitor that tracks all four hormones simultaneously, providing a more nuanced understanding of menstrual cycles.\n- **User-Friendly App:** The accompanying app simplifies the tracking process, sending notifications about test days, results, and confirmed ovulation.\n- **Trusted by Couples:** With over 20,000 couples relying on Inito, testimonials highlight successful pregnancies facilitated by accurate hormone monitoring.\n\n#### Key Features:\n\n- **Real-Time Data**: Offers numerical values for hormone levels instead of generic readings, essential for those with irregular cycles.\n- **Effective Confirmation**: Helps confirm ovulation through sustained PdG levels, which are critical for successful conception.\n- **HSA/FSA Eligible**: This makes it easier for users in the U.S. to afford fertility testing.\n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions:\n\n- **What results does Inito provide?**\n  Inito delivers results such as High Fertility, Peak Fertility, and Ovulation Confirmed, along with charts of hormone levels.\n  \n- **How many test strips are needed per cycle?**\n  This varies; an average cycle might require 12-15 tests. \n\n- **Can I use HSA benefits?**\n  Yes, Inito is eligible for HSA purchases.\n\n- **Is it FDA approved?**\n  It’s registered as a Class I medical device in the U.S., exempt from many premarket requirements, though it has not been explicitly cleared or approved.\n\nInito is more than just a product; it’s a tool that empowers women to understand their bodies better and enhance their chances of conception. Whether you’re actively trying to conceive or simply wanting to keep track of your hormonal health, Inito provides an insightful, data-driven approach to fertility monitoring.\n\nFor anyone interested in leveraging technology for better reproductive health, Inito is certainly worth considering.
