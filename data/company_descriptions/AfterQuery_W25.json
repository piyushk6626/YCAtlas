Think of the working professionals at top firms and the smartest students in various subjects (PhDs). Then, whenever our clients have a request for a certain type of data, we will construct and lead a team to produce: fine-tuning data, RLHF data, benchmarks, etc.\r\n\nWe’ve already started in finance, illustrating the importance of high-quality data in our paper posted here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18062.",
