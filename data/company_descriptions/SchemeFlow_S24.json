  "generated_description": "**SchemeFlow: Revolutionizing Construction Project Approvals**\n\nFounded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, SchemeFlow is on a mission to streamline the often convoluted process of gaining government approvals for construction projects. At its core, SchemeFlow harnesses the power of AI to drastically cut down the time it takes to generate the necessary technical reports—reducing what once required months to mere minutes.\n\nThe company was born from the partnership of two brothers and a high school friend, each bringing a unique skill set: a Mayor’s Chief of Staff skilled in navigating bureaucracy, a construction engineer from Arup, and an AI software engineer. This trifecta combines industry knowledge with technical prowess, forming the ideal team to tackle the complexities of construction regulations.\n\nUsing advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), SchemeFlow has already accomplished the impressive feat of generating over 10,000 pages of report documentation for more than 400 projects—including car parks, hotels, and office buildings. The resulting time savings are staggering: up to 97%. This efficiency is attractive not just for construction firms, but for the consultants who aid them.\n\nInitially launched in the UK, SchemeFlow quickly pivoted to target the U.S. market, where there’s a staggering $9 billion opportunity. There are approximately 143,000 consultants currently involved in report writing, which SchemeFlow can significantly benefit, or there’s an even larger $23 billion potential on a global scale.\n\nLocated in San Francisco with a compact team of four, SchemeFlow is making waves in the domains of generative AI, government technology (govtech), and proptech. They’re currently engaged in automating the drafting of crucial technical reports for various sectors such as transportation, environment, and economic development.\n\nWith a clear focus and ambitious plans, SchemeFlow stands ready to transform the landscape of construction project approvals. If you’re interested in learning more, you can visit their website at [www.schemeflow.com](https://www.schemeflow.com). With key partners like Tom Blomfield and a passion for impactful technology, keep an eye on SchemeFlow—they're poised to change the game."
