A proud part of Y Combinator's S20 batch, Ukama operates with a dedicated team of seven who are passionate about democratizing connectivity. \n\n**Mission & Vision**\n\nThe core mission of Ukama is straightforward yet transformative: to make cellular internet accessible to all. They achieve this through innovative \"cellular Internet in a box\" solutions, designed to simplify the setup of personal or community-wide networks. If you’re dissatisfied with current connectivity options or facing coverage challenges, Ukama invites you to run your own secure and affordable network.\n\n**Key Offerings**\n\nUkama offers an open access, complete cellular network solution without the hefty costs and technical barriers usually associated with traditional systems. Whether you're looking to start your own internet service provider business or connect your community, their kits streamline the process, allowing users to focus on what they do best.\n\n- **Products**: \n  - Cellular Internet in a box\n  - Open access and decentralized technology stack\n\nThis makes it easy to establish long-range, secure connections with minimal hassle.\n\n**Connect with Ukama**\n\nThey actively encourage community involvement and contributions, especially from those who share a love for open-source technologies.
