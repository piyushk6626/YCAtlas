  "description": "Infracost shifts cloud costs left and makes FinOps proactive. It sits in the engineering workflow (CI/CD), and shows the cost impact of code changes (IaC) before the code is shipped to production. This catches costly mistakes before any money has been spent. It also checks to make sure all resources are tagged with your set tagging policy, and runs checks on the code against our FinOps policy packs, ensuring best practices are followed (e.g. GP2 volumes should be GP3).\r\n\nThis creates a cost-aware engineering culture.",

  "generated_description": "Infracost, founded in 2020 and based in Edinburgh, UK, is a Y Combinator W21 graduate that's making waves in the FinOps space. Their mission is straightforward yet powerful: \"Shift FinOps Left.\" Essentially, they empower engineers by revealing the cost implications of code changes before those changes hit production. Think of it as the financial safety net for cloud infrastructure management.\n\nHere's the scoop: Infracost integrates seamlessly into existing CI/CD workflows, analyzing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for cloud cost impacts *before* anything is deployed. This proactive approach helps catch potential budget-busting mistakes right at the source. Engineers get to see how their code will affect cloud costs and can adjust accordingly. Plus, the tool enforces best practices by checking for compliance with tagging policies and prompts developers to consider more cost-effective options, like upgrading from GP2 to GP3 volumes.\n\nThe team at Infracost is compact, comprising around 10 talented individuals who are committed to creating a cost-aware engineering culture. They’ve quickly attracted a user base—including over 3,000 companies—spanning industries like finance, automotive, and technology, many of which are Fortune 2000 enterprises.\n\nWhat’s more, Infracost is SOC2 Type 2 certified, which is a big deal for enterprise customers looking for robust security practices. With the backing of notable investors, including Y Combinator and Sequoia Capital, Infracost is positioning itself as an essential tool for companies looking to integrate cost management into their DevOps processes.\n\nFor those interested in diving deeper, you can explore their offerings at [infracost.io](https://infracost.io). Whether you're a developer wanting to keep a tighter grip on cloud expenditures or a finance professional aiming to optimize your company's cloud strategy, Infracost is poised to be a pivotal player in this space."
