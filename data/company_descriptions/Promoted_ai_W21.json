  "generated_description": "**Promoted.ai Overview**\n\nFounded in 2020 and an alumnus of Y Combinator’s W21 batch, Promoted.ai is making a significant dent in the marketplace world by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence for search and advertising. Based in the tech hub of San Francisco, the tight-knit team of 12 engineers—drawn from giants like Google, Meta, and Pinterest—focuses on enhancing the relevance and revenue of online marketplaces.\n\n### Mission and Vision\nPromoted.ai’s mission is clear: to dramatically improve search and advertising for marketplaces, ultimately connecting buyers and sellers in a more meaningful way. They aim to deliver \"shockingly better relevance,\" touting a potential revenue increase of up to 10% through innovations that blend traditional machine learning with cutting-edge generative AI technology.\n\n### Core Offerings\nPromoted.ai specializes in:\n\n- **Search Optimization**: Improving the quality of search functions in marketplaces to help users find exactly what they need efficiently.\n- **Native Ads Solutions**: Designing advertisements that perform seamlessly within the user experience, akin to organic content.\n- **Feed Ranking Improvements**: Ensuring that product listings are optimized based on user behavior and search queries.\n\nThe company has a strong client list that includes well-known names like Eventbrite, Upwork, and Outschool, underscoring its capability to cater to both publicly traded and late-stage marketplace companies.\n\n### Why It Matters\nIn a world where attention is fleeting, Promoted.ai aims to solve the core pain points that online marketplaces face—relevance in search results and ad performance. By offering solutions that are not just about generating traffic but ensuring the traffic converts, they address a fundamental issue affecting revenue streams for marketplaces.\n\n### Notable Achievements\nPromoted.ai has demonstrated impressive results with its clients:\n- **Hipcamp** saw an 11% increase in guest-to-host conversions.\n- **Outschool** realized a 16% boost in revenue through better matchmaking between teachers and learners.\n- **RVshare** experienced a remarkable 25% increase in booking rates.\n\nThese testimonials speak volumes about the effectiveness and potential of their technology.\n\n### Team and Leadership\nMichael Seibel, a prominent figure in the startup ecosystem and partner at Y Combinator, serves as a group partner. The strength of the team not only lies in their technical skills but also in their innovative approach to solving complex problems.\n\n### The Road Ahead\nPromoted.ai is not just about product features—it’s about building lasting relationships between buyers and sellers.
