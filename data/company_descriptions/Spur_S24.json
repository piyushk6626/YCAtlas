If you have questions, we’re here to answer them.\\n[Book a Demo](https://www.spurtest.com/<#book-a-demo>)\\nWhat is the onboarding process?\\nOnboarding is extremely simple on Spur — since we do not require access to your codebase, all you need to provide is a public URL to start writing your first test.We onboard customers in two steps: first, hop on a [call](https://www.spurtest.com/<#book-a-demo>) with us to help us understand your requirements, and we\\'ll onboard you on the next call and get you set up in no time!\\nHow does the Spur Agent work?\\nThe Spur Agent is a **vision-first** , multi-modal agent. This means that your tests are not reliant on CSS selectors, unlike tests written in web-automation frameworks like Playwright or Selenium. This allows your tests to be more reliable, and reduces the chances of false-positives — so you can focus on shipping faster!\\nWhat kind of flows do you support?\\nWe can support any action that happens within the Browser window—no matter how complex your use case is. The Spur Agent interacts with the browser just like any human does! \\nDo I need to know how to code to use Spur?\\nNo! Spur is a no-code test platform — this means that all tests can be written in Natural Language. Whether you are a PM, CTO, Engineer or QA — anyone can write tests on Spur.\\nCan we test APIs through Spur?\\nYes! We have API testing support for tests! You can call, store, and verify the response of any APIs in Spur — including ones that are dynamically generated. \\n## Book a demo to learn more about Spur\\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4be7708e9427c1db39dfc_Footer%20Logo.png)](https://www.spurtest.com/<#home>)\\nCopyright © 2025 Spur All rights reserved.\\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4bf09f653a81e9491ff11_LinkedIn%20Icon.svg)](https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/spur-test/>)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4befc76ec8eb282e7337a_TwitterX.svg)](https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/x.com/spur_dev>)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4befc90d027f8e64b8d6d_Email.svg)\\n' markdown_with_citations='Discover How We 20x\\'d Wander.com\\'s Release Velocity⟨1⟩\\n![⟨2⟩](https://www.spurtest.com/</>)\\nHome⟨3⟩\\nCareers⟨4⟩\\nLink⟨5⟩\\nSign In⟨5⟩\\n# Yo\\n### Spur lets you test your website with Natural Language.\\nBook a Demo⟨6⟩Sign Up⟨7⟩\\n#### Backed by\\n![⟨8⟩](https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/www.ycombinator.com/>)![⟨9⟩](https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/firstround.com/>)![⟨10⟩](https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/pear.vc/>)![⟨11⟩](https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/neo.com/>)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66ca9bb672f1594d103b2484_Spir%20Webclip.png)\\n### Trusted by top companies\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/677deeab2d1d8a99efc1e0ec_terrakotta%20logo.png)\\n“I’m gonna see if I can expense Spur through my wellness stipend.

This means that your tests are not reliant on CSS selectors, unlike tests written in web-automation frameworks like Playwright or Selenium. This allows your tests to be more reliable, and reduces the chances of false-positives — so you can focus on shipping faster!\\nWhat kind of flows do you support?\\nWe can support any action that happens within the Browser window—no matter how complex your use case is. The Spur Agent interacts with the browser just like any human does! \\nDo I need to know how to code to use Spur?\\nNo! Spur is a no-code test platform — this means that all tests can be written in Natural Language. Whether you are a PM, CTO, Engineer or QA — anyone can write tests on Spur.\\nCan we test APIs through Spur?\\nYes! We have API testing support for tests! You can call, store, and verify the response of any APIs in Spur — including ones that are dynamically generated. \\n## Book a demo to learn more about Spur\\n![⟨16⟩](https://www.spurtest.com/<#home>)\\nCopyright © 2025 Spur All rights reserved.\\n![⟨17⟩](https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/spur-test/>)![⟨18⟩](https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/x.com/spur_dev>)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4befc90d027f8e64b8d6d_Email.svg)\\n' references_markdown=\"\\n\\n## References\\n\\n⟨1⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/<http:/www.spurtest.com/case-studies/wander>: Discover How We 20x'd Wander.com's Release Velocity\\n⟨2⟩ https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4b0f0324137d15f57d86f_Spur%20Logo.png: ![\\n⟨3⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/</>: Home\\n⟨4⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/</careers>: Careers\\n⟨5⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/app.spurtest.com/homepage>: Link\\n⟨6⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/<#book-a-demo>: Book a Demo\\n⟨7⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/tally.so/r/n9WR4Q>: Sign Up\\n⟨8⟩ https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4b2f76b760921deb37b14_yc.png: ![\\n⟨9⟩ https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/677df61e6776d67bb5ba2d0f_first-round-primary-logo-blk.png: ![\\n⟨10⟩ https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/677df60e7108ec1ebad6af25_Pear_VC_logo.svg.png: ![\\n⟨11⟩ https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/677e00d42a2ea7d002a540f3_neo.svg: ![\\n⟨12⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/twitter.com/spur_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>: @spur_dev\\n⟨13⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/twitter.com/sneha8sivakumar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>: @sneha8sivakumar\\n⟨14⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/t.co/1he1RF9K3U>: pic.twitter.com/1he1RF9K3U\\n⟨15⟩ https://www.spurtest.com/<https:/twitter.com/ycombinator/status/1825974215796744506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>: August 20, 2024\\n⟨16⟩ https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4be7708e9427c1db39dfc_Footer%20Logo.png: ![\\n⟨17⟩ https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4bf09f653a81e9491ff11_LinkedIn%20Icon.svg: ![\\n⟨18⟩ https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c3e4ffe16480b253b3458d/66c4befc76ec8eb282e7337a_TwitterX.svg: ![\\n\" fit_markdown='' fit_html=''",
  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Spur**\n\nFounded in 2024 and hailing from Y Combinator Batch S24, Spur is transforming how businesses conduct quality assurance (QA) testing. Located in the heart of San Francisco, this ambitious startup operates with a lean team of just four employees. Their mission is simple yet profound: \"Spur is your AI QA Engineer. Test your websites with natural language.\" \n\nThe concept behind Spur is to streamline and automate the testing process, allowing users to generate tests effortlessly—no coding required. In essence, they eliminate the need for manual testing or hiring external QA teams.\n\n**How It Works:**\nSpur stands out because it uses natural language processing to create automated tests. Users can describe what they want to test, and Spur handles the technical intricacies. This AI-driven approach means tests adapt automatically to changes in a website's user interface. Forget about the days of wrestling with brittle CSS selectors! Spur significantly reduces maintenance overhead and truly democratizes testing, making it accessible to team members across all levels—from developers to product managers.\n\n**Notable Achievements:**\nSpur has already demonstrated its capabilities by helping clients like Wander.com increase their release velocity significantly—by up to 20 times! Testimonials from early adopters—including companies like Figma, Stack, and Polymet—indicate that they've achieved impressive efficiencies by integrating Spur into their workflows.\n\n**Partnerships and Backing:**\nBacked by notable investors like Jared Friedman and driven by its innovative tool, Spur has gained traction among tech-forward startups looking to optimize their testing processes. Their tool plays nicely within CI/CD pipelines, making it a go-to option for product teams keen on ensuring high-quality software.\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nWith the tech landscape continuously evolving, manual testing can be an overwhelming bottleneck for startups and scale-ups alike. Spur is tackling this challenge head-on, offering a no-code solution that not only speeds up testing but also enhances reliability. \n\nIn summary, Spur is making waves in the developer tools space by redefining how quality assurance can be conducted—efficiently, intuitively, and without the need for extensive technical skills. If you're in the market for an AI-powered, user-friendly testing solution, checking out their demo may be well worth your time. \n\n**Want to learn more?** Visit their website at [spurtest.com](https://www.spurtest.com/) to explore their offerings and book a demo."
