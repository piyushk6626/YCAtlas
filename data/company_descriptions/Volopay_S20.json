  "description": "Volopay is a modern spend management platform that saves companies time and money by giving visibility & control to every aspect of business spending. With Volopay, finance and accounting teams can control expense requests and approvals, make bill payments (domestic/cross-border), manage company cards, and reconcile all accounting on one platform.\r\n\nVolopay completely eliminates the need for expense reports and reimbursements while giving everyone in the company a card to use. We worked in an offshore dev centre in the past and it took 2 months to get our reimbursements and 4 weeks to make any purchase as there was just one corporate card for the entire company and clunky bill payments solutions offered by the banks. \r\n\nAmong our customers are Reddoorz (OYO of South East Asia), Dathena (biggest data security co in Singapore) and Beam (APAC’s leading micro-mobility player).",
