  "description": "We're a SaaS company with emphasis on Service, and we have a mission:  to improve the happiness of scientists and the quality of their research. \r\n\nHappiLabs provides a service called the Virtual Lab Manager. We offer PhD level, former scientists to help with safety and regulatory, product research, lab shopping, negotiating, purchasing, inventory, and bookkeeping. Our software tools, such as the ETA Dashboard and the HappiApp, make it easy to request purchases, manage inventory, and check-in packages upon delivery. HappiLabs also has one of the most extensive databases of product prices. These tools, and experienced humans, make us the smartest lab managers in the world.\r\n\nAnother way to think of us is an outsourced purchasing department and/or a personal assistant for your scientists.  \r\n\nBased in Chicago, and some presence in San Francisco.\r\n\nIf you're a newly funded PI, a startup, small biotech, or work with purchasing as a big pharma/biotech, you can use our help.",

  "generated_description": "### HappiLabs: Revolutionizing Lab Management \n\n**Overview**\n\nFounded in 2012 and backed by Y Combinator's Batch S18, HappiLabs set out with a clear mission: to bring happiness to scientists and enhance the quality of their research. Based in Chicago, with a footprint in San Francisco, the company employs 14 team members, including experienced former scientists who understand the day-to-day realities of laboratory management.\n\n**What They Do**\n\nHappiLabs has created a service they call the **Virtual Lab Manager**. Essentially, they're like outsourced purchasing departments or personal assistants for scientists. Their team comprises PhD-level professionals who help manage a variety of critical functions including:\n\n- Compliance with safety and regulatory standards\n- Product research and procurement\n- Inventory management\n- Negotiation and purchasing\n- Bookkeeping and accounting support\n\nIn addition to human expertise, HappiLabs provides innovative software tools like the **ETA Dashboard** and **HappiApp** to streamline requests, track inventory, and manage deliveries. They boast one of the most extensive databases of product prices, ensuring clients get the best deals.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nTheir services are designed for newly funded Principal Investigators (PIs), startups, small biotech companies, and larger pharmaceutical firms looking to streamline their purchasing processes. \n\n**Why It Matters**\n\nBy alleviating the administrative burdens of lab management, HappiLabs allows scientists to focus on what they're trained to do: conduct impactful research. The mental clarity and efficiency that comes from outsourcing logistical tasks can't be overstated. As Tom Ruginis, the CEO, humorously puts it, “We're like a happiness molecule, but we bind to your lab.”\n\n**Market Position & Tags**\n\nHappiLabs operates in the intersection of science and technology, categorized under assistive tech, smart home assistants, and warehouse management tech. This positioning indicates a forward-thinking approach to integrating innovative technology with traditional scientific practices.\n\n**Client Testimonials**\n\nTheir clients rave about the experience, with feedback from industry leaders highlighting significant time and cost savings. For example, Jacob Glanville, CEO of Centivax, notes how essential HappiLabs was in scaling his previous startup and emphasizes the value they bring to biotech startups.\n\n**The Bottom Line**\n\nIf you're grappling with managing a lab's purchasing and logistics, or simply want to improve your lab's efficiency, HappiLabs might be the perfect partner. They're not merely a service provider; they are advocates for scientists, dedicated to enhancing the research experience. \n\nFor more information on their offerings, visit their [website](https://www.happilabs.org/)."
