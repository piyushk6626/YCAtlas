For any other questions or concerns:\\nSend an email to support@pragmaticleaders.io\\n## 16. Legal Disputes\\nMost disputes can be easily resolved by communication, so before bringing a formal legal case, please first follow the Support matrix mentioned in the above section. If that doesn\u2019t work and you live in the United States or Canada, your options are to go to small claims court or bring a claim in binding arbitration; you may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a non-individual class action claim against us.\\nThis Dispute Resolution section applies only if you live in the United States or Canada.\\na. Small Claims\\nEither of us can bring a claim in small claims court in (a) San Francisco, California, (b) the county where you live, or (c) another place we both agree on, as long as it qualifies to be brought in that court.\\nb. Going to Arbitration\\nIf we can\u2019t resolve our dispute amicably, you and Truemerit agree to resolve any claims related to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to go to arbitration (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.\\nc. The Arbitration Process\\nAny disputes that involve a claim of less than $10,000 USD must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration must initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. You and we agree that the following rules will apply to the proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions (at the choice of the party seeking relief); (b) the arbitration must not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree otherwise); and (c) any judgment on the arbitrator\u2019s rendered award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdiction. Disputes that involve a claim of more than $10,000 USD must be resolved per the AAA\u2019s rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be in-person.\\nd. No Class Actions\\nWe both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis. This means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can\u2019t combine multiple people\u2019s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s case can only impact that user, not other users, and can\u2019t be used to decide other users\u2019 disputes. If a court decides that this \u201cNo class actions\u201d clause isn\u2019t enforceable or valid, then this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.\\n## 17. Electronic Communication Policy\\nTruemerit is required to provide you with certain information in writing. This Electronic Communications Policy describes how we\u2019ll provide that information to you.\\n  1.

Delivery of Information\\n\\n\\nTruemerit may provide you with Electronic Communications by (a) emailing them to you at the email address listed in your Truemerit account, (b) posting them on the Truemerit website or mobile applications, or (c) making them available via a website designated in an email notice to you.\\n  1. Withdrawing Consent for Electronic Communications\\n\\n\\nYou may withdraw your consent to receive Electronic Communications at any time by submitting a request to us at support@pragmaticleaders.io\\nNote that if you withdraw your consent to receive Electronic Communications, such withdrawal will only be effective after Truemerit has had a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal (usually 3 months). Additionally, if you withdraw your consent to receive Electronic Communications, and Truemerit is required to send you paper copies of communications, Truemerit may cancel your access to the Services.\\nIn order for Truemerit to send you paper copies, you must have a current mailing address on file in your Truemeritaccount.

Term and Termination\\nSubject to this Section, these Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services.\\nWe would hate to see you go! but if that situation arises We may (a) suspend your rights to use the Site and/or Services (including your Account) or (b) terminate these Terms, at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use of the Services in violation of these Terms. Upon termination of these Terms, your Account and right to access and use the Services will terminate immediately. You understand that any termination of your Account involves deletion of your User Content from our live databases. We will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of these Terms, including for termination of your Account or deletion of your User Content. Upon termination of these Terms, all of the provisions will terminate except those that by their nature should survive.\\nIf you choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information and your use of the Services you may do so at any time by permanently closing and deleting your account. If your account does not have any open issues such as unpaid bills, in-complete services, unresolved cases, or policy violations, you will receive an email with instructions to confirm your deletion request. This process may take up to approximately two weeks after which your account will be deleted to the extent permitted.

Support Process\\nWe are dedicated to providing the best of Services the best they can be, but we\u2019re not perfect and sometimes things can go wrong.\\nOur world-class Support team is standing by, and is committed to resolving any issues that come our way. Our support procedures are primarily to help facilitate the transaction between Users and to protect the integrity of our platform so that our Users have a pleasant experience. In no way is the provision of these procedures or payments issued by Truemerit, under these procedures an admission of any liability of Truemerit.\\na. For payment related issues:\\nSend an email to accounts@pragmaticleaders.io\\nb. For refund related issues:\\nSend an email to success@pragmaticleaders.io\\nc. For any other questions or concerns:\\nSend an email to support@pragmaticleaders.io\\n## 16. Legal Disputes\\nMost disputes can be easily resolved by communication, so before bringing a formal legal case, please first follow the Support matrix mentioned in the above section. If that doesn\u2019t work and you live in the United States or Canada, your options are to go to small claims court or bring a claim in binding arbitration; you may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a non-individual class action claim against us.\\nThis Dispute Resolution section applies only if you live in the United States or Canada.\\na. Small Claims\\nEither of us can bring a claim in small claims court in (a) San Francisco, California, (b) the county where you live, or (c) another place we both agree on, as long as it qualifies to be brought in that court.\\nb. Going to Arbitration\\nIf we can\u2019t resolve our dispute amicably, you and Truemerit agree to resolve any claims related to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to go to arbitration (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.\\nc. The Arbitration Process\\nAny disputes that involve a claim of less than $10,000 USD must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration must initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. You and we agree that the following rules will apply to the proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions (at the choice of the party seeking relief); (b) the arbitration must not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree otherwise); and (c) any judgment on the arbitrator\u2019s rendered award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdiction. Disputes that involve a claim of more than $10,000 USD must be resolved per the AAA\u2019s rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be in-person.\\nd. No Class Actions\\nWe both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis. This means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can\u2019t combine multiple people\u2019s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s case can only impact that user, not other users, and can\u2019t be used to decide other users\u2019 disputes. If a court decides that this \u201cNo class actions\u201d clause isn\u2019t enforceable or valid, then this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.\\n## 17. Electronic Communication Policy\\nTruemerit is required to provide you with certain information in writing. This Electronic Communications Policy describes how we\u2019ll provide that information to you.\\n  1. Information Truemerit Will Send You\\n\\n\\nTruemerit will sometimes need to send you important messages about your use of Truemerit\u2019s website, mobile apps, or other services (collectively, our \u201cServices\u201d).

Withdrawing Consent for Electronic Communications\\n\\n\\nYou may withdraw your consent to receive Electronic Communications at any time by submitting a request to us at support@pragmaticleaders.io\\nNote that if you withdraw your consent to receive Electronic Communications, such withdrawal will only be effective after Truemerit has had a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal (usually 3 months).
