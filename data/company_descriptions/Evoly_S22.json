  "generated_description": "### Evoly: The Future of Smart Metering\n\nEvoly is shaking up the utility sector with its innovative approach to smart electric and water metering. Founded in 2021 and proudly emerging from Y Combinator's Batch S22, Evoly is on a mission to provide smart metering solutions as a service to utility companies. Its headquarters might be in Remote, OR, but its impact is anything but remote—it's revolutionizing how utilities measure and manage consumption.\n\n#### What Sets Evoly Apart?\n\nAt the heart of Evoly's offering is a smart metering system that goes beyond basic consumption measurement. While traditional meters simply log usage, Evoly's smart meters send real-time data wirelessly to utilities. This means they get a comprehensive 24/7 view of their grid, helping them act swiftly based on accurate information. \n\nEvoly's system is notably cost-effective—up to five times cheaper than conventional solutions. By saving utilities over $4 million annually, they’re not just improving efficiency; they’re bolstering the bottom line.\n\n#### Key Features\n\nEvoly’s smart meters offer a rich set of functionalities, including:\n- **Remote meter reading**: No more manual inspections.\n- **Fraud detection**: Identify discrepancies and minimize losses.\n- **Remote control**: Utilities can turn electricity on and off without physical intervention.\n- **Time-of-use pricing**: Enhancing pricing strategies based on real-time usage.\n\nThese capabilities are crucial in today’s climate-conscious economy, making Evoly a key player in the energy sector.\n\n#### The Team Behind Evoly\n\nWith a compact team of just four, Evoly is making waves in the climate and energy tags. The group is led by seasoned professionals, including Gustaf Alstromer, an influential Group Partner guiding their strategic vision.\n\n#### Connect with Evoly\n\nIf you are a utility looking to upgrade your metering system, Evoly offers a plug-and-play solution that is easy to install and deploy. You can explore their offerings or even book a demo through their website: [Evoly Energy](https://www.evolyenergy.com).\n\nIn a world that increasingly demands innovation in energy management, Evoly is not just evolving—it's powering the future of smart utilities."
