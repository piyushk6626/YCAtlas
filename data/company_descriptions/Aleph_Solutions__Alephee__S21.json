  "description": "Aleph helps companies with thousands of products like General Motors and Bosch increase their revenue in Latin America by listing their inventory on large e-commerce sites like Mercado Libre and Amazon. Our customers sell over U$D 4M dollars’ worth of product every month using our software.\r\n\nMany brands struggle with the shift to sell on marketplaces. They want resellers to be involved in their online sales strategies, but both still need to maintain 10,000 products, prices and inventory up-to-date across digital channels and Marketplaces do not provide tools to help brands and resellers on the journey.\r\n\nAleph is the best way for brands and wholesalers to replicate their offline network of resellers online. With Aleph, Brands create high-quality product catalogs to share with their resellers. Now, any seller can access their product catalogue and sell on marketplaces.",
