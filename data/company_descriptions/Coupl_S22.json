  "description": "Coupl is India's first neobank for couples. \r\nWe help couples easily manage their shared payments.\r\n\nWhile Indian couples have evolved over the last 20 years, the traditional joint account hasn't.\r\n\nToday, young Indian couples start sharing payments well before tying the knot. They use multiple tools to budget, split, track and settle expenses. They also prefer a quick and digital banking experience. \r\nHowever, the traditional joint account is still only accessible to married couples, takes days to open and is very limited in its expense management features & user experience.\r\n\nCoupl lets any young couple (regardless of their marital status) open a digital joint wallet in under 60 seconds using the mobile app - without ever having to visit a physical bank branch.\r\nCustomers can use the Coupl wallet to pool in money together and pay for shared expenses using our RuPay cards.",

  "generated_description": "### Coupl: India‚Äôs First Neobank for Couples\n\n**Overview**  \nFounded in 2022 and incubated in the Y Combinator Batch S22, Coupl has emerged as India's pioneering neobank dedicated to modern couples. Located in Bengaluru, this eight-person team is on a mission to redefine how couples manage their shared finances, appealing not only to married partners but also to those in committed relationships or simply dating.\n\n**The Problem**  \nTraditionally, joint bank accounts in India have been mired in bureaucracy, available only to married couples and requiring cumbersome procedures and limited features. In contrast, modern relationships demand flexibility and ease, with couples often sharing expenses long before tying the knot.

Couples can easily set up their accounts, invite partners, and start spending together. The experience is designed specifically for today‚Äôs needs, combining financial management with relationship dynamics, thus creating a platform where love and finances meet harmoniously.\n\n**Rewards and Benefits**  \nFurther enhancing the appeal, Coupl rewards users with perks for spending together.
