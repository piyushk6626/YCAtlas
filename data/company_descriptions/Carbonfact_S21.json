We consolidate and clean your diverse data sets, from **any** source, in **any** format. To reduce your workload to a minimum, we build a custom connector that integrates with your existing systems, automating future data import and creating a live connection to Carbonfact.\\n![1 Retrieve your data_11zon](https://www.carbonfact.com/hubfs/1%20Retrieve%20your%20data_11zon.webp)\\n02 Fill data gaps\\nIncomplete data? Not a problem - we identify and fill in your data gaps. Data engineering features and AI - trained on extensive primary data sets - automatically fill in missing details like component weights, dtex, and process-level steps. \\n![Fill data gaps](https://www.carbonfact.com/hubfs/Fill%20data%20gaps.png)\\n03 Calculate footprints\\nOnce your data is processed, our Life Cycle Assessment engine automatically calculates the footprints for each of your products on an SKU level. The numbers update whenever new purchase orders are synced via the live data connection. \\n![3 Calculate footprints](https://www.carbonfact.com/hubfs/3%20Calculate%20footprints.png)\\n04 Improve data quality\\nCarbonfact helps you identify emission hotspots and smartly prioritize your supplier data collection.

Traditionally LCAs have been complex and labor-intensive to compile, but by integrating Carbonfact\\'s automated and industry-specific Life Cycle Assessment with our ERP and PLM systems, we get precise, real-time input of product data which makes it easier to meet regulatory demands as well as see how different material choices affect the overall carbon footprint of our collections, so we can make better decisions every day.”\\n![Hultafors-Snickers_Maria-Schartau_490⟨70⟩]\\n##### Maria Schartau\\nSustainability Manager at Snickers Workwear & Solid Gear\\n ⟨71⟩\\n![allbirds⟨72⟩]\\n\"Allbirds was founded to create better things in a better way, a mission that inspired our laser-focus on carbon reduction -- and eventually, labeling each of our products with its carbon footprint. As we continue to grow, Carbonfact\\'s offerings, particularly its product-level focus for footwear and apparel, ensures we can both measure our carbon footprint and actively find ways to reduce it. Carbonfact has been instrumental in helping us model different scenarios and make informed decisions that align with our sustainability goals.\"\\n![Aileen Lerch_11zon⟨73⟩]\\n##### **Aileen Lerch**\\nSustainability at Allbirds \\n ⟨74⟩\\n![Fondof⟨75⟩]\\n\"With Carbonfact, we finally found a partner that ideally complements our new carbon strategy. The ability to break down carbon data down to product level finally gives us insight into the biggest levers for carbon reduction along the entire product life cycle. With the modelling function of possible scenarios, we hope to integrate carbon reduction measures into product development. This will be an important step towards achieving our carbon targets.\"\\n![1678285292904⟨76⟩]\\n##### **Philipp Schumacher**\\nCorporate Social Responsibility Manager at Fondof\\n ⟨77⟩\\n![ARMEDANGELS⟨78⟩]\\n\"Among the crowded market of carbon management tools, Carbonfact stood out for us. Their solution met our specific needs of automating carbon footprint calculations for all our products and emission scopes in the textile industry. Carbonfact\\'s LCA expertise, smart approach to handling data gaps, and ability to connect and feed calculation results back into our systems were key factors that convinced us.”\\n![Katya Kruk-1_11zon⟨79⟩]\\n##### Katya Kruk\\nImpact & Innovation Director at ARMEDANGELS\\n ⟨80⟩\\n![A.P.C.⟨81⟩].png?width=1684&height=440&name=pngegg%20\\\\(1\\\\).png)\\n“Our journey with Carbonfact began with the platform ingesting all of our existing product data. Carbonfact did all the heavy lifting in regards to cleaning and consolidating our data. Our manual workload was minimal, allowing us to focus on our decarbonization efforts. Their hands-on decarbonization workshops provided us with practical insights and guidance. Carbonfact is not just a Carbon Management Software, but an extension of our sustainability team.”\\n![1694497763173⟨82⟩]\\n##### Florence Degoy Vacher\\nSecrétaire Générale chez A.P.C.\\n ⟨83⟩\\n![HAPPYSOCKS-1⟨84⟩]\\n\"We have moved from spend-based carbon accounting into Carbonfact to prioritise primary data and get more accurate calculations. The main reason for us to choose Carbonfact is that we now not only get our company\\'s total carbon footprint but also break it down for each of our products. Thanks to Carbonfact’s focus on the apparel industry we get life cycle assessments with industry specific data for all our products in an easy way. Which helps us make the right decisions and reach our goal of reducing our emissions by 50% before 2030.”\\n![Malin Bosaeus⟨85⟩]\\n##### Malin Bosaeus\\nGlobal Sustainability Managerat Happy Socks\\n ⟨86⟩\\n![Cobalt⟨87⟩]\\nCobalt’s goal is to proactively manage our carbon footprint in the supply chain with the partners concerned and integrate such data into our ERP system.
