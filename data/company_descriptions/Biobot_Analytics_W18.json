  "description": "Biobot Analytics develops cutting-edge technology to transform sewers into public health observatories. Wastewater contains valuable information about the health of communities. We collect it. We analyze it. We tell you how to leverage it to make your city better.\r\n\nOur first product is to measure opioids and other drug metabolites in sewage to estimate consumption in cities. With this data, those working on harm reduction can assess the scope of the epidemic, allocate resources, and gauge the effectiveness of programming over time.",

  "generated_description": "### Biobot Analytics Overview\n\n**Company Name:** Biobot Analytics  \n**Founded:** 2018  \n**Location:** Cambridge, MA  \n**Batch:** Y Combinator W18  \n**Team Size:** 17 employees  \n**Group Partner:** Michael Seibel  \n\n**Website:** [biobot.io](http://biobot.io)\n\n#### Mission\nBiobot Analytics aims to harness the unseen potential of wastewater to improve population health. They have revolutionized the way we perceive sewage, transforming it into a powerful tool for public health observatories. Their data-driven insights aim to help cities enhance public wellbeing by analyzing the health information embedded in wastewater. \n\n#### What They Do\nBiobot develops advanced technology to analyze sewage for valuable health data. Their primary focus is measuring opioids and other drug metabolites in wastewater to estimate usage patterns in cities. This data enables organizations working on harm reduction to better understand the epidemic, allocate resources effectively, and monitor the impact of their programs over time. \n\nThe company has also expanded its offerings to include tracking respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 and flu in real-time nationwide. By analyzing wastewater, they provide early warnings about potential outbreaks and health threats, allowing healthcare systems to respond proactively.\n\n#### Key Products and Services\n1. **Wastewater-Based Epidemiology**: Biobot analyzes sewage to track and predict disease spread, enabling public health officials to allocate resources where they are needed most.\n2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Their system provides early warnings of viral activity, often weeks before hospital admissions reflect the increase in cases.\n3. **Opioid Usage Insights**: By measuring drug-related substances in sewage, they inform harm reduction strategies.\n\n#### The Biobot Advantage\n- **Inclusivity**: Wastewater data captures information from the entire community, regardless of individual healthcare access.\n- **Timeliness**: Their data can detect health trends days to weeks before traditional clinical data.\n- **Accuracy**: Their findings are validated against clinical data, ensuring reliability.\n\n#### Recognition\nBiobot Analytics was the first company to commercialize wastewater-based health tracking technology, rooted in MIT research. In 2021, they were selected by the U.S. government to establish the CDC National Wastewater Surveillance System, a groundbreaking initiative for comprehensive disease tracking.\n\n#### Future Direction\nAs they continue to innovate, Biobot Analytics aims to further establish wastewater as a crucial tool in public health research and response, offering cities greater insights and enabling proactive measures to enhance community health.\n\nIn short, if you’re looking to leverage the unseen data present in our daily lives—even in what we often consider waste—Biobot Analytics is leading the charge to turn that data into actionable insights for better health outcomes."
