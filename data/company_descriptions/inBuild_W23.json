  "generated_description": "**inBuild: Revolutionizing Construction Finance with AI-Enhanced Automation**\n\nFounded in 2021 and backed by Y Combinator's Batch W23, inBuild is reshaping the landscape of construction finance with a laser focus on workflow automation. Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, the company is a compact yet dynamic team of 12, led by Group Partner Brad Flora.\n\n### Mission\ninBuild’s mission is straightforward: automate the complexity of construction finance workflow. In an industry where managing invoices from multiple subcontractors can feel like herding cats, inBuild steps in to streamline the entire process. When a subcontractor submits an invoice, inBuild checks it against the budget, processes approvals, makes payments, and updates QuickBooks—all without the tedious manual entry.\n\n### Products & Features\nThe platform offers several key features designed to save time and enhance efficiency:\n- **Invoicing Inbox**: Manage all incoming invoices seamlessly.\n- **Accounts Payable Hub**: Centralize your financial operations.\n- **Project Budgeting**: Keep your budgets on track without the headaches.\n- **Instant Pay Applications**: Quick and customizable export of pay applications.\n- **Mobile App**: Upload and manage documents from anywhere.\n\ninBuild integrates smoothly with other platforms such as Procore, QuickBooks, DocuSign, and many more, making it easier to sync financial workflows.\n\n### Why Choose inBuild?\n**Time-Saving Automation**: Users report saving over 15 hours a month on pay applications alone. Such efficiency allows teams to focus on what truly matters—building.\n\n**User-Centric Design**: The software is crafted for modern builders, enabling project managers and financial controllers to manage documents from the field, ultimately simplifying interactions and enhancing productivity.\n\n### Testimonials\nThe feedback suggests that inBuild isn’t just making promises—it’s over-delivering on them. Users like Jake Walsh from JT Builders have significantly cut down their financial management time with inBuild, transforming what used to be a 16-hour task into less than 4 hours monthly, all while ensuring accuracy.\n\n### Support\nWith a support team based in the U.S., inBuild boasts a response time of under five minutes, providing technical assistance and updates in real-time, eliminating frustrating offshore support due to time zone differences.\n\n### The Takeaway\nIn a nutshell, inBuild is more than just a financial software—it’s evolving the construction finance industry through AI-enhanced automation. For builders looking to streamline finances and eliminate manual processes, inBuild is the tool that promises accuracy, efficiency, and a modern approach to old-fashioned problems.\n\nFor more information, you can visit their website at [inbuild.ai](https://www.inbuild.ai/)."
