  "description": "Blixo offers fast, scalable, and more accessible short-term (3 months) supply chain financing in Southeast Asia (SEA). Blixo specializes in providing smaller loans (<$50k) with an AI-driven underwriting process (approval in <1 week). These loans have higher repayment rates and lower per customer risk. Blixo uses AI credit scoring based on real-time data such as cash flow and inventory, further reducing risk and streamlining repayment. Unlike traditional banks and recent FinTech entrants, Blixo can profitably finance the 74% of suppliers and retailers in SEA that otherwise would be overlooked by traditional lenders because they either lack a traditional credit score or need a loan under $100k.",
