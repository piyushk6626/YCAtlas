Start with low code, deploy fast, and govern AI workflows with confidence.\\n## Deliver tomorrow\\'s roadmap today with Apollo\\nThe GraphOS platform enables backend teams to build a self-service, self-documenting graph that can power any number of applications. \\nDefine data once, deliver anywhere\\nEliminate accumulated technical debt from backends-for-frontends or experience APIs. GraphQL federation provides a secure source of truth for the data that powers your business.\\n##### Reduce boilerplate code.\\nBackend teams contribute to a unified and composable platform instead of building one-off backends-for-frontends or experience APIs.\\n##### Create consistent user experiences.\\nBy introducing composability, your teams only have to define core entities and business logic once. Then ship anywhere, across any interface.\\n### Deliver features faster\\nGraphQL enables teams to deliver feature improvements and experiments faster by decoupling the backend and the frontend. GraphOS provides teams with the tools they need to deliver these benefits at any scale.\\n##### Streamline collaboration across backend teams.\\nProvide a central registry and standardized workflows for backend teams to work better together.\\n##### Provide self-service for frontend teams.\\nApollo’s architecture enables frontend teams to fetch all of the data they need from a single endpoint, no matter where it is stored.\\n### Improve performance across applications\\nGraphQL reduces latency by enabling frontend teams to fetch all of the data they need from a single request. Optimize GraphQL\\'s performance gains even more with Apollo GraphOS.\\n##### Reduce latency across applications.\\nGraphQL reduces unnecessary network calls that slow your apps down. Take advantage of these benefits at a broader scale using GraphOS Router.\\n##### Diagnose issues quickly.\\nGraphOS provides GraphQL-native metrics to improve performance. Export these numbers into DataDog or OpenTelemetry for further analysis.\\n## Enterprise teams trust Apollo\\nEnterprises rely on Apollo to unify their APIs into a single, discoverable, and reusable platform that adapts to any use case. Product development teams can work independently, reuse APIs, and deliver new features lightning-fast while benefiting from modularity, optionality, and autonomy.\\n![Matt Sexton](http://apollographql.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F102461%2F1697568443-matt-sexton.jpeg&w=3840&q=75)\\nMatt Sexton\\nSolutions Architect at Booking.com\\n“We wanted to move from our monolithic architecture to a modern distributed architecture that allows us to deploy new features independently.

Start with low code, deploy fast, and govern AI workflows with confidence.\\n## Deliver tomorrow\\'s roadmap today with Apollo\\nThe GraphOS platform enables backend teams to build a self-service, self-documenting graph that can power any number of applications. \\nDefine data once, deliver anywhere\\nEliminate accumulated technical debt from backends-for-frontends or experience APIs. GraphQL federation provides a secure source of truth for the data that powers your business.\\n##### Reduce boilerplate code.\\nBackend teams contribute to a unified and composable platform instead of building one-off backends-for-frontends or experience APIs.\\n##### Create consistent user experiences.\\nBy introducing composability, your teams only have to define core entities and business logic once. Then ship anywhere, across any interface.\\n### Deliver features faster\\nGraphQL enables teams to deliver feature improvements and experiments faster by decoupling the backend and the frontend. GraphOS provides teams with the tools they need to deliver these benefits at any scale.\\n##### Streamline collaboration across backend teams.\\nProvide a central registry and standardized workflows for backend teams to work better together.\\n##### Provide self-service for frontend teams.\\nApollo’s architecture enables frontend teams to fetch all of the data they need from a single endpoint, no matter where it is stored.\\n### Improve performance across applications\\nGraphQL reduces latency by enabling frontend teams to fetch all of the data they need from a single request. Optimize GraphQL\\'s performance gains even more with Apollo GraphOS.\\n##### Reduce latency across applications.\\nGraphQL reduces unnecessary network calls that slow your apps down. Take advantage of these benefits at a broader scale using GraphOS Router.\\n##### Diagnose issues quickly.\\nGraphOS provides GraphQL-native metrics to improve performance. Export these numbers into DataDog or OpenTelemetry for further analysis.\\n## Enterprise teams trust Apollo\\nEnterprises rely on Apollo to unify their APIs into a single, discoverable, and reusable platform that adapts to any use case. Product development teams can work independently, reuse APIs, and deliver new features lightning-fast while benefiting from modularity, optionality, and autonomy.\\n![Matt Sexton⟨8⟩]\\nMatt Sexton\\nSolutions Architect at Booking.com\\n“We wanted to move from our monolithic architecture to a modern distributed architecture that allows us to deploy new features independently.

  "generated_description": "Let’s talk about Apollo, a company that's redefining how engineering teams accelerate their delivery through the power of GraphQL. Initially launched as Apollo GraphQL, they've quickly become a key player in both open-source and commercial GraphQL technologies. With a robust combination of tools—the Apollo Client, Server, and Gateway—their technology is downloaded over 17 million times a month, and it's trusted by a whopping 30% of the Fortune 500 companies including giants like Walmart and PayPal.\n\nFounded in 2012 and backed by a powerhouse cast of investors like Insight Partners, Y Combinator, and Andreessen Horowitz, Apollo is headquartered in San Francisco and currently boasts a dynamic team of 200 employees. They're not just another tech tool; they're a partner in the development process, assisting teams in building and scaling their APIs efficiently.\n\nTheir suite of products focuses on three foundational pillars:\n\n1. **Faster Development**: The Apollo GraphOS platform allows backend teams to create a self-service, self-documenting graph. This architecture reduces boilerplate code and allows teams to deliver updates faster. In practical terms, it means that once a developer defines data semantics, it can deliver across various applications seamlessly.\n\n2. **Improved Collaboration**: Apollo fosters better collaboration among backend teams by providing a centralized registry and standardized workflows. This means less friction when teams need to work together, helping developers to focus on what truly matters—building features!\n\n3. **Performance Optimization**: By reducing unnecessary latency and allowing frontend teams to fetch all required data in a single request, Apollo helps in optimizing the performance of applications. They even offer GraphQL-native metrics through GraphOS for quick diagnosis of any performance issues.\n\nTheir customers' feedback speaks volumes. Leaders from Booking.com, Netflix, and many more have testified to the transformational impact Apollo’s solutions have had on their engineering processes. For instance, Rick Fast from Expedia praised their unified approach, stating that it allowed them to rebuild their entire trips experience three times faster than their previous methods.\n\nIn a nutshell, Apollo is on a mission to make GraphQL the centerpiece of modern engineering practices. If you're looking for robust tooling for faster development, improved collaboration, and enhanced performance, they're worth your attention. You can learn more about Apollo and explore their offerings at [Apollo GraphQL](http://apollographql.com)."
