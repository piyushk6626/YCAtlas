  "generated_description": "**VenoStent: Innovating Vascular Health**\n\nVenoStent, founded in 2017, is on a mission to tackle a critical problem in vascular surgeries. Every year, there are around 10 million dialysis and bypass operations globally, but up to 50% of these procedures fail. This startling statistic reveals the necessity for better support during such critical operations. Enter VenoStent's flagship product: the SelfWrap, a bioabsorbable vascular wrap designed to substantially reduce the failure rates of dialysis access points.\n\nBased in Houston, Texas, VenoStent has a compact but effective team of 17 talented individuals. Their expertise spans biomedical and materials engineering, as well as medical 3D printing, which is central to their innovative technological approach.\n\n### The Technology: SelfWrap\n\nThe SelfWrap is a flexible and bioabsorbable device specifically created to enhance the success rates of dialysis access sites. For patients with end-stage renal disease, these access points are not just clinical necessities; they're crucial lifelines. However, the reality is stark: 50-60% of these sites fail within the first year of use. In the U.S. alone, this translates into over 480,000 patients relying on hemodialysis and an eye-watering $4 billion in Medicare costs due to access site failures.\n\nVenoStent aims to change this narrative by pioneering a novel tissue engineering technique, focusing initially on renal dialysis access. Their efforts haven't gone unnoticed; the SelfWrap recently received FDA's Breakthrough Device Designation, enabling expedited development and review processes for innovative technologies that could significantly improve patient outcomes.\n\n### Recent Developments\n\nVenoStent is making strides in its clinical research, having recently enrolled subjects for a pivotal clinical trial. They completed a $16 million Series A financing round, marking a significant milestone in their growth journey.\n\n### The Team and Vision\n\nGuided by the expertise of Jared Friedman, their Group Partner at Y Combinator, VenoStent embodies a forward-thinking attitude. Positioned as an innovative force within the medical device field, they aim not just to introduce a new product but to transform how vascular surgeries are approached, especially in the context of dialysis.\n\nIf you're curious to learn more about how VenoStent is attempting to save lives one wrap at a time, check out their website: [VenoStent](https://www.venostent.com).\n\n---\n\nIn summary, VenoStent isn’t just another medical device company; they're at the forefront of addressing a significant healthcare challenge with cutting-edge technology, dedicated resources, and a clear vision for improving patient outcomes in vascular surgeries."
