  "description": "Humans make billions of calls/day. We think a majority of these will be handled by AI built by thousands of companies tackling every single vertical.\r\n\nMaking these AI voice agents reliable is hard. A small change in prompts, function call definitions, or model providers can cause large changes in LLM outputs. \r\n\nHamming automates testing for AI voice agents. Our voice agents call your voice agent. An AI drive-through startup uses Hamming to simulate thousands of simultaneous phone calls to achieve 99.99% agent order accuracy.\r\n\nWe have a proven track record of helping enterprises win with AI. Sumanyu (CEO) previously helped Citizen (safety app) grow its users by 4X and grew an AI-powered sales program to 100s of millions in revenue/year at Tesla. Marius (CTO) previously ran data infrastructure @ Anduril and was a founding engineer @ Spell (MLOps startup acquired by Reddit).",

Measure improvements in accuracy, latency, and call completion.\\n### Score Override\\nOverride AI conversation scores to align with your quality standards. Each override helps train the AI judge to better evaluate voice interactions.\\n### Production Call Analytics\\nSearch and analyze voice conversations to understand why your AI agent responded in a particular way. Identify patterns in successful and failed interactions.\\n### Sampling\\nRun multiple tests of the same scenario to understand performance variations. Identify and fix flaky interactions before they reach users.\\n### Team Collaboration\\nShare voice datasets, test results, and conversation traces with your team. Collaborate to improve voice agent performance across all scenarios.\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n### FAQs\\n## What is AI voice agent testing? Why do I need it?\\nCurrent voice agents are notoriously hard to test. Teams currently spend hours testing these agents on a limited number of test cases.\\nWe spin up 1000s of parallel test calls to your voice agent and give you detailed reports on where your agent is struggling. This is more scalable, systematic and rigorous than human vibe checks - where a human manually goes through a set of questions to assess quality.\\nOur AI based voice agent testing is 1000x faster and 20x cheaper than using humans.\\n## Are you HIPAA compliant?\\nHamming is HIPAA compliant.\\n## Do you just test the voice piece or the conversational LLM flow as well?\\nWe test both voice and conversational aspects of your system.\\nFor voice, we test your system's ability to handle long pauses, interruptions and background noises.\\nFor conversational flows, we test your system's ability to handle complex conversations and an array of personas.\\n## What metrics do you use measure voice and conversational quality? Can I define my own metrics?\\nWe routinely build bespoke metrics for customers in unique domains.\\nYou can also define your own metrics and use them for both testing your voice agents in dev and prod.\\n## How does Hamming integrate with existing LLM frameworks or voice infrastructure?\\nSee our [Python SDK](https://hamming.ai/<https:/pypi.org/project/hamming-sdk/>) and [Typescript SDK](https://hamming.ai/<https:/www.npmjs.com/package/@hamming/hamming-sdk>).

Why do I need it?\\nCurrent voice agents are notoriously hard to test. Teams currently spend hours testing these agents on a limited number of test cases.\\nWe spin up 1000s of parallel test calls to your voice agent and give you detailed reports on where your agent is struggling. This is more scalable, systematic and rigorous than human vibe checks - where a human manually goes through a set of questions to assess quality.\\nOur AI based voice agent testing is 1000x faster and 20x cheaper than using humans.\\n## Are you HIPAA compliant?\\nHamming is HIPAA compliant.\\n## Do you just test the voice piece or the conversational LLM flow as well?\\nWe test both voice and conversational aspects of your system.\\nFor voice, we test your system's ability to handle long pauses, interruptions and background noises.\\nFor conversational flows, we test your system's ability to handle complex conversations and an array of personas.\\n## What metrics do you use measure voice and conversational quality? Can I define my own metrics?\\nWe routinely build bespoke metrics for customers in unique domains.\\nYou can also define your own metrics and use them for both testing your voice agents in dev and prod.\\n## How does Hamming integrate with existing LLM frameworks or voice infrastructure?\\nSee our Python SDK⟨47⟩ and Typescript SDK⟨48⟩. Integration is ~30 lines of code.\\nWe're agnostic to any framework, LLMs, or voice infrastructure.\\n## Who is Hamming for?\\nOur platform is built for teams. We help folks from engineering, product and domain experts to collaborate and build reliable AI voice agents quickly.\\nWe're experts in supporting companies tackling high-stakes domains where getting the wrong answer leads to high churn or regulatory consequences.\\nOur customers use Hamming to build retentive AI products in their industry.\\n## Can I self-host Hamming?\\nWe offer on-premise deployment for enterprises who want greater control over security and data handling.

  "generated_description": "**Hamming AI: Revolutionizing Automated Voice Agent Testing**\n\n**Overview**: Founded in 2024 as part of Y Combinator’s Batch S24, Hamming AI is on a mission to make AI voice agents reliable through automated testing. The company was born out of the observation that humans make billions of calls daily, and as AI technology matures, a majority of these calls will eventually be handled by AI systems built by countless companies across various sectors.\n\n**The Challenge**: Ensuring the reliability of AI voice agents is no small feat. Even minor adjustments in prompts or configurations can significantly affect the performance of large language models (LLMs), leading to variability in outputs. Hamming AI addresses this challenge by simulating call scenarios directly between voice agents, providing an essential layer of testing and validation.\n\n**What They Do**: Hamming automates the process of testing AI voice agents, allowing users to simulate thousands of concurrent phone calls in mere minutes. For instance, their collaboration with an AI drive-through startup has led to achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 99.99% in order fulfillment through rigorous testing.\n\n**Leadership Team**: The brains behind Hamming AI are Sumanyu, the CEO, and Marius, the CTO. Sumanyu has a proven track record, having previously helped Citizen grow its user base significantly and generating hundreds of millions in revenue through an AI-driven sales program at Tesla. Marius brings deep technical expertise from his previous roles at Anduril and as a founding engineer at Spell, a prominent MLOps startup acquired by Reddit.\n\n**Funding and Partnerships**: Hamming AI has successfully raised $3.8 million in seed funding aimed at improving the reliability of AI voice interactions. They're backed by a raft of reputable investors and are already helping enterprises navigate the complexities of AI deployment.\n\n**Product Offerings**:\n1. **Automated AI Voice Agent Testing**: Hamming's platform empowers teams to run thousands of parallel calls to their AI agents, dramatically speeding up the testing process and enhancing accuracy.\n  \n2. **Prompt Management**: Businesses can efficiently manage and sync diverse prompts tailored for different users and use cases.\n\n3. **Prompt Optimizer & Playground**: The platform offers tools for generating optimized prompts and testing LLM outputs to enhance usability and performance.\n\n4. **Production Call Analytics**: Beyond mere testing, Hamming provides analytic tools to assess how voice agents perform in real-world scenarios, enabling proactive issue resolution.\n\n5. **Multi-Scenario Testing**: Hamming can simulate varied high-stakes environments—be it restaurant orders, healthcare follow-ups, or customer service—all while adhering to regulatory standards like HIPAA.\n\n**Customer Success**: Hamming AI is trusted by enterprises in critical sectors. Clients have lauded the service for its effectiveness in enhancing order accuracy, managing operational risks, and rolling out AI-driven updates confidently.\n\n**Conclusion**: By streamlining the testing of AI voice agents, Hamming AI stands poised to become an indispensable ally for companies venturing into AI-driven communication. The future of voice technology is here, and it's automated. Check out more about Hamming at [hamming.ai](https://hamming.ai)."
