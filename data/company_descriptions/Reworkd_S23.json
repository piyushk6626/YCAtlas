Customers come to us with lists of 100s to 1000s of websites along with a data schema. Our agents traverse these websites, understand their structure, and generate code to extract data from them.\r\n\nWe've been working on LLM agents since their inception and have received over 30k stars on GitHub and 1M+ users across previous agent products.

  "generated_description": "**Reworkd: Simplifying Web Data Extraction**\n\nFounded in 2023 and hailing from the bustling tech hub of San Francisco, Reworkd is on a mission to make web data extraction as seamless as possible. Their driving principle is straightforward: customers should be able to extract data from hundreds or thousands of websites without fuss or code. This is done through the magic of multimodal LLM agents—intelligent tools that navigate the complexities of web pages and generate the necessary code to retrieve valuable information.\n\nWith over 30,000 stars on GitHub and more than 1 million users utilizing their various agent products, Reworkd is not just another startup; it's already making waves in the generative AI and B2B space. Their approach to web data scraping sidesteps the usual headaches associated with data collection, such as handling dynamic content, maintaining extraction scripts, or dealing with rate limits.
