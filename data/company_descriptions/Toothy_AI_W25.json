We're building a reality where a dental clinic only needs 3 types of employees: dentists, hygienists, and dental assistants. Every other role is to be done by AI. \r\n\nAt our first clinic we've already managed to cut back office staff in half in the two months we've been operating with them. We charge 40% of what overseas BPOs do for the equivalent labor, and a fraction of what in-house employees cost.",

  "generated_description": "### Toothy AI: Revolutionizing Dental Back-Office Operations\n\nFounded in 2024 and hailing from San Francisco, Toothy AI is making waves in the dental industry by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to automate back-office operations for dental clinics. Part of Y Combinator's Batch W25, this scrappy startup is a team of just seven, yet they've already showcased significant results with their innovative approach.\n\n#### Mission\n\nToothy AI's mission is simple and ambitious: reduce the administrative workload in dental practices so that clinics ultimately only need dentists, hygienists, and dental assistants. All other roles can be handled by AI. By streamlining operations, they’re not just making dental clinics more efficient—they’re transforming how these practices communicate with technology.\n\n#### The Problem They Solve\n\nBack-office operations, like insurance verifications, claims filing, and account follow-ups, often bog down dental practices, consuming valuable time and resources. Toothy AI's solution allows dental clinics to cut their back-office staff by 50%—and they have the results to prove it. In a pilot clinic, they managed that feat in just two months.\n\n#### Cost Efficiency\n\nToothy AI operates on a pricing model that's appealingly competitive, charging only 40% of what overseas business process outsourcing services would demand, and significantly less than the costs of in-house employees. This not only helps clinics save money but also accelerates cash flow, with 99% of account receivables collected in under 30 days.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nToothy AI integrates seamlessly with existing practice management software.
