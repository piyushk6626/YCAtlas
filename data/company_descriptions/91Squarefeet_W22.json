  "description": "91Squarefeet is solving the coordination problem in interior projects. These projects require high-frequency coordination over a small time window, and we have found a neat solution. \r\n\nOur tech, Rdash.io, onboarded 150 organizations in its first 12 months. ICICI Bank, Shopper Stop, and Simpliwork use it for project tracking, subcontracting, and procurement. Monthly, $15Mn projects are created and $5Mn procurement happens on Rdash. Companies that are using Rdash typically save 10% in their fit-out expenditure. \r\n\nOn the back of this tech, we have scaled our business of building offices and retail shops to $10Mn Annualised Revenue. We have built 1100+ offices and retail shops for MongoDB, HSBC, Calvin Klein, and 60 other customers.",

  "generated_description": "### 91Squarefeet: Transforming Spaces through Technology and Innovation\n\n**Company Overview**\nFounded in 2021 and based in Gurugram, India, 91Squarefeet specializes in providing software solutions and services aimed at streamlining office and retail shop construction processes. The firm emerged from the recognition of a pressing issue: the intricate coordination required for interior projects, which demand rapid communication and oversight.\n\n**Tech Edge: Rdash.io**\nCentral to their success is **Rdash.io**, a cutting-edge platform for project tracking, procurement, and subcontracting. In just its first year, Rdash onboarded 150 organizations, including prominent names like **ICICI Bank** and **Shopper Stop**. With approximately $15 million in projects created and $5 million in procurement managed monthly, users of Rdash typically enjoy a remarkable 10% savings on their fit-out expenditures.\n\n**Business Scale and Achievements**\nLeveraging this technology, 91Squarefeet has scaled rapidly, achieving an annualized revenue of $10 million and successfully delivering over **1,100 projects** for diverse clients such as **MongoDB, HSBC,** and **Calvin Klein**. The differentiation lies in their direct approach—91Squarefeet keeps the entire fit-out process in-house, eschewing subcontractors in favor of investing heavily in workforce training and direct procurement from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).\n\n**Mission and Core Services**\nThe mission of 91Squarefeet revolves around **“Software and Service to build offices and Retail Shops.”** Their offerings include:\n\n1. **Office Fitouts**: Ensuring high-quality fit-outs with efficient turnaround times.\n2. **Turnkey Retail Fitouts**: An all-in-one solution that guarantees speedy project completion.\n3. **Retail Identity Design**: Creating shopping experiences that align with consumer behaviors and aesthetics.\n4. **Project Financing**: Providing financial services related to fit-out projects.\n\nAs seen on their website, they claim impressive metrics:\n- **500+ projects delivered**\n- **100+ cities covered**\n- A commendable **zero percent on-time delivery failure rate.**\n\n**The Team and Leadership**\n91Squarefeet boasts a dynamic team of **180 employees**, complemented by the mentorship of Michael Seibel as their Group Partner through Y Combinator's Batch W22. \n\n**Looking Ahead**\nWith a commitment to technological innovation and workforce empowerment, 91Squarefeet is poised for continued growth. They are actively hiring 500 Project Management Specialists and 100 architects by the end of 2025, reinforcing their mission to simplify commercial fit-outs in India.\n\nFor more information about their projects or to get in touch, check out their [website](https://www.91squarefeet.com/).\n\nIn summary, 91Squarefeet is not just building physical spaces; they are reshaping the landscape of how commercial projects are conceived, managed, and executed—one square foot at a time. This approach makes them a compelling case study in blending technology with traditional industries."
