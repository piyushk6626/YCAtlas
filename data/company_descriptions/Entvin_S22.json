  "generated_description": "**Entvin: Pioneering AI in Life Sciences**\n\nFounded in 2022 by a team of IIT Bombay graduates, Entvin is on a mission to revolutionize the way life sciences companies—particularly those in pharmaceuticals and biotech—utilize artificial intelligence. Imagine being able to harness the power of large language models (LLMs) like Llama, Gemini, GPT-4, and Claude, but without compromising your sensitive data. That’s what Entvin offers: a custom, secure platform that allows enterprises to deploy AI directly on their infrastructure.\n\nThe startup is rooted in a strong commitment to accelerating research and streamlining the process of bringing new drugs to market. By enhancing workflows in R&D, clinical trials, and regulatory teams, Entvin ensures that companies can leverage cutting-edge AI technology while maintaining strict data privacy and compliance. This eliminates the inconvenient and potentially risky practice of outsourcing sensitive data to external servers.\n\nLocated in Bengaluru, India, with a lean team of three employees, Entvin has already made its mark by becoming part of Y Combinator's Batch S22—an indication of its innovative approach and potential for growth. With Harj Taggar as their Group Partner, they’re well-positioned within the Y Combinator ecosystem to scale their impact.\n\nIn summary, Entvin blends state-of-the-art technology with a deep understanding of the healthcare landscape, tagged as a player in the SaaS, health-tech, B2B, and healthcare IT sectors. Their goal? To empower companies in the life sciences domain to tap into AI, drive their research forward, and ultimately deliver better health outcomes—all while keeping data safety and control front and center.\n\nFor more information, you can visit their website at [entvin.com](http://entvin.com?utm_source=yc)."
