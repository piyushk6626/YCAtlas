  "description": "At Undermind, we're building a search engine that can handle extremely complex questions. It’s geared at experts, like research scientists and doctors, who need to find very specific resources to solve high-stakes problems. \r\n\nWe’ve rebuilt search from the ground up to address this. Our new approach employs high-quality LLMs to adaptively explore a database, mimicking how a human researcher carefully discovers information. This approach dramatically outperforms (by 10-50x) traditional keyword search and other modern AI-based retrieval methods.\r\n\nOur first target users are the 50 million researchers searching for scientific literature on PubMed and Google Scholar every month. We’ve have users paying us $200-$500 per seat per year, from fields like medicine, ML, biotech, finance, and more.",

During those few minutes, it’s scanning through hundreds of papers, cross comparing and ranking sources, and adapting its strategy as it learns about your topic. \\nDo you search full texts, or just abstracts?\\nUndermind Free Tier searches abstracts and metadata. In addition, for users who upgrade to our Pro tier, we provide more compute to also search the full texts of nearly all open access and preprint articles. \\nWhat makes Undermind different?\\nEvery other \"search engine\" you\\'ve used before just returns approximate recommendations, not precisely relevant results. As researchers ourselves, we know what you need is often so complex that you have to wade through hundreds of results. It\\'s painful. You should think of Undermind as sending a talented colleague to do a few days of research for you, working hard to find exactly what you need. \\nIt didn\\'t find my paper. Why?\\nIf you\\'re looking for a very specific paper, there\\'s a small chance it isn\\'t present in the [Semantic Scholar](https://www.undermind.ai/<https:/www.semanticscholar.org/>) database of over 200 million articles which we draw from. Another possibility is that the Undermind search has not yet converged. Unlike in a traditional search engine, where all results are returned at once, ordered from best to worst, we perform a search in stages, like you would as you carefully search the literature. We look at a the most promising set of papers first, and depending on the difficulty of finding relevant results within these papers, we may not discover all the relevant papers in this first pass. By statistically modeling this process, we can determine what fraction of relevant papers we have likely found. If your paper didn\\'t show up at first, it\\'s likely the search system knows it has not yet found everything (and the report summary will tell you). You can deploy more computation (\"extend\" the search) to find the rest. See our [whitepaper](https://www.undermind.ai/</static/Undermind_whitepaper.pdf>) for additional explanation. \\nWhy the name \"Undermind\"?\\nUndermind represents the **intelligence that supports and underpins your work**. Like the roots of a tree, it provides a **deep, rich foundation of knowledge** , helping you uncover insights that fuel discovery. \\n## Built by Researchers, for Researchers\\nUndermind was founded by **two MIT PhDs in quantum physics** , bringing decades of experience in **deep research, AI, and scientific discovery**. We’ve lived the struggle of sifting through endless papers—so we built Undermind to revolutionize the way researchers find knowledge. \\n![shape](https://www.undermind.ai/static/homepage/josh_headshot.jpeg)\\n##### Josh Ramette\\n###### CEO\\n  * [ ](https://www.undermind.ai/<https:/twitter.com/RametteJoshua>)\\n  * [ ](https://www.undermind.ai/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-ramette-50984791/>)\\n\\n\\n![shape](https://www.undermind.ai/static/homepage/tom_headshot.jpeg)\\n##### Tom Hartke\\n###### CTO\\n  * [ ](https://www.undermind.ai/<https:/twitter.com/tom_hartke>)\\n  * [ ](https://www.undermind.ai/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hartke-229a0679/>)\\n\\n\\n[Try Undermind now](https://www.undermind.ai/</accounts/signup/>)\\n##### Undermind: Deep scientific search\\n  * [Terms of use](https://www.undermind.ai/</terms_of_use/>)\\n  * |\\n  * [Privacy policy](https://www.undermind.ai/</privacy_policy/>)\\n  * |\\n  * © 2025 Undermind\\n\\n\\n[ Twitter ](https://www.undermind.ai/<https:/twitter.com/UndermindAI>) [ LinkedIn ](https://www.undermind.ai/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/undermind-ai>)\\nContact us\\n' markdown_with_citations=' ![Logo⟨1⟩ Undermind ](https://www.undermind.ai/</home/>)\\n  * Home⟨2⟩\\n  * Search⟨3⟩\\n  * Pricing⟨4⟩\\n  * Sign In⟨5⟩\\n  * Sign Up⟨6⟩\\n\\n\\n#  Radically better research, radically faster \\nOur AI assistant carefully reads hundreds of academic papers for you, finding exactly what you need, no matter how complex. \\n  * Try searching free⟨6⟩\\n  * Learn more ⟨7⟩\\n\\n\\n###### Trusted and Used by Researchers at\\n![MIT Logo⟨8⟩]\\n![Harvard Logo⟨9⟩]\\n![Caltech Logo⟨10⟩]\\n![Princeton Logo⟨11⟩]\\n![Berkeley Logo⟨12⟩]\\n![Cambridge Logo⟨13⟩]\\n## An Intelligent Assistant\\nImagine having a research assistant who works tirelessly for you.
