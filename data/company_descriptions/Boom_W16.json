  "generated_description": "Boom Supersonic is on a mission to revolutionize air travel with economically and environmentally sustainable supersonic jet technology. Founded in 2014 and hailing from Centennial, Colorado, Boom is building Overture, the world's fastest airliner. What sets Overture apart? It's designed to fly at twice the speed of current commercial planes while operating on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). \n\nThe propulsion system powering Overture, known as Symphony™, is a collaborative effort with industry leaders and is tailored specifically for supersonic travel. Currently, the company boasts an impressive order book of 130 aircraft from major airlines like American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines. Beyond civil markets, Boom is also collaborating with Northrop Grumman for defense applications of Overture, showcasing its versatility and demand across various sectors.\n\nWith a robust team of about 227 individuals drawn from premier aerospace organizations such as SpaceX, Boeing, and NASA, Boom is seeking top talent in engineering, design, and business to help realize its ambitious vision. The company has established strategic partnerships with entities like Collins Aerospace and Safran, among others, to bring Overture to market.\n\nBoom is also making strides beyond aircraft; they’re constructing the first American supersonic airliner factory, known as the Superfactory, in Greensboro, North Carolina. This facility will be central to Boom's mission to create a sustainable and efficient manufacturing process for supersonic aircraft.\n\nIn summary, Boom isn't just dreaming about the future of air travel—they're actively building it. They're focused not only on speed but also on sustainability, aiming to return supersonic travel to the mainstream while respecting our environmental responsibilities. If you're intrigued by the cutting-edge developments in transportation and aerospace, check out Boom Supersonic's website for the latest updates and opportunities."
