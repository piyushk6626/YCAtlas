  "generated_description": "Authzed is a burgeoning company based in New York, founded in 2020 by a trio of software entrepreneurs—Jake Moshenko, Joey Hurst, and Jimmy Zelinskie—who collectively bring a wealth of experience from their time at Red Hat and Google. They initially set out with a mission to empower businesses with robust, scalable authorization tools for their applications, drawing inspiration from Google’s Zanzibar model.\n\nThe heart of Authzed's offering is **SpiceDB**, an open-source permissions database designed to provide fine-grained access control. It's built for consistency and performance, making it suitable for companies looking to implement complex authorization systems without the usual headaches. By drawing from the Zanzibar principles, SpiceDB facilitates an advanced approach to managing user permissions—allowing teams to define access controls that can adapt to their specific needs while ensuring robust security.\n\nAuthzed's business model features various products: from managed services like **AuthZed Dedicated** and **AuthZed Serverless** to self-hosted and enterprise solutions. They cater to a diverse client base, ranging from startups to well-established corporations, all of whom rely on them to streamline their permission management processes.\n\nAs part of Y Combinator's W21 batch, Authzed has grown to a team of 24 and is under the guidance of Dalton Caldwell as their Group Partner. They are well-positioned in the developer tools and security space, sitting at the intersection of open-source innovation and enterprise needs. \n\nCurrently, they seem to be ramping up their outreach and community engagement efforts, promoting their products through various resources like documentation, a community Discord, and customer stories, while emphasizing their commitment to collaboration and learning.\n\nAuthzed is one of those companies that recognizes the growing complexities in application security and strives to simplify them without compromising on performance—essential for both developers and end-users. If you want to learn more about them, their platform, or give SpiceDB a try, their website is the best place to start: [authzed.com](https://authzed.com)."
