  "description": "RentHop (www.renthop.com) helps renters find great apartments.  We use sophisticated data analysis to rank apartment listings based on their \"freshness\"​, their accuracy and completeness and the responsiveness of the manager who listed the apartment on our site.  \r\n\nAs a renter, you can use list-based or map-based search tools to browse listings and comprehensive search filters to narrow our 100,000+ listings to just the ones you want.  It’s easy and fast to reach out to brokers and property managers to schedule viewings and to manage responses.\r\n\nYou can also use our innovative \"Appointments on Demand\"​ feature, a map showing the real-time locations of brokers and property managers available to show apartments, to reach out and schedule viewings on the fly! \r\n\nFor brokers and property managers, RentHop provides a cost-effective, easy-to-use tool to promote your listings, get qualified leads and schedule viewings.  You can also post and repost listings on the go using RentHop Manager, our mobile app for brokers and property managers, currently available in the iOS App Store.  (You can download the mobile app at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/renthop-manager/id695651355.)\r\n\nYour commitment to give good service will make you stand out on RentHop - our algorithm will credit you for your responsiveness and help give your listings the boost they need to get seen - and rented - by qualified renters.\r\n\nLook for our mobile app for consumers, due out soon!\r\n\nAnd please let us know any questions, thoughts or comments you may have - we'll look forward to hearing from you!  You can reach us at feedback@renthop.com.  You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter (@RentHop), Google+ and Pinterest.",

  "generated_description": "**RentHop: Smart Apartment Search Made Simple**\n\nFounded in New York and emerging from Y Combinator's Batch S09, RentHop is a comprehensive apartment rental marketplace that puts renters first. With a robust team of 9, RentHop leverages sophisticated data analysis to help tenants swiftly find their next home — and it's not just about browsing listings; it's about enhancing the entire renting experience.\n\n**Mission and Features:**\nRentHop’s mission is straightforward: to make the apartment hunting process efficient and user-friendly. It has developed a powerful ranking system that assesses listings based on \"freshness,\" accuracy, completeness, and the responsiveness of property managers. \n\nFor renters, the platform offers intuitive list- and map-based search tools, allowing users to filter through over 100,000 apartment listings. Whether you’re searching for a studio in Manhattan or a pet-friendly apartment in Brooklyn, RentHop has you covered. Its innovative \"Appointments on Demand\" feature makes it even easier to schedule viewings with brokers and property managers in real time.\n\n**For Property Managers:**\nOn the flip side, RentHop doesn’t just serve renters—it’s also a valuable tool for brokers and property managers. Its RentHop Manager app allows them to easily promote their listings, attract qualified leads, and manage responses directly from their mobile devices. The platform's algorithm rewards property managers with responsive service, boosting their listings visibility.\n\n**What’s Next:**\nLooking ahead, RentHop is set to launch its consumer mobile app, expanding its accessibility. The company also runs a Pro Referral Program, which incentivizes users to refer new agents, making it a win-win for all parties involved.\n\n**Engagement and Community:**\nRentHop encourages feedback and community interaction.
