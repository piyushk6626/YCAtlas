The company aims to be the \"Amazon for construction,\" providing an interactive shopping experience that empowers contractors and consumers alike.\n\nBolster operates as a marketplace connecting general contractors, subcontractors, retailers, and homeowners. With a robust database of over 114,000 real construction items at its disposal, Bolster streamlines the project management process from estimates to payments. This unique approach helps contractors create accurate estimates in minutes and enhances their competitive edge by enabling more effective presentations and upselling opportunities.\n\n### Key Features and Services:\n1. **Fast and Accurate Estimates**: Contractors can generate estimates leveraging a wealth of real construction data efficiently.\n2. **Interactive Presentations**: The platform allows users to present interactive proposals that inform clients and facilitate self-selection of finishes and upgrades.\n3. **Project Management Tools**: Scheduling and budget management become automated through the estimating process.
