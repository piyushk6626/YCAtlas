  "description": "Recurrency is reversing enterprise resource planning (ERP) stagnation by building the industry-standard ERP automation platform: blazingly fast and complete with powerful automation tools like intelligent sales recommendations, dynamic pricing, and demand forecasting. Despite distribution being a multi-trillion dollar industry, the legacy ERP systems that exist to help businesses manage their purchasing, inventory, sales, order processing, and accounting are decades behind. \r\n\nFor the most part, ERP systems are painfully slow, difficult to use, and soul-crushingly manual. Using Recurrency can boost a distributor’s revenue and profit margins, while reducing waste and saving time. Most importantly, Recurrency is fully integrated with the customer’s legacy system, so deploying Recurrency in production can be done in as little as one day.",
