And not just because when we bought it everything was perfect, but also because of how quick they were to iterate on the platform. \\nMario Guevara \\nAssistant Vice President of Advancement Services at NYU\\n## Our original idea was to use our phonathon network and just build a landing page for the campaign. But using GiveCampus added a sense of professionalism with the video, matches, challenges, and other features. It helped motivate people that weren\u2019t already familiar with the clinic to donate.\\nSanjay Jinka\\nPresident of Outreach at Northeast Ohio Medical University\\nGo to previous slide Go to next slide\\nGo to previous slide Go to next slide\\n![Security graphic depicting AICPA SOC logo, PCI-DSS logo, and AWS cloud.](https://go.givecampus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Security-Graphic.png)\\n## Enjoy 100% uptime\u2014all the time\\nYou work too hard to leave the last-mile of the donor experience to chance.
