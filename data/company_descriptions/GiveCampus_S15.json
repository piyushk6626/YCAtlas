My Partner Success Manager, Melanie, is amazing. Customer service is also on point! GiveCampus offers a great UX for our donors. We have gotten many compliments about the interface and ease of giving—especially with the digital wallet options and GC Connect.\\nSasha Christina R\\n### “Fantastic User Experience with GiveCampus”\\nI highly value their suite of fundraising products, and especially that the donor experience is consistent across their Social Fundraising and Giving Forms products. Donation forms are user-friendly and mobile friendly, and they are easy to set up and edit when necessary … The Volunteer Management system has provided the solution that we needed to reduce the amount of staff time required to coordinate peer-to-peer outreach, while providing access to classmate data that our volunteers want. \\nJulia H\\n### “The ease of integration with our database is part of what makes it so powerful”\\nGiveCampus makes it easy for me as a volunteer manager to work with over one hundred volunteers, and I’m in the system on nearly a daily basis. My volunteers love how easy GiveCampus is to use. They especially like the notifications they receive when someone in their group makes a donation … The features that GiveCampus offers are useful and the platform definitely makes donor engagement efficient and, at the same time, meaningful and personal. \\nDavonna A\\n### “I’m on GiveCampus every day!”\\nI inherited a contract with GiveCampus and wasn’t sure how to use the product and all the various functionalities. [The GiveCampus] team went above and beyond to make sure we got up to speed and helped us customize a great giving day social campaign. The support has also helped us learn to use all the modules we have access to—thanks for being so responsive, GC team! Once you learn the system, it is easy to use. I’m on GiveCampus every day!\\nHeather W\\n### “The tech is great, but the people make the difference.”\\nThe best part of GiveCampus has been the support. Among all the various vendors we have partnered with in my time as a fundraiser, the team at GiveCampus have always been the most ready to work beside us. Their product team is constantly striving to improve platforms, they offer key support on donor challenge days, and work to make implementation a breeze. The tech is great, but the people make the difference.\\nJoe K\\n### “… a much more pleasant experience for both donors and for financial staff”\\nResponsive people in every department; great customer service; extremely easy to use, both for staff and the donor. Quick to implement when we first started, and it’s been a great experience since … The switch to GC not only provided us with the ability to brand our giving forms the way that we wanted to, but also created a much more pleasant experience for both donors and for financial staff in terms of reporting. \\nColin D\\n### “GiveCampus is a Great Partner”\\nEvery time we’ve raised an issue, the support team has passed it along to the product development group and the team is great about implementing new features suggested by clients. GiveCampus is the best crowdfunding software we have ever had. It’s quick and easy to set up a campaign and really helps with our acquisition of new donors.\\nSamantha B\\n### “GiveCampus is exceptional!”\\nTheir tech support is so good and so fast, and they are also open to suggestions on how they can change and improve the platform. They take our feedback as users seriously and that means a lot … I love the new smart appeals that make it easy to remind current donors about their giving anniversary. The new AI features are also great. \\nAimee S\\n### “GiveCampus has been a perfect partner for over 5 years”\\nThe customer service is second to none. While building my giving day campaigns, I truly felt like my GiveCampus partner was working WITH me to make it a success, of which mine was theirs. GiveCampus has been a perfect partner for over 5 years now. GiveCampus allows me to coordinate online fundraising across an entire university’s worth of constituents and their fundraising needs.\\nJake D\\n### “Fundraising and engaging our constituents is made easier everyday”\\nThe platform is user friendly and intuitive for both back-end and front-end users. The customer service is bar none as reps. are always willing to listen, troubleshoot and share valuable insights. They take great care in ensuring all of their products and features are top-notch. GiveCampus is more than willing to work with and listen to their customers to make improvements and upgrades. Fundraising and engaging our constituents is made easier everyday because of GiveCampus. \\nAnonymous G2-Verified User\\n### “You can tell that they enjoy and are knowledgeable about what they do”\\nYour [PSM] helps you build strategies, looks over campaigns, and works with you so you get the most out of your GC products. Support responds quickly to questions or issues … There are regular webinars and GC updates designed for schools to delve deeper into GC products, build successful giving days, create a comprehensive marketing strategy for a campaign, and so much more. They even provide templates that you can use to create campaigns. They listen to your needs and ideas, constantly updating their products to give schools what they need.\\nAnonymous G2-Verified User\\n### “… reporting is easy and creates less headache on the back-end …”\\nFirst of all, the support team is amazing. I really like the ability to engage advocates and set up matches/challenges, as well as multiple campaign tiers. The reporting is easy and creates less headache on the back-end when we enter the gifts into our database. It’s also great that you can upload offline gifts that don’t eat into your subscription total. It’s the perfect solution to creating a community-wide day of giving with a platform that is easy, intuitive for users, and interactive.\\nLauren C\\n### “GiveCampus offers a great UX for our donors”\\nGiveCampus is very user friendly—for both the backend and the donor.

And not just because when we bought it everything was perfect, but also because of how quick they were to iterate on the platform. \\nMario Guevara \\nAssistant Vice President of Advancement Services at NYU\\n## Our original idea was to use our phonathon network and just build a landing page for the campaign. But using GiveCampus added a sense of professionalism with the video, matches, challenges, and other features.
