  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Farmtheory**\n\nFarmtheory is an innovative B2B agri-tech startup based in Bengaluru, India, founded in 2019. As part of the Y Combinator Batch W20, it stands out as India's first vegetable delivery service tailored specifically for restaurants—using a unique approach to address a critical issue in the agriculture supply chain. The company aims to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers of \"ugly produce,\" which refers to fresh fruits and vegetables that are cosmetically unappealing and often left unsold at farms.\n\n**Mission**  \nFarmtheory's mission is to create a seamless farm-to-fork value chain, ensuring that every piece of produce, regardless of its appearance, finds a place on restaurant tables. By doing so, they not only help farmers to minimize waste but also provide restaurants with access to fresh produce at competitive prices.\n\n**Team and Structure**  \nWith a team of 65 dedicated employees, Farmtheory operates under the umbrella of Livingtheory Technologies Pvt. Ltd. The company positions itself within the marketplace and B2B sectors, emphasizing its role as a facilitator of agricultural sustainability while also meeting the needs of culinary businesses.\n\n**Current Activities**  \nFarmtheory continues to develop its platform by actively engaging with both farmers and restaurants, promoting the use of ugly produce to combat food waste and support local agriculture. They also offer a user-friendly app that connects buyers and sellers, making transactions easier and more efficient.\n\nTo learn more about their services or explore their offerings, you can visit [Farmtheory's website](http://farmtheory.in/).\n\nIn short, Farmtheory isn’t just about delivering vegetables; it’s about redefining our relationship with food—and that’s a game-changer."
