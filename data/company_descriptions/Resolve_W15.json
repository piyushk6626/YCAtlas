  "description": "At Resolve we’re building the future of simulations using immersive technology like VR and AR. Today, Resolve helps bridge the communication gap between people who operate buildings and those who design and build them. We've built the most robust application for reviewing industrial facilities on wireless VR devices like the Oculus Quest - our customers love it because it just works even with complex 3D building models.\r\n\nFrom data centers to cutting-edge biopharma facilities, Resolve provides a collaborative virtual environment for operations & maintenance teams to review and interact with 3D building models at full scale - decreasing late stage changes during the construction process and delivering a safer, more easily operable building.\r\n\nOur customers' facilities contain a multitude of complex systems which require careful coordination and review to ensure the building is completed on time and within budget. To prevent rework and increased building maintenance costs, Resolve fixes the broken system of screen-sharing 3D models and 2D floorplans with the operations teams that inherit the building and, instead, gives them easy access to their 3D building models before concrete is poured.",

No sectioning or model prep necessary. Other Quest apps will run at low frame-rates or even crash when handling similar model sizes. In order to connect operations teams to design teams we believe it’s necessary to have both wireless headsets and large models. Hence, Resolve. \\nWhat size model can Resolve handle? \\nThe largest customer model that we ever received was a 1.16 billion (with a b) polygon model. It ran at 72 frames per second on a standalone, wireless Quest 2. Our customers commonly open 5GB Navisworks files and 10gb Revit files. \\nWhat file types does Resolve accept?\\nAny BIM file hosted on Autodesk Construction Cloud, BIM 360 Docs, or Procore. We support 70+ different file formats. We’ve tested Navisworks (NWD), Revit (RVT), Smartplant (VUE) files, IFC, and more.\\nWhich VR or AR headsets does Resolve support?\\nResolve supports the Oculus Quest 2, Quest 3 and Quest Pro. There is a PC companion app to join and follow meetings from your computer if you cannot use a headset. And there is a recently launched app for Apple Vision Pro too!\\nIs this better than using a Link cable?\\nYes. Resolve doesn’t require a connection to an external gaming computer. This makes VR easily accessible from anywhere and saves teams the stress of complex set ups - it just works.\\nRequest a Demo\\nFirst Name*\\nLast Name*\\nWork Email*\\nNon-work emails will not be accepted into trials at this time.\\nCompany*\\nPhone*\\n[Next](https://www.resolvebim.com/<#>)\\nRequest a Demo\\nIs your project or company using ACC or BIM 360 Docs?\\nYesNo\\nIs your project or company using Procore?\\nYesNo\\nHow many Meta Quest VR headsets do you have?Select one...None12-55-1010+\\nHo did you hear about Resolve?Select one...Referred by someoneSearchWeb articleYoutubeLinkedInQuest storeAdOther\\nWhat are your goals?\\nA brief description about what you\\'re trying to accomplish with Resolve\\n[Back](https://www.resolvebim.com/<#>)\\nThank you!\\nWe will send you an email to get started\\nOops!

We support 70+ different file formats. We’ve tested Navisworks (NWD), Revit (RVT), Smartplant (VUE) files, IFC, and more.\\nWhich VR or AR headsets does Resolve support?\\nResolve supports the Oculus Quest 2, Quest 3 and Quest Pro. There is a PC companion app to join and follow meetings from your computer if you cannot use a headset. And there is a recently launched app for Apple Vision Pro too!\\nIs this better than using a Link cable?\\nYes. Resolve doesn’t require a connection to an external gaming computer. This makes VR easily accessible from anywhere and saves teams the stress of complex set ups - it just works.\\nRequest a Demo\\nFirst Name*\\nLast Name*\\nWork Email*\\nNon-work emails will not be accepted into trials at this time.\\nCompany*\\nPhone*\\nNext⟨52⟩\\nRequest a Demo\\nIs your project or company using ACC or BIM 360 Docs?\\nYesNo\\nIs your project or company using Procore?\\nYesNo\\nHow many Meta Quest VR headsets do you have?Select one...None12-55-1010+\\nHo did you hear about Resolve?Select one...Referred by someoneSearchWeb articleYoutubeLinkedInQuest storeAdOther\\nWhat are your goals?\\nA brief description about what you\\'re trying to accomplish with Resolve\\nBack⟨52⟩\\nThank you!\\nWe will send you an email to get started\\nOops!

  "generated_description": "### Company Overview: Resolve\n\n**Company Name:** Resolve  \n**Founded:** 2014  \n**Location:** New York City  \n**Team Size:** 9 employees  \n**Y Combinator Batch:** W15  \n**Group Partner:** Dalton Caldwell  \n\n**Website:** [resolvebim.com](https://www.resolvebim.com)  \n\n---\n\n### Mission\n\nAt Resolve, we’re pioneering the future of operational simulations using immersive virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. Our mission is to facilitate seamless communication between those who operate buildings and the teams that design and construct them.\n\n---\n\n### What We Do\n\nResolve addresses a critical gap in the construction and facility management industries by providing advanced VR simulations. Our flagship application enables operations and maintenance teams to interact with detailed 3D building models, even in complex environments like data centers and biopharma facilities. This immersive technology effectively reduces late-stage changes during construction and enhances overall safety and operability of buildings.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Easy Access to 3D Models:** Resolve allows teams to review and interact with their facilities in real-time using wireless VR devices, such as the Oculus Quest. Unlike other solutions, our technology can handle massive models—up to over a billion polygons—without performance issues.\n- **Enhanced Collaboration:** The immersive platform gathers feedback from stakeholders who typically might not engage deeply in the review process, enabling early identification of issues and streamlining project workflows.\n- **Integrated Workflows:** Resolve works seamlessly with leading BIM tools and integrates with platforms like Autodesk Construction Cloud and Procore, ensuring that the latest design changes are readily available in VR.\n- **Focus on Safety and Sustainability:** By simulating emergency procedures, maintenance routines, and equipment accessibility in a virtual space, buildings can be operated more efficiently and sustainably, reducing waste and improving safety measures.\n\n---\n\n### Customer Impact\n\nOur customers have leveraged Resolve to achieve significant outcomes, including Fortis Construction saving $3 million in rework costs on a major project by utilizing VR for BIM reviews. Other testimonials highlight our solution’s ability to facilitate better decision-making and improve overall project transparency.\n\n---\n\n### Industry Tags\n\n- **Virtual Reality**\n- **Construction**\n- **Design Tools**\n- **Metaverse**\n- **New York**\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn a world increasingly reliant on effective digital tools, Resolve is transforming how the construction and operational management sectors perceive and interact with building models. By merging cutting-edge technology with practical applications, we are laying the groundwork for a more connected, efficient, and safe future in building operations."
