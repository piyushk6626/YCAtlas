Based in Bengaluru, this innovative company started with a simple mission: to facilitate healthcare consultations through popular platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and WhatsApp, supporting patients in 11 local languages. \n\nDocVita understands the unique challenges within the Indian healthcare landscape and addresses them by providing a concierge service for every appointment. This ensures a seamless experience for patients, as they enjoy logistical support while healthcare professionals concentrate on patient care without back-office distractions.\n\nWith a small but mighty team of 14, DocVita addresses a breadth of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, attention disorders, and various personality disorders. They offer different types of therapy, notably Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and more, thereby catering to the diverse needs of their users.\n\nWhat stands out about DocVita is its commitment to creating a customer-centered experience. Each patient is paired with a dedicated care manager who supports them via WhatsApp, ensuring they have guidance throughout their healthcare journey, from finding the right therapist to managing schedules.\n\nAs an emerging marketplace in the realm of consumer health services and telemedicine, DocVita not only connects individuals with qualified mental health professionals but also prioritizes confidentiality and accessibility.
