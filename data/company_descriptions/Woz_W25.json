Woz eliminates this barrier with a team of AI agents that enable anyone, regardless of technical ability, to build products, go to market and grow a business all on one platform without a technical cofounder or inhouse engineering team. \r\n\nOur first customers include a personal trainer building a fitness app for his clients, a property manager building a tool for managing security deposits, a doctor launching a coaching program to augment GLP1s and more. Ultimately, Woz aims to be the default platform where millions of AI-enabled entrepreneurs launch and scale businesses.\r\n\nWoz is built by a team of engineers and ML scientists who've worked together building complex AI systems for the last decade. We're backed by YC, Untapped Ventures, MGV and more.",
