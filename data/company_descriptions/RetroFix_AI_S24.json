Currently, contractors rarely apply for credits because discovering incentives, checking eligibility, and applying are all done manually via emails and phone calls with local utilities and/or government offices. RetroFix consolidates information on government incentives and allows building managers/contractors to apply in minutes, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per building.",
