Ann Emerg Med. 1994;23(1):31-36. doi:10.1016/s0196-0644(94)70004-4\\n_**Author:** Open AI GPT_\\n# Sublingual Nitroglycerin in EMS/Urgent Care\\n## Benefits\\n  * **Rapid Onset:** Sublingual nitroglycerin acts quickly, providing rapid relief of chest pain associated with angina or myocardial infarction.\\n  * **Ease of Administration:** It is easy to administer, especially in pre-hospital settings, as it does not require complex preparation or IV access.\\n  * **Improved Oxygen Supply:** It dilates coronary arteries, improving blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle.\\n  * **Reduced Myocardial Oxygen Demand:** It decreases preload and afterload, reducing the heart\\'s workload and oxygen demand.\\n\\n\\n## Safety Risks without IV Access\\n  * **Hypotension Risk:** Without IV access, managing sudden drops in blood pressure can be challenging, as intravenous fluids cannot be administered promptly.\\n  * **Lack of Immediate Reversal:** If adverse effects occur, such as severe hypotension or bradycardia, there might be delays in administering countermeasures like IV medications.\\n  * **Limited Monitoring:** Without IV access, continuous monitoring and rapid intervention for potential complications are limited.\\n  * **Patient Specific Factors:** Patients with concurrent conditions such as dehydration or on medications like phosphodiesterase inhibitors are at increased risk without a safety net of IV access.\\n\\n\\n## Find answers, not documents.\\n#### Before InpharmD™\\n![BeforeTime⟨25⟩]\\nYour team spends hours per week cobbling together literature from different studies, many behind paywalls, leaving little time for action. \\n![BeforeTime⟨26⟩]\\nTI opportunities are discovered (or presented by third parties) months after the fact, resulting in costly missed savings. \\n![BeforeTime⟨27⟩]\\nDecisions may be made without a complete picture, or pushed out while gathering consensus. \\n#### After InpharmD™\\n![BeforeTime⟨28⟩]\\nInpharmD™ delivers customized, actionable drug information in real time, so you can focus on execution. \\n![BeforeTime⟨29⟩]\\nYour team stays informed immediately when new data emerges or prices change, and you’ll always be the first to know when any changes impact your formulary. \\n![BeforeTime⟨30⟩]\\nWith InpharmD™, your team can make faster, more informed decisions and move forward with confidence. \\n## What Clinical Pharmacists Are Saying...\\nAssists in our research and is a great way or us to get an answer to a medical question without spending an average of 2 hours researching UptoDate or PubMed ourselves.\\n— Jordan C., PharmD, New Jersey\\nHuge time saver with thorough responses.\\n— Jane D., PharmD, Georgia\\nI’d never heard of a DI pharmacist before, now I have one. In. My. Pocket. Amazing!\\nHoly Shhh. Cow! Holy Cow! These summaries are beautiful.\\n— Jane D., PharmD, Georgia\\nI just want to say: This is such a brilliant idea! You people are genius.\\nOH MY GOD WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE!\\nI can’t tell you how much time I spend literature searching. And how I CANNOT STAND PAYWALLS. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!! (covers face for sec) thank you, thank you, thank you!\\nSo they’re basically connecting academic researchers with front line providers and then automating everything. It’s simply brilliant.\\nThe clinical pharmacist was our secret weapon anyway. (Smiles wryly) This pharmacist AI seems superhuman. I’m just blown away, honestly. (Looks at camera somberly.)\\nIt’s an ENTIRE DI DEPARTMENT, that lives in Epic. Give me a second. I’m just having a hard time wrapping my head around that.\\nSorry just give me a second, my mind is blown.\\nStop reading and just download the app already! I’ve tried all of them. This is by far the most advanced, best-in-class.\\n# What would you like to ask InpharmD™?\\nSign up for a free trial & start right away.\\nGet Started Free⟨4⟩\\nGet Started Free⟨4⟩\\n  * FAQs⟨31⟩\\n  * Fellowship Opportunities⟨32⟩\\n  * Rotation Opportunities⟨33⟩\\n\\n\\n  * Privacy Policy⟨34⟩\\n  * Terms of Use⟨35⟩\\n  * Press⟨36⟩\\n  * Careers⟨37⟩\\n  * Events⟨38⟩\\n\\n\\n  *  Facebook⟨39⟩\\n  *  Twitter⟨40⟩\\n  *  LinkedIn⟨41⟩\\n  *  Instagram⟨42⟩\\n\\n\\n ![⟨43⟩](https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/apps.apple.com/in/app/inpharmd/id734187524?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4>) ![⟨44⟩](https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inpharmd.android.inpharmd&hl=en_US>)\\n**Questions?** Contact us at support@inpharmd.com\\n' references_markdown='\\n\\n## References\\n\\n⟨1⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/assets/logo-no-tagline-194aff1c3a059b4edb23b14991f42f9d0453ef725c996084763d7f1282e55cd0.png:  ![\\n⟨2⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</signup>: Sign Up\\n⟨3⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</login>: Log In\\n⟨4⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</provider_signup/team>: Get Started Free\\n⟨5⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#background0>: Background\\n⟨6⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#literature-review0>: Literature Review\\n⟨7⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#references0>: References\\n⟨8⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/inpharmd.com/inquiries/4dbbf722b1b478e07625032e5af2860ded08cfd46785796d2e2210fe2d41f72f>: READ MORE→\\n⟨9⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#background1>: Background\\n⟨10⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#literature-review1>: Literature Review\\n⟨11⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#references1>: References\\n⟨12⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/inpharmd.com/inquiries/1c3e3d0db871a273d4b546aa75740c8c701981b96a9cd7bbfa2f375ede1f5042>: READ MORE→\\n⟨13⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#background2>: Background\\n⟨14⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#literature-review2>: Literature Review\\n⟨15⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#references2>: References\\n⟨16⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/inpharmd.com/inquiries/d714fe83c935631e266eceb83b79beb4362dba5dfec258c6da3b235789db247a>: READ MORE→\\n⟨17⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#background3>: Background\\n⟨18⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#literature-review3>: Literature Review\\n⟨19⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#references3>: References\\n⟨20⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/inpharmd.com/inquiries/694686fea0e7c7d5cc83341b70a7e00cd7a969584b922f02924031eff4136c5f>: READ MORE→\\n⟨21⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#background4>: Background\\n⟨22⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#literature-review4>: Literature Review\\n⟨23⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<#references4>: References\\n⟨24⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/inpharmd.com/inquiries/a81b2fe015d5d1a9ab597937a8ce563db5a692f2a9bd2078454fba9630b0e597>: READ MORE→\\n⟨25⟩ https://inpharmd-asset.s3.amazonaws.com/web/Time_Red.png: BeforeTime\\n⟨26⟩ https://inpharmd-asset.s3.amazonaws.com/web/PT_Opportunities_Red.png: BeforeTime\\n⟨27⟩ https://inpharmd-asset.s3.amazonaws.com/web/Decisions_Red.png: BeforeTime\\n⟨28⟩ https://inpharmd-asset.s3.amazonaws.com/web/Time_Green.png: BeforeTime\\n⟨29⟩ https://inpharmd-asset.s3.amazonaws.com/web/PT_Opportunities_Green.png: BeforeTime\\n⟨30⟩ https://inpharmd-asset.s3.amazonaws.com/web/Decisions_Green.png: BeforeTime\\n⟨31⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</faq>: FAQs\\n⟨32⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</fellowship>: Fellowship Opportunities\\n⟨33⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</rotation_opportunities>: Rotation Opportunities\\n⟨34⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</privacy_policy>: Privacy Policy\\n⟨35⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</terms_of_use>: Terms of Use\\n⟨36⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</press>: Press\\n⟨37⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</careers>: Careers\\n⟨38⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/</events>: Events\\n⟨39⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/www.facebook.com/Inpharmd>:  Facebook\\n⟨40⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/twitter.com/InPharmD>:  Twitter\\n⟨41⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/inpharmd>:  LinkedIn\\n⟨42⟩ https://www.inpharmd.com/<https:/www.instagram.com/_InpharmD/?hl=en>:  Instagram\\n⟨43⟩ https://inpharmd-asset.s3.amazonaws.com/web/apple-store.svg:  ![\\n⟨44⟩ https://inpharmd-asset.s3.amazonaws.com/web/google-play.svg:  ![\\n' fit_markdown='' fit_html=''",

In fact, InpharmD has already saved over 94,000 clinical pharmacist hours.\n\nWith a small but impactful team of 16 employees, InpharmD is leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance the speed and accuracy of medical literature searches. To date, they are trusted by more than 20,000 healthcare providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists.\n\nThe company’s technology is particularly relevant in the fields of telemedicine and B2B services, as it addresses the urgent need for rapid access to reliable clinical information. \n\nLed by Jared Friedman as Group Partner, InpharmD simplifies the research process, allowing healthcare practitioners to focus more on patient care rather than getting lost in journals and paywalls. As a burgeoning tool in the medical community, it stands out for its commitment to improving the workflow of clinical professionals.\n\nInpharmD embodies the transformation we often discuss in healthcare—a shift that prioritizes actionable advice over sifting through endless documents.
