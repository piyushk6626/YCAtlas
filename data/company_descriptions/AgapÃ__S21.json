The highest form of love.Fun Fact: In English speaking countries Agapé is pronounced \"ah-gah-pay\" but if you go to Greece it\\'s pronounced \"Ah-gah-pee\".

A common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for couples who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction.

Couples therapy is focused on solving a problem. Agapé is focused on creating a fun way to spark meaningful conversation.Often times that conversation makes you smile. Occasionally you may even cry tears of joy. And sometimes it even solves problems! But the primary goal is to create a fun way to spark meaningful conversation, which is fundamentally different than couples therapy.\\nHow does Agapé keep my info safe?\\nAgapé values your privacy.
