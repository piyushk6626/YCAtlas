  "description": "Current Description: RTHM provides virtual-first care for complex illness including Long COVID, ME/CFS, POTS, and mast cell activation.  Many clinics focus on teaching patients how to better cope with symptoms, which is helpful, but we don’t stop there.  We develop collaborations & partnerships so our patients access to the most promising testing and root-cause directed early therapies for their illness(es) with the goal of simplifying and streamlining the most efficient and effective clinical pathways so they can be scaled in the form of low cost online modules overseen remotely by clinicians.  \r\n\nIn conjunction with clinical care, RTHM operates a clinical lab and collects deep molecular data with robust clinical context to develop AI-powered diagnostics and better ways of predicting which treatments may work best for whom.",

Every symptom and treatment tried by a patient provides clues in their journey to getting back to health. That is why we aggregate our patients\\' experiences and deploy the learnings through our treatment pathways. At RTHM, you benefit from the latest medical research and from the experience of other patients similar to you. We leverage the latest science and the data from all of our patients to find the most effective treatment course in the least amount of time.\\n![what do you mean, my labs were normal?](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/what-do-you-mean-my-labs-were-normal.png)\\n### Discover what works\\nA shorter path to effective treatment: in complex illness there are often several underlying health issues that need to be addressed using multiple treatments. We learn from what has worked from patients similar to you to efficiently find the best combination of treatments for you.

Additionally, not every patient is the same. Through our partnership with patients and research labs, we aim to advance science through discovering biomarkers to better understand, diagnose, and treat these illnesses.\\n![patients as partners, a woman consulting her doctor via virtual meeting.](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/patients-as-partners.png)\\n![Dr. Curtin, experienced ME/CFS physician and Long-Covid expert, gazing into the distance, symbolizing her personal journey and commitment to helping Long-Covid patients at our clinic.](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/headshot-1.jpg) ![Confident and smiling Dr. Kellogg, Stanford University scientist and pioneer in molecular profiling technology, symbolizing advancement in real-time health monitoring for complex illnesses at our clinic.](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/headshot-2.jpg) ![Dr. Snyder, head of Stanford\\'s Healthcare Innovation Lab and pioneer in wearable technology for health tracking, looking confident, symbolizing his dedication to predicting and detecting disease changes at RTHM clinic](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/headshot-3.jpg)\\n## It’s personal for us.\\n### The RTHM founding team has worked for over a decade in the lab and in the clinic understanding and treating complex and post-infectious illness - because we are patients ourselves.\\n[Meet the team](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/rthm.com/team/>)\\n[ ![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stat.svg) ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.statnews.com/2023/03/07/blood-test-home-stanford-theranos-snyder/>) [ ![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Atlantic.svg) ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/mecfs-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-doctors-long-covid/671518/>) [ ![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/USA-Today.svg) ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/01/19/stanford-michael-snyder-microsample-blood-health-insights/11076042002/>) [ ![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Popular-Science.svg) ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.popsci.com/health/long-covid-care-chronic-illness/>) [ ![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/NPR-Symbol-1-2.png) ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/09/1198342040/long-covid-causes-treatment-research>)\\n[ ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/rthm.com>)\\n  * [How it works](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/rthm.com/how-it-works/>)\\n  * [Team](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/rthm.com/team/>)\\n  * [Resources](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/rthm.com/learn/>)\\n  * [FAQ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/rthm.com/faq/>)\\n  * [Refer a Patient](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/rthm.com/rthm-patient-referral/>)\\n\\n\\n[ ![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/twitter-footer.svg) ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/twitter.com/RTHM_Health>) [ ![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/facebook-footer.svg) ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.facebook.com/HealthRTHM>) [ ![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instagram-footer.svg) ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.instagram.com/rthm_health/>) [ ![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Youtube.svg) ](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.youtube.com/@RTHM_Health>)\\n### Real Time Health Monitoring.\\nRTHM integrates remote clinical medicine and research with advanced molecular and digital measurement technologies to bring new diagnostics and treatments to patients faster, starting with Long COVID.\\n[![Verify Approval for www.rthm.com](https://static.legitscript.com/seals/15482469.png)](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.legitscript.com/websites/?checker_keywords=rthm.com> \"Verify LegitScript Approval for www.rthm.com\")\\n[ Back to Top ](https://www.rthm.com/<#header>)\\nJoin our mailing list \\nPhone: (408) 508-4163 (call or text)\\nFax: (888) 789-1402\\nHours: Monday - Friday 9a-5p PT\\nEmail (clinic): support@rthm.com\\nEmail (lab): lab@rthm.com\\n2261 Market Street #10535, San Francisco, CA 94114\\nCopyright © Rthm, Inc.\\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/rthm.com/privacy-policy/>) | support@rthm.com\\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires that detailed information about payment and other payments of value worth over ten dollars ($10) from manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, and biologics to physicians and teaching hospitals be made available to the public.\\n[Facebook](https://www.rthm.com/</#facebook> \"Facebook\")[X](https://www.rthm.com/</#x> \"X\")[![Share](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/social-share-icon-2.svg)](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Frthm.com%2F&title=RTHM%20Long%20COVID%20and%20Complex%20Illness%20Telehealth%20Clinic>)\\n✓\\nThanks for sharing!\\n[AddToAny](https://www.rthm.com/<https:/www.addtoany.com> \"Share Buttons\")\\n[More…](https://www.rthm.com/<#addtoany> \"Show all\")\\n' markdown_with_citations='![](https://rthm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Group.svg)\\nNow live!

  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: RTHM**\n\nFounded in 2018 and hailing from Redwood City, CA, RTHM is revolutionizing the way we approach complex illness care. Part of Y Combinator's Batch W22, this innovative health tech startup is on a mission to \"simplify complex illness care at scale,\" addressing challenging conditions like Long COVID, ME/CFS, POTS, and mast cell activation syndrome.\n\n**What They Do:**\n\nRTHM is not just another telemedicine service. Unlike traditional clinics that merely help patients manage their symptoms, RTHM dives deep into the underlying issues. They partner with advanced clinical labs and develop AI-powered diagnostics, which facilitate a comprehensive understanding of each patient's unique health landscape. This allows for personalized and root-cause-directed therapies.\n\nTheir services include:\n- **RTHM Direct**: A more accessible offering that starts at $49 for online assessments. Patients can access treatments within a business day without needing in-person visits.\n- **RTHM Clinic**: A premium membership providing extensive lab access and multiple clinician visits throughout the year for a more hands-on approach to treatment.\n\n**Approach and Innovation:**\n\nAt RTHM, the focus is on patient collaboration. They enrich their treatment pathways by learning from the experiences of patients, which helps refine their methods continually. Their integration of remote clinical medicine with advanced molecular data allows them to deliver cutting-edge solutions faster.\n\nWith a dedicated team of 14 employees, RTHM emphasizes building personalized care pathways. Their goal is to aggregate patient experiences into a broad repository of knowledge that can shorten treatment timelines and enhance outcomes.\n\n**Why It Matters:**\n\nIn an era when healthcare can often feel impersonal, RTHM stands out by reinforcing the notion that care should be tailored to the individual's needs. Their insight into complex illnesses is grounded not just in clinical expertise but also in a real understanding of patient journeys—they're driven by their own past experiences in the field.\n\n**Current Offerings and Future Goals:**\n\nRTHM has plans to expand its services further across the United States to reach more patients who need help navigating these complex conditions. By leveraging their existing partnerships and clinical infrastructure, they're set to make significant strides in how chronic diseases are diagnosed and treated.\n\nTo learn more, visit their website at [RTHM](https://www.rthm.com). Whether you're wrestling with a complex illness or advocating for someone who is, RTHM aims to be a beacon of hope and a guide on the path to recovery."
