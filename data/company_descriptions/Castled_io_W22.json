  "generated_description": "**Castled.io: Revolutionizing Customer Engagement through Data Warehouses**\n\nFounded in 2021 and hailing from Bengaluru, India, Castled.io is a customer engagement platform that's redefining how marketers interact with their data. Being part of Y Combinator's Winter 2022 batch, this startup is making waves with its innovative approach to customer engagement by leveraging existing data in cloud data warehouses like BigQuery and Snowflake.\n\n**What Makes Castled.io Different?**\n\nUnlike conventional platforms like Braze, CustomerIO, or MoEngage, Castled.io doesn’t store your customer data.

This flexibility allows brands to engage their customers where they are, ensuring a cohesive communication strategy.\n\n**Addressing Pain Points:**\n\nCastled.io was born out of necessity, addressing the glaring inadequacies of traditional customer engagement platforms:\n- **Data Fragmentation**: It helps unify customer data scattered across multiple platforms.\n- **Cost Efficiency**: The platform does not charge based on the volume of customer data stored, allowing companies to save on costs.\n- **Vendor Lock-In**: By allowing companies to maintain control over their data, Castled helps avoid the pitfalls of being locked into a single vendor.\n- **Data Security**: The customer data remains protected and never leaves your own data warehouse.\n\n**Why Choose Castled.io?**\n\nWith a small but dedicated team of eight, Castled.io has already made significant strides, empowering brands across ten countries. Its unique warehouse-native approach and focus on helping marketers create effective, personalized engagement campaigns set it apart. Customers report significant savings—up to 70%—on their engagement costs thanks to its efficient model.\n\nIn a world where customer interactions matter more than ever, Castled.io offers a compelling solution that combines the power of your data with smart, flexible tools to enhance customer engagement.
