This allows us to verify your account\\'s authenticity and prevent fraud.\\nWhat\\'s a \"Verified\" email?\\nAfter enriching decision maker emails they will either be labeled as \"verified\" or \"unknown\". \"Verified\" emails are emails that have been checked by our system and that it can be delivered. \"Unknown\"emails are ones that are not able to be fully verified but are able to be delivered to around 80% of the time.\\nHow do we verify emails and phone numbers for leads?\\nEmail and phone numbers are verified by cross-referencing a number of different data vendors.\\nHow can I find more information on my leads? e.g. find dental clinics that are closed on Saturdays.\\nThere are 2 ways to do that:\\u200d1. Use AI leads finder and input filtering criteria. e.g. \"closed on Saturdays\"2. Use the \"add enrichment\" function in your leads list to return custom data.\\nWhy are there fewer results in my list even though I exported a lot of them?\\nWhen you export from the AI Leads Finder, the total number of leads is sometimes just an estimate rather than an exact count.\\n![logo](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658be563adc727c27b27070b/6724319567afcbb10436819a_Group%205%20\\\\(4\\\\).svg)\\nCompany\\n[About Us](https://www.openmart.com/<https:/www.ycombinator.com/companies/openmart>)[Launch YC](https://www.openmart.com/<https:/www.ycombinator.com/companies/openmart>)[Announcement](https://www.openmart.com/<https:/techcrunch.com/2024/08/21/openmart-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-enterprises-to-sell-to-local-businesses/>)\\nBlog\\n[Live Case](https://www.openmart.com/<#>)[Product tutorial](https://www.openmart.com/<#>)[Our Thoughts](https://www.openmart.com/</blog>)\\nLegal\\n[Terms](https://www.openmart.com/</terms-of-use>)[Privacy policy](https://www.openmart.com/</privacy-policy>)[Cookies policy](https://www.openmart.com/</cookie-policy>)[Disclaimer](https://www.openmart.com/</disclaimer>)\\nInformation\\n[About Us](https://www.openmart.com/<https:/techcrunch.com/2024/08/21/openmart-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-enterprises-to-sell-to-local-businesses/>)[FAQ’s](https://www.openmart.com/<#>)sales@openmart.com\\n© Openmart 2024.
