  "generated_description": "### EnvKey: Your Secure Secrets Management Solution\n\n**Introduction**\nEnvKey is a San Francisco-based startup, proudly part of Y Combinator's Batch W18, focused on end-to-end encrypted secrets and configuration management. With a minimal team of just two employees, EnvKey offers a developer-friendly approach to managing sensitive information like API keys and database credentials safely.\n\n**Mission and Features**\nThe core mission of EnvKey is simple yet crucial in today's tech landscape: to provide secure, encrypted management of configuration and secrets while ensuring no third party, including EnvKey itself, has access to your sensitive data.
