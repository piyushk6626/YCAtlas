  "generated_description": "Plickers is a game-changer in classroom assessment, embodying the mantra “Data without devices.” Founded in 2011 and part of Y Combinator's Batch IK12, Plickers aims to simplify formative assessments for teachers and their students. The company, based in San Francisco, operates with a nimble team of just five employees, under the guidance of Group Partner Nan.\n\nSo, what exactly is Plickers? At its core, it's an innovative tool that allows teachers to conduct real-time polls without requiring each student to have a device. Instead, each student gets a unique QR code card. The teacher scans these cards with their smartphone to gather responses for checks-for-understanding, exit tickets, and quick polls—all without the distractions of classroom tech. The beauty of Plickers lies in its data collection; responses are saved automatically on Plickers.com, providing detailed insights on student performance, lesson effectiveness, and engagement.\n\nWhat’s more, Plickers has gained traction worldwide, being utilized by K-12 educators in over 100 countries. Teachers love it; they rave about its ability to inject fun into lessons and provide instant feedback. Social media is dotted with testimonials from educators who say their students enjoy the interactive elements, describing it as playing a game while assessing knowledge.\n\nIf you're an educator looking for a fresh, engaging teaching tool, Plickers is worth checking out. You can sign up for free at [Plickers.com](http://www.plickers.com) and join the growing community of educators making assessments more intuitive and enjoyable."
