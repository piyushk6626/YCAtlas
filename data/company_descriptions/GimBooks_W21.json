Thankfully, I discovered GimBooks! This is just what my garment shop needed. It lets me create bills for different types of clothing items and keeps track of my stock levels in various sizes and colours. Plus, it's easy to use and helps me generate reports to see which styles are most popular. With GimBooks, managing my garment shop has become a breeze!\\n#### **Abhishek Verma, Steel Trader**\\n#### 5\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63b94f65d61fc81a66af113a/660fa3752e34cff85a33e27a_star%20\\\\(4\\\\).png)\\nI was hesitant to try a new billing app at first, but I'm so glad I gave GimBooks a chance. It's perfect for my small steel trading business. I can create professional-looking invoices with my company logo in seconds. It also helps me track my inventory and low stock alerts ensure I never run out of important supplies. The app is in Hindi too, which makes things even easier for me.\\n## Supported By\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63b94f65d61fc81a66af113a/640087d1f1a4de9ed3009752_Y%20Combinator.webp)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63b94f65d61fc81a66af113a/640087d158862269836dfb28_Upekkha.webp)![DPIIT \\\\(Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade\\\\) Logo for Indian Government's E-Invoicing initiative⟨18⟩]\\n![Gimbooks Footer logo⟨1⟩]Gim Info Solutions Pvt Ltd. 2nd Floor, House No. 106/3, Avanti Vihar road, sector 3, Gitanjali Nagar, Raipur 492001.
