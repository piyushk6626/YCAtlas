With fully custom AI CSRs natively integrated with your lead sources and CRM, you can use targeted campaigns to increase conversion across your funnel while decreasing overhead costs. Turn conversations into revenue with Hatch.\\n### How does Hatch AI work?\\nHatch AI allows you to build custom AI agents that converse with your contacts over text, phone, and email.\\nEach bot has a name, a personality, a business profile to reference, and a directive (like to qualify leads, book appointments, or follow up on quotes). You then give it a series of instructions, called prompts, on how to complete that directive. Finally, you set rules so the bot knows when to transfer to a human, how to handle objections, and when to part ways with a contact.\\n### Do I need to be tech-savvy to use Hatch AI?\\nNope. Hatch AI does not require any coding or complex setups. All of the prompts and instructions you give are in plain language, like \"Ask the customer what day and time works best for them.\" \\nKeep in mind also that:\\n  * The bot builder has a sandbox to test changes before going live.\\n  * We offer best-practice templates.\\n  * You\\'ll get a white-glove onboarding with ongoing dedicated support.\\n\\n\\n### Can I really trust a bot to interact with my customers?\\nSure can. Your bot will follow your prompts and rules so that it behaves exactly as you want, and you\\'ll have a test conversation window right in the bot builder so you can test out refinements before going live. \\nAnd as we mentioned above, you\\'ll have the tools and human guidance to make sure you\\'ve set it up properly.\\nYou might like to know that our customers are now using bot conversation transcripts to train their humans—they\\'re  _that_ effective.\\n### What does it mean that Hatch uses \"generative AI\"?\\nGenerative AI is AI that can come up with its own content. So while prescriptive AI takes existing data and makes suggestions, such as “Follow up with this customer,” generative AI can actually come up with the actual follow up message for the customer. And Hatch AI takes that a step further: your bots will text customers for you and hold authentic conversations with them.\\n[ ![Hatch Logo White](https://www.usehatchapp.com/hubfs/Logos/Hatch%20Logos/Hatch%20Logo%20White.png) ](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/home-january-2023>)\\n[![G2 Award - Users Love Us](https://www.usehatchapp.com/hs-fs/hubfs/users-love-us-4fca521cb6d80c30d02e3df6bd0013f5395fb3ae22e81b3e3608e258d8feba63%20\\\\(1\\\\)-png-1.png?width=75&height=98&name=users-love-us-4fca521cb6d80c30d02e3df6bd0013f5395fb3ae22e81b3e3608e258d8feba63%20\\\\(1\\\\)-png-1.png)](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.g2.com/products/hatchify-hatch/reviews>)\\n[ ](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.facebook.com/usehatch>) [ ](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/usehatchapp/>) \\n\\n### What is Hatch?\\n  * [Overview](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/product>)\\n  * [Solutions](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/solutions>)\\n  * [Partners & Integrations](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/integrations>)\\n\\n\\n### Why Hatch?\\n  * [Why Hatch?](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/why-hatch>)\\n  * [Who We Serve](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/industries>)\\n  * [Success Stories](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/testimonials>)\\n\\n\\n### Resources\\n  * [eBooks & Guides](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/resources>)\\n  * [Webinars](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.bigmarker.com/communities/usehatchapp/conferences>)\\n  * [Help Center](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/knowledge>)\\n  * [Careers](http://usehatchapp.com/<https:/www.usehatchapp.com/careers>)\\n\\n\\n© 2024 Hatchify, Inc.
