  "generated_description": "### Theya: Simplifying Bitcoin Self-Custody\n\n**Overview**\nFounded in 2023 and a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch W23, Theya is headquartered in San Francisco and comprises a tight-knit team of three. Theya's mission is crystal clear: to provide the world’s simplest Bitcoin self-custody solution, catering especially to users who find traditional crypto exchanges intimidating and hardware wallets complex. \n\n**The Problem They Solve**\nFor many, the crypto world feels fraught with risk. Users are often torn between the convenience of centralized exchanges and the safety of hardware wallets. Theya steps into this gap by offering a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet that's compatible with smartphones. It provides a user-friendly experience that's seamless yet secure, giving users the power to safeguard their Bitcoin without drowning in complexity.\n\n**The Vision**\nTheya is not just about wallets—it aims to become the go-to consumer application for Bitcoin. Their product lineup is poised to expand into areas like accumulation, lending, investments, and payments—all wrapped within their intuitive self-custody platform.
