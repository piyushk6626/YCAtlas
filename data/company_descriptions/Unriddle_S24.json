  "description": "We build tools to help people think and work better.\r\n\nToday, Unriddle helps researchers and students quickly find insights in documents, video and audio so they can learn and write faster. \r\n\nWe started working on Unriddle 18 months ago. In that time:\r\n- we’ve grown to 3M users spanning hundreds of major colleges and research-led companies,\r\n- we hit $1.5M in yearly revenue and are fast approaching our next milestone of $2M,\r\n- 100M+ people have seen our content across Instagram, TikTok and YouTube,\r\n- and we raised a $2.4M seed with checks from YC and the founders of Github and Reddit.\r\n\nLooking ahead, we're expanding beyond just summarization and writing assistance to address the broader challenges of information overload faced by researchers and students.\r\n\nWe're a small, tight-knit team with huge ambitions. As a founding member of the team, you'll be instrumental in helping us scale revenue from $1M to $10M and then $10M to $100M+.\r\n\nIf you’re excited by the idea of being a part of that, definitely apply.",
