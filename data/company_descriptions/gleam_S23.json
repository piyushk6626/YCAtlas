  "generated_description": "**Gleam: Simplifying Employee Benefits in Just 15 Minutes**\n\nFounded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator's S23 batch, Gleam is an innovative financial technology company based in [Nan](https://www.gleamcare.com/) that’s revolutionizing how businesses deal with employee benefits. With a simple mission—\"Seamless benefits in 15 minutes\"—Gleam allows companies to set up comprehensive medical, dental, vision, and life insurance plans for their teams, and astonishingly, for free.\n\n### What They Do\n\nGleam is essentially an all-in-one platform for employee benefits management. In just a quarter of an hour, you can manage everything from insurance quotes to payroll automation and compliance. The product offerings include:\n\n- **Employee Benefits**: Tailored insurance packages that meet individual needs while managing costs efficiently.\n- **HRAs (Health Reimbursement Arrangements)**: These not only provide flexible benefit options but also help companies reduce premium costs.\n\nGleam’s streamlined approach can save HR professionals significant time during the hectic open enrollment period by automating many tasks, which means fewer errors and less manual paperwork.\n\n### Business Model\n\nInterestingly, Gleam operates on a cost-free model for businesses, as they monetize through insurance carriers and brokers. They only charge for optional add-ons, like their HRA plans, which cost $5 per enrollee per month, and premium support—which includes dedicated onboarding and priority services—for $35 a month.\n\n### The Team\n\nWith a lean team of two, Gleam is nimble and perfectly positioned to adapt to the fast-paced startup environment. Their Group Partner, Aaron Epstein, brings a wealth of experience and connections, which can only bolster their growing reputation in the fintech and healthcare sectors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs we march into a future where employee benefits are pivotal in attracting and retaining talent, Gleam is not just keeping up; they’re leading the charge towards innovation in the financial tech and health insurance spaces. If you’re a business leader or HR professional looking to simplify your benefits management, Gleam is worth checking out. \n\nVisit them at [Gleam Care](https://www.gleamcare.com/) for a demo, or simply to explore how they can elevate your benefits strategy in a matter of minutes."
