To perform sequence alignment, a reference genome is needed. One technology for spatial transcriptomics is 10x Genomics Visium which uses a slide array of spots, each containing barcoded oligonucleotides, to capture mRNA from tissue sections placed on the slide. The mRNA then undergoes high-throughput RNA sequencing. The raw results from Visium experiments include a microscopy image of the tissue slice on the Visium slide and sequencing reads in FASTQ format. In order to use this data to reveal insights into cellular microenvironments, cellular heterogeneity, and spatial relationships within tissue, the data require processing, including the typical steps taken for processing RNA sequencing reads, as well as tissue detection and determination of which barcode spots overlap with the tissue.⟨18⟩![Split-screen image of spatial transcriptomics, the visualizaition and quantification of gene expression in tissue sections while maintain the context of tissue architecture.
