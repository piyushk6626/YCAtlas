You can design, publish, view and interact with content in augmented reality, superimposing work instructions or even 3D designs (e.g., CAD files) on real world objects. The platform supports a range of content, including work instructions, training materials, aptitude tests and more. WorkLink streamlines the creation, management, and optimization of this content, while also facilitating integration with other enterprise systems, like Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. \\nHow do I make AR content? \\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5a67/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5ab1_chevron-down.png)\\nWith WorkLink by Scope AR, creating augmented reality content is a seamless experience that leverages your existing CAD files. You can quickly design and publish interactive AR experiences directly from any modern web browser on PC or Mac. Create a project and upload a CAD file, and you can quickly start creating interactive experiences with your content. Designed for ease of use, WorkLink allows you to realize AR projects quickly, even without extensive training. We also offer a 3-day on-site course to empower authors, enabling them to construct complex projects post-training. Alternatively, if you prefer to focus on your core business, let our professional services team handle the content creation for you. At Scope AR, we're committed to providing you with the tools and support you need to succeed in the world of augmented reality. \\nWhat kind of ROI should I expect from Augmented Reality (AR)? \\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5a67/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5ab1_chevron-down.png)\\nAugmented reality (AR) typically delivers ROI through time and travel savings, enhanced quality, and reduced loss, with the extent of benefits varying by application. For instance, companies that frequently send technicians to repair large equipment, might see over $1 million in travel savings per year by empowering on-the-ground technicians with AR to diagnose and repair issues, avoiding costs like flights, hotels, and incidentals. Similarly sectors with high-stakes, like satellite manufacturing, can prevent costly errors that translate to massive savings. We recommend doing a proof of concept (POC) in order to quantify the specific ROI you will see from AR in your own use case. [Schedule a consultation today](http://scopear.com/<https:/get.scopear.com/schedule-a-consultation>) to see how AR can impact your business. \\nWhat Use Cases are best suited for WorkLink? \\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5a67/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5ab1_chevron-down.png)\\nFrom streamlining production processes to capturing and distributing expert knowledge, WorkLink offers significant and measurable benefits tailored to each operational need. Here are just a few examples of some of client’s use-cases: **Work Instructions:** Our platform enables users with no prior coding knowledge to create rich, engaging augmented reality instructions. By facilitating the in-house creation of AR instruction manuals, WorkLink accelerates the production process, reduces production costs, and improves security.**\\u200dCost-Effective Training Solutions:** The high costs associated with training, especially in contexts of high turnover and short tenures, necessitate a more efficient approach. WorkLink's AR platform offers a hands-on, experiential learning environment where new engineers can rapidly upskill through engaging with realistic simulations and interactive guides, thus accelerating the learning curve, reducing training expenses, and enhancing retention of critical information. \\u200d**AR-Guided Work Instructions:** WorkLink's AR capabilities revolutionize the delivery of information on the job. Through augmented reality, engineers can access real-time, 3-D-aware instructions and data directly on the products they are building or servicing, eliminating the need to refer back to manuals or navigate through cumbersome paperwork, which enhances efficiency and reduces the likelihood of errors. \\u200d**Bridging the Expertise Gap:** As the skilled workforce ages, there is a pressing need to capture and transfer their invaluable knowledge to newer employees. WorkLink facilitates this through immersive collaboration and guided instructions, enabling experienced workers to create and share their insights in an interactive, AR-based format. This process not only preserves critical knowledge but also makes it readily accessible to less experienced staff, ensuring continuity and consistency in maintenance quality. \\u200d**Reducing Paper Dependency:** Digitizing highly situational-aware maintenance workflows and instructions significantly reduces paper usage, contributing to green initiatives. This transition not only supports sustainability efforts but also streamlines processes, making information management more efficient and less prone to loss or damage. \\nAre Scope AR and WorkLink secure? \\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5a67/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5ab1_chevron-down.png)\\nYes, security is a top priority at Scope AR.

By facilitating the in-house creation of AR instruction manuals, WorkLink accelerates the production process, reduces production costs, and improves security.**\\u200dCost-Effective Training Solutions:** The high costs associated with training, especially in contexts of high turnover and short tenures, necessitate a more efficient approach. WorkLink's AR platform offers a hands-on, experiential learning environment where new engineers can rapidly upskill through engaging with realistic simulations and interactive guides, thus accelerating the learning curve, reducing training expenses, and enhancing retention of critical information. \\u200d**AR-Guided Work Instructions:** WorkLink's AR capabilities revolutionize the delivery of information on the job. Through augmented reality, engineers can access real-time, 3-D-aware instructions and data directly on the products they are building or servicing, eliminating the need to refer back to manuals or navigate through cumbersome paperwork, which enhances efficiency and reduces the likelihood of errors. \\u200d**Bridging the Expertise Gap:** As the skilled workforce ages, there is a pressing need to capture and transfer their invaluable knowledge to newer employees. WorkLink facilitates this through immersive collaboration and guided instructions, enabling experienced workers to create and share their insights in an interactive, AR-based format. This process not only preserves critical knowledge but also makes it readily accessible to less experienced staff, ensuring continuity and consistency in maintenance quality. \\u200d**Reducing Paper Dependency:** Digitizing highly situational-aware maintenance workflows and instructions significantly reduces paper usage, contributing to green initiatives. This transition not only supports sustainability efforts but also streamlines processes, making information management more efficient and less prone to loss or damage. \\nAre Scope AR and WorkLink secure? \\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5a67/6723986c9d82a2d79a1f5ab1_chevron-down.png)\\nYes, security is a top priority at Scope AR.
