I think that\\'s because we use InEvent for various things—not only for our signature conference, it is becoming a part of our brand. It\\'s an expectation that people won\\'t get disconnected. We don\\'t have to use various solutions; one for registration, one for the meeting, and one after the meeting. We can do a lot of communication within one tool, which has been helpful. ![\\'](https://static.inevent.com/images/quotes-2.png) ](https://inevent.com/<dudley-flood-center-events-management-strategy-education-school.php>)\\n[ ![Charity Araoz](https://static.inevent.com/images/pcs-hybrid-charity-araoz.png) Charity Araoz VP of Marketing at PCS Software Inc ![\\'](https://static.inevent.com/images/quotes-1.png) InEvent was always on-the-ball with any questions that I may have.

Everything is seamlessly integrated and accessible 24/7 through a cloud-based interface, setting them apart from many competitors whose modules often fail to communicate effectively.\n\nAs of now, InEvent has supported over **12,400 events** and facilitated more than **2.39 million registrations**. Their impressive roster of integrations includes industry giants like Salesforce, Marketo, Oracle, and Microsoft, building a simple, user-friendly marketing ecosystem for their customers.\n\n**Key Features**\n\nInEvent offers a host of features tailored for various event types, including:\n- **Virtual Lobby**: A sophisticated environment for hosting events that can drive engagement effectively.\n- **Event Registration**: Customized workflows that streamline the registration process.\n- **Mobile App**: A way for attendees to navigate events, access schedules, and network easily.\n- **Live Studio**: Allows for high-quality broadcasting of live events, facilitating top-notch virtual experiences.\n\nYou can explore their platform further through their extensive solutions laid out by industry, event type, and user role, all geared towards enhancing the event experience.\n\n**Current Vision and Values**\n\nInEvent's goal transcends simple event management. They aim to create engaging, memorable experiences while ensuring efficiency and flexibility for organizers. With a strong commitment to customer support, they emphasize the importance of feeling accompanied throughout the event planning journey.\n\n**Why InEvent?**\n\nIn a world where events increasingly blend both physical and digital realms, InEvent proves to be an invaluable partner. The reliance on powerful technology combined with a talented support team positions them as a forward-thinking leader in the event management space.
