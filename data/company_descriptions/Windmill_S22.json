  "description": "Windmill is an open-source developer platform to quickly build production-grade multi-step internal apps, workflows and integrations from minimal Python and Typescript scripts. \r\n\nOpen-source alternative to Airplane and Pipedream. Simplified temporal with automatic app generation. Usable as a self-hosted AWS Lambda. \r\n\nSync your scripts from your github repo or write them directly on Windmill, have them be converted to apps and no-code modules automatically. Use those apps as standalone or, build powerful flows using either those scripts or scripts made by the community on hub.windmill.dev. The experience is similar to no-code tools except that at any point, any module can have its code inspected and tweaked. Leveraging the open-source community, we will build an exhaustive library of scripts for all apis and generic tasks.\r\n\nYou may also wrap Windmill with your own frontend to provide automation as a feature on top of your own SaaS. \r\n\nFocus on your business logic for all kind of flows, Windmill is the platform to build, share and run them.",

The platform offers a clear DX for code editing, permission management and error handling.\\n![Romaric Philogène⟨139⟩](https://windmill.dev/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/romaricphilogene/>)Romaric PhilogèneCo-Founder & CEO @ Qovery⟨140⟩![Qovery⟨12⟩](https://windmill.dev/<https:/www.qovery.com> \"Qovery\")\\nCurrently, we employ 9 apps, 20 flows, and 63 scripts in our daily operations. They all serve as the foundation for essential tasks, allowing users to independently manage their activities according to their specific needs.\\n![Sindre Svendby⟨141⟩](https://windmill.dev/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/sindresvendby/>)Sindre SvendbySoftware Engineer @ Motimate - a Kahoot! company⟨142⟩![Motimate - a Kahoot! company⟨11⟩](https://windmill.dev/<https:/motimateapp.com> \"Motimate - a Kahoot! company\")\\nI\\'ve used Retool, Argo, Airflow, etc., and nothing comes close to Windmill. It\\'s coherent and expertly designed for developers to interface with non-technical staff. It lets our small team move super fast and cover a huge surface area in a way that\\'s maintainable, observable, and debuggable.The responsiveness and speed of the Windmill team is also unheard of among SaaS providers. Feature requests have often been implemented within a day or week, and the one or two minor bug reports we\\'ve had have always been fixed within the day or even a few hours. Tthe team has treated us as partners and co-designers, and listened to our use cases and thought with us about the best way to approach a problem.We now have 10+ apps, 15+ complex syncing schedules, and 75+ individual custom scripts and actions powered syncs between 7 different systems in daily use by dozens of organizers, and our use is expanding daily. Without Windmill, attempting this level of sophistication for a technical team of our size would not have been possible.\\n![Ben Packer⟨143⟩](https://windmill.dev/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/benpaulryanpacker/>)Ben PackerSoftware Engineer @ United Auto Workers⟨144⟩![United Auto Workers⟨145⟩](https://windmill.dev/<https:/uaw.org/> \"United Auto Workers\")\\nCommunity\\n**@windmilldev** -- super powerful tool, built by @rubenfiszel, it\\'s just insane how good it is.

This is the “just get the thing done” tool my brain has needed for my entire career. I can see it becoming a hub for all kinds of logic in my system. I’m so pleased. Thanks for making such a wonderful platform, and thanks for keeping it open source. the one time I hit a snag, you helped me out within a minute. I got a lot done tonight without even expecting to, and that’s a really cool feeling.Steve A on DiscordAugust 5th 2023⟨149⟩\\nA little late but after reading this thread I moved a airflow instance to windmill and I much much prefer **Windmill** , airflow was clunky and heavy for my simple workflow that consists of running a few python script. Also is auto ui is great to play with the arguments in, the cron ui and next start date... Also is it written in rust so much more low usage than airflow that consistently cpu picked while doing nothing.hokkos on HackerNewsNovember 27th 2023⟨150⟩\\nStumbled upon **@WindmillDev** amazing open source project exactly what I needed.

This is the “just get the thing done” tool my brain has needed for my entire career. I can see it becoming a hub for all kinds of logic in my system. I’m so pleased. Thanks for making such a wonderful platform, and thanks for keeping it open source. the one time I hit a snag, you helped me out within a minute. I got a lot done tonight without even expecting to, and that’s a really cool feeling.Steve A on DiscordAugust 5th 2023\\n⟨150⟩ https://windmill.dev/<https:/news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38432912>: A little late but after reading this thread I moved a airflow instance to windmill and I much much prefer **Windmill** , airflow was clunky and heavy for my simple workflow that consists of running a few python script. Also is auto ui is great to play with the arguments in, the cron ui and next start date... Also is it written in rust so much more low usage than airflow that consistently cpu picked while doing nothing.hokkos on HackerNewsNovember 27th 2023\\n⟨151⟩ https://windmill.dev/<https:/x.com/b_arbaretier/status/1832412643082035457>: Stumbled upon **@WindmillDev** amazing open source project exactly what I needed. Team is cracked af Kind of a super advanced Zapier/ActivePieces with huge wiggle room for custom scripts. Just the right balance@b_arbaretier on XSeptember 7th 2024\\n⟨152⟩ https://windmill.dev/<https:/news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39623203>: I migrated to **windmill.dev** a couple of weeks ago and couldn\\'t be happier. Honestly the product is simply better than Airplane. I looked at Windmill.dev a 18 months ago when I adopted Airplane, and it was less mature - but it was open source and I wish I\\'d given that more weight.jeremyjh on HackerNewsMarch 6th 2024\\n⟨153⟩ https://windmill.dev/<https:/twitter.com/moritzhaarmann/status/1731580514136469659>: played with **windmill.dev** over the weekend, and it\\'s really hitting a sweet spot for me between no-code/low-code, a fancy UI but still being powerful enough to actually replace significant amounts of code.Moritz Haarmann, former Director of Engineering at AdidasDecember 4th 2023\\n⟨154⟩ https://windmill.dev/<https:/news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38385712>: I had the same thought when it popped up on my radar a year ago. Now that I’ve been using it for a few weeks, it’s difficult to go back to the exact tools you’re naming. I didn’t realize how large of an impediment it is to move back and forth all of them.**Windmill** is the thing I never knew I needed.

  "generated_description": "**Windmill: Turning Scripts into Powerful Internal Applications**\n\nFounded in 2022 and part of Y Combinator's S22 batch, Windmill is a developer-focused open-source platform designed to streamline the creation of internal applications and workflows using minimal code. Based in Paris, France, with a small team of six, Windmill positions itself as a robust alternative to tools like Airplane and Pipedream.\n\n### **Mission and Vision**\nThe mission of Windmill is straightforward: to provide an open-source platform that facilitates the transformation of simple Python and TypeScript scripts into production-grade multi-step applications. The goal is to empower developers to build, share, and run workflows without getting bogged down by the intricacies of deployment or integration.\n\n### **Core Features**\n1. **Seamless Workflow Automation**: Users can sync scripts directly from their GitHub repositories or write them directly within Windmill. The platform automatically converts these scripts into applications and no-code modules, drastically reducing the time from coding to deployment.\n\n2. **Versatile Integration**: Windmill supports a wide array of programming languages, including Python, TypeScript, Go, PHP, Bash, and SQL. This flexibility allows developers to work in their preferred languages and easily manage complex data pipelines.\n\n3. **User-Centric Development**: The platform includes features like auto-generated UIs, webhooks, and an intuitive low-code app editor that employs drag-and-drop functionalities. This makes building complex applications accessible, even to those with limited coding experience.\n\n4. **Community Collaboration**: Leveraging the open-source model, Windmill is building an extensive library of scripts through community contributions, enhancing its capabilities across various APIs and generic tasks.\n\n5. **Self-Hosting and Scalability**: Users can deploy Windmill easily on their own infrastructure or use it as a self-hosted AWS Lambda. It's designed to scale from a single worker to a thousand, accommodating any internal service needs.\n\n### **Use Cases and Adoption**\nWindmill is already trusted by over 3,000 organizations, including notable firms like Photoroom, Kahoot, and Bloom Credit. These companies use Windmill to automate back-office tasks, manage complex ETL processes, and streamline their internal operations.\n\n### **Get Involved**\nFor developers interested in contributing to or using Windmill, they can start building their internal tools in under ten minutes. The robust documentation and community support on platforms like Discord make onboarding smoother and foster collaboration.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWindmill is not just another developer tool; it's a transformative platform that enhances productivity by bridging the gap between code and application in a seamless manner. Whether you're looking to automate workflows or build complex applications with ease, Windmill holds the potential to evolve how developers interact with their scripts.\n\nExplore more about Windmill at [windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)."
