LGBTQIA+ Connections\\nJoin a safe space where queer women, nonbinary and trans sapphics come to meet, chat and flirt, all with the goal of finding their person. \\n_**Step into the sapphic utopia of your dreams!**_ Build authentic LGBTQIA+ connections and meet your forever people. \\nCreated by and for queer folks, HER takes the guesswork out of queer and lesbian dating so you can focus on finding the one. \\n[Find My People](http://weareher.com/<https:/links.weareher.com/eGYI5cJldvb>)\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n### 15+ million active members\\nWith no

App\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\nHER was the first app to launch that exclusively focussed on the needs of queer, bisexual and lesbian dating. While there were over 40 apps for other sexualities, not a single dating app existed for LGBTQ+ women and non-binary people until there was HER. Eight years later, HER has made [over 300 million lesbian matches](http://weareher.com/<https:/weareher.com/her-reaches-300-million-matches-and-counting/>), thousands of queer marriages and hundreds of lil babies. \\n[HER](http://weareher.com/<https:/weareher.com/about/>) is the world’s largest (and most iconic) dating and community-building platform for lesbian, bisexual, queer women and gender-non-conforming icons worldwide. Whilst most heteronormative apps focus on the experience of cis men (the people those apps make their money from), **HER is designed** to focus exclusively on the**needs of queer women, non-binary and trans people.**\\nWe have features to express the unique parts of sapphic culture that mean the most to you and your identity. We have community spaces to connect with other people like you. And we create a safe space amongst other sapphics to be yourself and focus on what’s important to you while finding your partner. \\nWith **over 15 million users in more than 114 countries** , you can absolutely bet that your perfect match — or perfect matches — are only a few clicks away. So, whether you’re looking for a partner or hoping to make new friends, HER has something for you. \\n[Find My Person Today ](http://weareher.com/<https:/links.weareher.com/eGYI5cJldvb>)\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n### Let your most authentic self shine through\\n## HER’s Most Unique Features\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\nHER cares, and I mean _really_ cares.

Our queer and lesbian dating app allows you to **customize every little aspect of your dating profile** so the most authentic version of yourself can shine brightly from day one. \\nUnlike the hetero apps, HER allows you to easily add your pronouns, gender identity, sexual orientation, and a litany of other fun facts and pins to your profile that make you, well, _you!_\\nWe go a step further than just giving you the option to list your basic lifestyle, like whether you’re sober, religious, or want kids someday. We also allow you to add [Pride Pins](http://weareher.com/<https:/weareher.com/celebrating-love-with-new-pride-pins/>) to your profile so you can easily let potential matches know whether you’re QPOC, T4T, chapstick or masc lesbians, intersex, and more. You can even add things to your profile, like your love language, or include one (or a few) of our free [Political Pride Pins](http://weareher.com/<https:/weareher.com/dating-with-purpose-political-pins/>) to filter your feed according to the nitty-gritty social issues you care about the most! \\nThe best part? **All of our****core features are free** and will remain free. Like, forever. That said, if you’re ever looking to upgrade your experience and take it to the next level, HER Premium offers one-of-a-kind features like incognito mode, rewinding profiles you accidentally swiped left on, seeing everyone who’s viewed you, and unlimited swipes. \\nJoin us today and discover what awaits you on the App Store or the Play Store.\\n[Download HER ](http://weareher.com/<https:/links.weareher.com/eGYI5cJldvb>)\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n## We met on HER!\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n### Amanda & Rasheeda\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n“The moment I laid eyes on her, I knew.

\\n_**Step into the sapphic utopia of your dreams!**_ Build authentic LGBTQIA+ connections and meet your forever people. \\nCreated by and for queer folks, HER takes the guesswork out of queer and lesbian dating so you can focus on finding the one. \\nFind My People⟨24⟩\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n### 15+ million active members\\nWith no shortage of sapphic people, your perfect match awaits \\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n### 4.5 stars on the App Store\\nApple Editor’s Choice 2019 - 2023

App\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\nHER was the first app to launch that exclusively focussed on the needs of queer, bisexual and lesbian dating. While there were over 40 apps for other sexualities, not a single dating app existed for LGBTQ+ women and non-binary people until there was HER. Eight years later, HER has made over 300 million lesbian matches⟨25⟩, thousands of queer marriages and hundreds of lil babies. \\nHER⟨5⟩ is the world’s largest (and most iconic) dating and community-building platform for lesbian, bisexual, queer women and gender-non-conforming icons worldwide. Whilst most heteronormative apps focus on the experience of cis men (the people those apps make their money from), **HER is designed** to focus exclusively on the**needs of queer women, non-binary and trans people.**\\nWe have features to express the unique parts of sapphic culture that mean the most to you and your identity. We have community spaces to connect with other people like you. And we create a safe space amongst other sapphics to be yourself and focus on what’s important to you while finding your partner. \\nWith **over 15 million users in more than 114 countries** , you can absolutely bet that your perfect match — or perfect matches — are only a few clicks away. So, whether you’re looking for a partner or hoping to make new friends, HER has something for you. \\nFind My Person Today ⟨24⟩\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n### Let your most authentic self shine through\\n## HER’s Most Unique Features\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\nHER cares, and I mean _really_ cares. Our unique in-app features reflect that. Our queer and lesbian dating app allows you to **customize every little aspect of your dating profile** so the most authentic version of yourself can shine brightly from day one. \\nUnlike the hetero apps, HER allows you to easily add your pronouns, gender identity, sexual orientation, and a litany of other fun facts and pins to your profile that make you, well, _you!_\\nWe go a step further than just giving you the option to list your basic lifestyle, like whether you’re sober, religious, or want kids someday. We also allow you to add Pride Pins⟨26⟩ to your profile so you can easily let potential matches know whether you’re QPOC, T4T, chapstick or masc lesbians, intersex, and more. You can even add things to your profile, like your love language, or include one (or a few) of our free Political Pride Pins⟨27⟩ to filter your feed according to the nitty-gritty social issues you care about the most! \\nThe best part? **All of our****core features are free** and will remain free. Like, forever. That said, if you’re ever looking to upgrade your experience and take it to the next level, HER Premium offers one-of-a-kind features like incognito mode, rewinding profiles you accidentally swiped left on, seeing everyone who’s viewed you, and unlimited swipes. \\nJoin us today and discover what awaits you on the App Store or the Play Store.\\nDownload HER ⟨24⟩\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n## We met on HER!\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n### Amanda & Rasheeda\\n![](http://weareher.com/wp-content/uploads/blank.png)\\n“The moment I laid eyes on her, I knew.
