  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: SafetyWing**\n\nFounded in 2018 and based in San Francisco, SafetyWing emerged from the Y Combinator W18 batch with a compelling mission: to provide health insurance tailored for remote teams and digital nomads. The company recognizes that traditional national welfare systems often fall short for the modern workforce, especially those embracing remote work lifestyles. \n\nSafetyWing is on a mission to build a global social safety net that caters to the unique needs of remote workers, a group that continues to expand around the globe. They aim to eliminate geographical barriers in access to health coverage, promoting equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of where they choose to live or work. \n\n**What They Offer**\n\nSafetyWing offers two primary products:\n\n1. **Nomad Insurance**: This is global travel medical insurance designed specifically for nomads and remote workers. It provides essential or comprehensive health coverage for individuals travelling abroad, addressing medical needs when away from home.\n\n2. **Remote Health**: A holistic health insurance solution for companies with remote team members and contractors. This single group policy covers staff in over 175 countries, making it simpler for organizations to provide healthcare to a dispersed workforce.\n\n**The Team & Culture**\n\nWith about 130 employees who are fully remote and distributed across six continents, SafetyWing embodies the principles it champions. This team model not only aligns with their mission but also enriches the products they develop, ensuring they remain relevant to a diverse global audience.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nSafetyWing is redefining how we think about health coverage in a world that increasingly values flexibility, mobility, and remote work. Their innovative approach to forming a social safety net for a global workforce is not just timely—it's essential. They look to bridge the gaps that traditional systems have left wide open, enabling individuals and companies to thrive, no matter where they are on the map.\n\nYou can explore more about their offerings on their website: [SafetyWing](http://www.safetywing.com)."
