  "generated_description": "### Remind: A Communication Revolution for Education\n\nFounded in 2011 and located in the vibrant tech hub of San Francisco, **Remind** started as an innovative communication platform aimed at helping students thrive. With a team of 51 dedicated employees, Remind has become a go-to tool for educators, school administrators, and families across the United States.\n\nThe essence of Remind's mission is simple: to foster meaningful communication and engagement in education. It delivers services that really matter to schools, allowing seamless connections between educators and families. With over **30 million users across 80% of U.S. schools**, it’s clear that their approach resonates. \n\n#### Key Offerings\n\n1. **Chat**: A free, two-way messaging service tailored for the classroom. It enables real-time communication that can even be translated into 90+ languages, ensuring that every stakeholder feels included and informed.\n\n2. **Hub**: This tool enhances organizational communication from classrooms to the district office, making it easier for administrators to connect with students and families.
