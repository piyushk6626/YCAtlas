Our mission is to help prepare kids for success in the 21st century by making programming education accessible to everyone.\r\n\nWe make awesome games that not only teach kids about programming, but help develop soft skills like grit, perseverance, and problem solving. Kids journey through the Smeeborgian Universe with a family of furry aliens and learn about programming logic, JavaScript, and game design. Kodable also includes a curriculum for elementary school teachers so they can feel confident teaching along side the game. \r\n\nKodable is already used in over 50% of US schools, and in over 190 countries. Help us continue our mission and expose millions more kids to the wonderful world of computer science!",

  "generated_description": "**Kodable Education Overview**\n\nFounded in 2013 and based in San Diego, California, Kodable Education is on a mission to fill the significant gap in coding education for kids globally—currently impacting over 250 million children. Their mantra? Teach kids to code before they can read. This pitch isn't just noble; it's practical. In an increasingly tech-driven world, early exposure to programming equips children with essential skills to thrive in the 21st century.\n\n**What They Do:**\n\nKodable crafts engaging educational games designed for children, leveraging an interactive universe populated by quirky extraterrestrials called Smeeborgs. Through play, kids learn coding fundamentals, problem-solving techniques, and important soft skills like grit and perseverance.
