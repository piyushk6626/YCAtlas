  "generated_description": "### SoloSuit: Empowering Consumers in Legal Disputes\n\n**Introduction**  \nSoloSuit is on a mission to turn everyday people into superhumans by equipping them with the necessary tools to win disputes. Founded in 2018 and a proud member of Y Combinator's W21 batch, SoloSuit takes on the daunting world of debt collection lawsuits, aiming to disrupt the $3.5 billion consumer litigation market.\n\n**Headquarters and Team**  \nSituated in Provo, Utah, SoloSuit operates with a tight-knit team of six employees. At the helm is Group Partner Dalton Caldwell, guiding the vision of this innovative legal tech company.\n\n**What They Do**  \nOriginally branded just as SoloSuit, the company provides services that demystify the process of resolving debt disputes. Their primary offerings include:\n\n- **Debt Answer**: This service helps individuals respond to debt lawsuits efficiently. SoloSuit prepares a legal response, gets it reviewed by an attorney, and files it on behalf of the consumer within the critical 14-30 day window after receiving a complaint.\n  \n- **SoloSettle**: An alternative that focuses on negotiating settlements outside of court. It helps users settle debts for less than the owed amount, which can be a realistic and less stressful solution compared to litigation.\n\n**Impressive Reach**  \nSince its inception, SoloSuit has made significant strides. The company reports having protected $1.8 billion worth of debt and assisting over 274,000 people across all 50 states. \n\n**Recognition**  \nSoloSuit has garnered attention from major media outlets, including NPR, TechCrunch, and Bloomberg, recognizing its innovative approach to a traditionally intimidating area of consumer law. \n\n**Conclusion**  \nIn a landscape where debt collection can easily feel overwhelming, SoloSuit stands out as a beacon of empowerment, enabling individuals to take control of their financial disputes with confidence. For anyone facing debt lawsuits or looking to settle debts, SoloSuit is more than just a service—it's a partner in achieving a fair resolution.\n\nTo learn more, visit [SoloSuit.com](https://www.solosuit.com)."
