You do a few prep steps (like adding a sauce or seasoning to taste), and then scan a QR code with Tovala\\'s smart oven to cook it perfectly in around 20 minutes or less with a chef perfected, automated cook cycle. Other meal kits offer meals that are already cooked and reheated in a microwave, which affects the meal\\'s flavors and texture. Or, they take 30 minutes or more to prepare and require you to do all the guesswork of cooking. Not only do Tovala Meals save on time, and limit post-mealtime clean up, but the results taste like the best kind of home cooking, full of tender veggies, juicy proteins, and melty cheese.\\n  * What are the Tovala Meal Plan options?\\nTovala offers flexible meal plans with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 16 meals per week.\\n  * How much do Tovala Meals Cost?\\nMeals start as low as $9.99 per serving and are generally $12.99 per meal. Some meals are priced higher or lower based on their ingredients, packaging needs, and number of meal components. The smallest meal plan we offer is 4 meals weekly ($51.96 plus tax). Shipping is $10.99 for all meal deliveries.\\n  * How many people does each Tovala Meal feed?\\nMost Tovala Meals are meant to serve 1 adult, though we do offer a number of 2-serving options each week that make our meal service a great option for couples and families.\\n  * Can I cook my own food in the Tovala Smart Oven?\\nYou can use the oven to do any cooking you\\'d normally do in your conventional oven. Depending on your oven model, you can use the 5-6 different cooking modes (Steam, Air Fry, Bake, Broil, Toast, and Reheat) via the button on the oven or from within the Tovala app, cook from the app\\'s library of preset recipes, and scan hundreds of name-brand grocery products like Eggo, Amy\\'s, and Pop-Tarts.\\n  * Can I skip a week? How easy is it to cancel my meal plan?\\nOur meal plans are always flexible. The last thing we want is people getting Tovala Meals that they aren’t excited about, so it’s easy to skip a week, pause or cancel.\\n  * Do you ship to my area?\\nWe ship to all zip codes in the 48 contiguous states that we can safely deliver to. We don\\'t ship to Alaska or Hawaii at this time.\\n\\n\\nStay up to date on the latest news, exclusive promos, product updates, and more.\\n[Privacy Policy](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/my.tovala.com/legal/privacy-policy>)\\n##### Explore\\n[Smart Oven](http://www.tovala.com/</smart-ovens>)\\n[Browse weekly menu](http://www.tovala.com/</menu>)\\n[Browse our meal catalog](http://www.tovala.com/</browse-meals>)\\n[Accessories](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/shop.tovala.com>)\\n[Press](http://www.tovala.com/</press>)\\n[Reviews](http://www.tovala.com/</reviews>)\\n[How it works](http://www.tovala.com/</learn>)\\n[Gift cards](http://www.tovala.com/</gifts>)\\n##### Support\\n[Contact Us](http://www.tovala.com/</support>)\\n[Help Center](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/support.tovala.com>)\\n[FAQ](http://www.tovala.com/</faq>)\\n[Returns](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/support.tovala.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012244193-Return-Policy>)[Shipping](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/support.tovala.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009553408-Tovala-Meal-Box-Shipping-FAQ>)\\n[Get the App](http://www.tovala.com/</app-download>)\\n##### My Tovala\\n[My Account](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/my.tovala.com/account/my-orders?utm_explore=true>)\\n[Affiliate Program](http://www.tovala.com/</affiliates>)\\n[Students](http://www.tovala.com/</meal-delivery-for-students>)\\n[Seniors](http://www.tovala.com/</meal-delivery-for-seniors>)\\n[Careers](http://www.tovala.com/</join-our-team>)\\n[Order Meals Only](http://www.tovala.com/</getmeals>)\\n© 2025 Tovala | All Rights Reserved\\n[Privacy](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/my.tovala.com/legal/privacy-policy>)[Terms of Service](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/my.tovala.com/legal/terms-of-service>)\\n[California Prop 65](http://www.tovala.com/</product-warning>)\\n[California AB 1200 Disclosure](http://www.tovala.com/</AB1200>)\\n[](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/www.instagram.com/tovalafood>)[](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/www.youtube.com/c/Tovala>)[](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/twitter.com/tovalafood>)[](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/www.facebook.com/tovalafood>)\\n' markdown_with_citations='![](https://p.alocdn.com/c/zpflzzbu/a/etarget/p.gif?label=tovala)![](https://ad.ipredictive.com/d/track/event?upid=114068&url=\\\\[url\\\\]&val=\\\\[Revenue\\\\]&tn=\\\\[OrderdID\\\\]&cache_buster=1739212192622&ps=2)\\nSave now for a limited time!

Then I thought about Tovala, which I had always believed was more of a gimmick than a real meal plan until I tried it. These meals are actually delicious and beyond simple to make—all with NO cleanup!”\\nBarbara M.\\n  * “I know this sound like an exaggeration but Tovala has changed my life. As a single teacher I work hard and the last thing I want to do when I come home is shop or cook. Tovala has made the entire thing soooooo easy, and the food is genuinely good.”\\nDonna Y.\\n  * “My picky son has yet to complain which is amazing. He says they have the best chicken.”\\nDonald B.\\n\\n\\nGet started now\\n![Tovala Oven⟨25⟩]\\nFlexible plans\\nStarting at $9.99/serving\\nWe offer single and two-serving meals, most meals are single serving and cost $12.99.\\nAdjust your order size or skip weeks anytime.\\n![Tovala Oven⟨26⟩]\\n![Tovala Oven⟨27⟩]\\nFlexible plans\\nStarting at $9.99/serving\\nWe offer single and two-serving meals, most meals are single serving and cost $12.99.\\nAdjust your order size or skip weeks anytime.\\n![Tovala Oven⟨28⟩]\\n![Tovala Oven⟨29⟩]\\nLimited time\\n$299 $69 Smart Oven\\nwhen you order meals 6 times over 6 months.

You do a few prep steps (like adding a sauce or seasoning to taste), and then scan a QR code with Tovala\\'s smart oven to cook it perfectly in around 20 minutes or less with a chef perfected, automated cook cycle. Other meal kits offer meals that are already cooked and reheated in a microwave, which affects the meal\\'s flavors and texture. Or, they take 30 minutes or more to prepare and require you to do all the guesswork of cooking. Not only do Tovala Meals save on time, and limit post-mealtime clean up, but the results taste like the best kind of home cooking, full of tender veggies, juicy proteins, and melty cheese.\\n  * What are the Tovala Meal Plan options?\\nTovala offers flexible meal plans with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 16 meals per week.\\n  * How much do Tovala Meals Cost?\\nMeals start as low as $9.99 per serving and are generally $12.99 per meal. Some meals are priced higher or lower based on their ingredients, packaging needs, and number of meal components. The smallest meal plan we offer is 4 meals weekly ($51.96 plus tax). Shipping is $10.99 for all meal deliveries.\\n  * How many people does each Tovala Meal feed?\\nMost Tovala Meals are meant to serve 1 adult, though we do offer a number of 2-serving options each week that make our meal service a great option for couples and families.\\n  * Can I cook my own food in the Tovala Smart Oven?\\nYou can use the oven to do any cooking you\\'d normally do in your conventional oven. Depending on your oven model, you can use the 5-6 different cooking modes (Steam, Air Fry, Bake, Broil, Toast, and Reheat) via the button on the oven or from within the Tovala app, cook from the app\\'s library of preset recipes, and scan hundreds of name-brand grocery products like Eggo, Amy\\'s, and Pop-Tarts.\\n  * Can I skip a week? How easy is it to cancel my meal plan?\\nOur meal plans are always flexible. The last thing we want is people getting Tovala Meals that they aren’t excited about, so it’s easy to skip a week, pause or cancel.\\n  * Do you ship to my area?\\nWe ship to all zip codes in the 48 contiguous states that we can safely deliver to. We don\\'t ship to Alaska or Hawaii at this time.\\n\\n\\nStay up to date on the latest news, exclusive promos, product updates, and more.\\nPrivacy Policy⟨34⟩\\n##### Explore\\nSmart Oven⟨5⟩\\nBrowse weekly menu⟨4⟩\\nBrowse our meal catalog⟨35⟩\\nAccessories⟨36⟩\\nPress⟨37⟩\\nReviews⟨38⟩\\nHow it works⟨3⟩\\nGift cards⟨39⟩\\n##### Support\\nContact Us⟨40⟩\\nHelp Center⟨41⟩\\nFAQ⟨7⟩\\nReturns⟨42⟩Shipping⟨43⟩\\nGet the App⟨44⟩\\n##### My Tovala\\nMy Account⟨8⟩\\nAffiliate Program⟨45⟩\\nStudents⟨46⟩\\nSeniors⟨47⟩\\nCareers⟨48⟩\\nOrder Meals Only⟨49⟩\\n© 2025 Tovala | All Rights Reserved\\nPrivacy⟨34⟩Terms of Service⟨50⟩\\nCalifornia Prop 65⟨51⟩\\nCalifornia AB 1200 Disclosure⟨52⟩\\n[](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/www.instagram.com/tovalafood>)[](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/www.youtube.com/c/Tovala>)[](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/twitter.com/tovalafood>)[](http://www.tovala.com/<https:/www.facebook.com/tovalafood>)\\n' references_markdown='\\n\\n## References\\n\\n⟨1⟩ http://www.tovala.com/</checkout>: Save now for a limited time!

  "generated_description": "Tovala is shaking up the meal delivery game with a unique combination of a smart oven and a subscription meal service. Founded in 2015 and hailing from Chicago, this food-tech startup is all about making cooking easier—think gourmet meals that practically cook themselves.\n\n### What's The Deal?\nTovala pairs a smart oven with weekly deliveries of fresh, chef-crafted meals. The premise is simple: choose your meals, do a minute of prep, and let the oven take care of the rest. With a touch of a button (or a quick scan of a QR code), you can enjoy meals with no messy shopping or cleanup. The whole process typically takes under 25 minutes.\n\n### Why It's Interesting\n“Smart oven” might sound gimmicky, but Tovala has the vibe of a genuine innovation. The oven not only cooks but does so using chef-approved settings that make it easy to achieve restaurant-quality results. Each week, subscribers can choose from over 35 meals, making it easy to keep things fresh and exciting.\n\n### Who’s Behind Tovala?\nThe company is part of Y Combinator's W16 batch and has grown to a team of 375 employees under the guidance of partners like Michael Seibel. Their approach to meal kits is about inclusivity, aiming to reduce the physical and mental burden of cooking.\n\n### What's the Cost?\nTovala’s meals start at around $9.99 per serving, usually landing around $12.99 for most single serving options. The smart oven is offered at a hefty discount—as low as $69 with certain meal subscriptions, making it an accessible option for many.\n\n### Customer Love\nWith over 31 million meals delivered, it’s clear that Tovala is resonating with its audience. Users rave about the quality and convenience—many likening it to having a personal chef.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nTovala is not just a meal service; it’s a tech-savvy solution for those who want home-cooked meals without the hassle. If you’re tired of takeout but don’t want to spend hours in the kitchen, Tovala might just be the answer you're looking for. Check them out at [tovala.com](http://www.tovala.com) and see if it fits into your culinary routine."
