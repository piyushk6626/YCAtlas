  "description": "Storyboarder is a tool and a platform for anyone to create, share, and sell webcomics.\r\n\nIn East Asia, the webcomic (or digital manga) industry is an $12B market and rapidly growing to the rest of the world. Webtoon, the largest company in the space, generates $100M / month in revenue. However, their addressable market is limited by their content creators, who need know how to draw. Readers are desperate for a greater variety of stories in webcomics.\r\n\nThrough years of working with filmmakers, we’ve built extremely easy to use storyboarding software  that has 700K users. We’re democratizing visual storytelling to everyone. We’re working on the next generation that, through advances in video game interfaces, ubiquitous 3D compute, and AI, will allow anyone to easily create scenes, pose characters, to create webcomics. \r\n\nStoryboarder is backed by Y Combinator (W23), David Karp (Tumblr Founder), Andrew Kortina (Venmo Founder), and other product focused investors.",

They want to know what happens in the next episode. That is worth something. We're building our platform from the ground up so viewers can pay small amounts to storytellers to read their episodes. At scale, this will be life-changing to creators on our platform.\\nIn the future, all stories will be crafted in visual form. Bold claim? Hardly, we are almost already there.\\nWill you join us?\\nJoin Waitlist\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n### What is Storyboarder?\\nStoryboarder is a tool and a platform to create and sell webcomics.\\n### Yeah, but like, what is it really?\\nA webcomic creation tool built around a powerful 3D editor, and a platform for posting stories created with the tool. We’re developing this tool so that it handles the heavy lifting of generating compelling visuals - shot composition, background design, character creation, and speech balloon placement - letting users focus on writing their stories. These stories can be shared and sold on the platform.\\n### What are webcomics?\\nWebcomics are similar to conventional comics, but they're published digitally. The format we're focusing on was pioneered in Korea - vertical scrolling and only a single panel wide. This makes them extremely easy to read on mobile phones, where people consume most media. They are even more accessible than videos because they can be picked up and put down at any time, and don’t require audio to experience the story. Webcomics are released as episodes (50-100 panels) and take 5 to 10 minutes to experience.\\n### What is the platform to share and sell webcomics?\\nIn addition to being a place to buy, sell, and share digital comics, the Storyboarder platform will be a place for creators and readers to interact, fostering communities based around the stories they love. Readers become deeply engaged with compelling stories that they connect with on a personal level. They want to talk about their favorite characters with other fans, or speculate on what’s going to happen in the next chapter, and show their support for the author. We’re building discussion forums, fan participation features, and creator patronage as first class features of the platform.\\n### How can I make money telling stories?\\nWhen you publish a new episode in your story, your audience will be waiting for it. Your story is incredibly valuable and viewers want to support the creation of your story. Viewers who first start reading your series can read the first few episodes for free. If they’ve read those episodes, they are likely hooked. When they want to read the next episode, they have to pay a small amount (roughly $0.20), or they can wait a day to read the next episode for free. This creates an immense amount of engagement, connection and value.\\n### Are you going to charge people to use Storyboarder?\\nNo! We want everyone telling stories! As a storyteller, you are incredibly valuable to us. We want our users creating, sharing, and buying each other’s stories. We make money by taking a cut of each transaction on our platform. So it’s our business to create the best storytelling tools and experiences as possible.\\n### Won’t my stories look the same as other peoples’?\\nNo! No one will tell a story exactly the same as you. Your entire value is your unique point of view and that will be reflected in the stories you make. The platform will include an asset library and marketplace, where storytellers can post requests for specific assets for other artists to fulfill. We're doing a ton of work to make sure creators can generate unique, compelling visuals using Storyboarder. We want to avoid the clashing mix of assets you see in other 3D comic creation software\\n### People post their stories on Storyboarder. Do I HAVE to post my stories?\\nNo, of course not! We want you to feel comfortable sharing your stories with a constructive and welcoming community, but you definitely don’t have to. If you are working on something top secret, feel secure that it will stay top secret!\\n### Can you or anyone else see my stories?\\nNo. Your stories are private unless you post them.\\n### Do I own my stories I make with Storyboarder?\\nYES! When you make something you own it! It’s called implicit copyright. You’re free to do whatever you want with your stories. Want to make a movie out of your story? That’s awesome! Let us know because we want to watch it!\\n### There was a previous version of Storyboarder - what's the deal with that?\\nThe previous version of Storyboarder was a tool we built to help create storyboards. Storyboards are the most basic form of visual storytelling - a sequence of rough images used to tell a story. They're used in film, animation, and video games to previsualize sequences so that production goes as smoothly as possible. The old Storyboarder is great at what it does - it has over 700k users and was used in the production of billion-dollar movies.\\n### Why change the focus to webcomics then?\\nFilmmaking isn’t easy - few scripts ever reach production, and the majority of them that do end up losing money. Our mission is to empower storytellers, and we feel digital comics are plot rich and visually compelling in a way no other medium can match for a given amount of creator effort. We feel that focusing our efforts on webcomic creation tools is the most effective way to accomplish our mission.\\n### What’s the difference between this and the old downloadable Storyboarder? Why rebuild it?\\nThe new Storyboarder will be a seamless, accessible evolution of the old Storyboarder. It’s a web-based app, so all you’ll need to start using it is a URL. It’s redesigned to focus on ease of use and visual fidelity, while including all of the capabilities of the old Storyboarder. See the ‘Features’ section for more details.\\n### Can I use the new version of Storyboarder for things other than webcomics? Like, you know, storyboarding? 👀\\nYup! Ultimately, Storyboarder will always be a tool for telling visual stories. The difference between a digital comic and film storyboards are largely matters of presentation and formatting. We’re focusing on digital comics because we think they’re right at the sweet spot of creator effort and storytelling potential, but you can use the output of Storyboarder to make memes, storyboards, TikToks, webcomics, etc.\\n### Why episodic content?\\nEpisodes are excellent for storytelling! First, they are accessible to the viewer. A viewer knows when they start reading an episode, it will only be 5 to 10 minutes of their time. If they want to read more, they can! Episodes allow storytellers to try out ideas and create worlds without figuring out the whole story. You can just create a single episode with a rough idea and see if viewers connect with it. Furthermore, you can get ideas and improve your story based on feedback from viewers as it progresses.\\n### Okay, cool, but does my content have to be episodic?\\nNo! An ‘episode’ can be as long or as short as you want it to be - so if you want to publish a single chapter on a monthly basis, that’s fine too.\\n### What will happen to my old Storyboarder files?\\nYou can still use the old Storyboarder just as you always have. We're looking to make an importer that allows you to import your files into the new Storyboarder. We are no longer developing the old Storyboarder. We're putting all our effort into the latest evolution.\\n### Does Storyboarder use AI?\\nWe'll use any technology that helps our users tell visual stories. We're really excited about the potential of generative ML models, and we're actively evaluating several models for use in our software. Since our tool is a 3D scene editor, we're going to be able to incorporate types of models that other creative tools aren't currently exploring\\n![Storyboarder Logo](https://storyboarder.com/storyboarderlogo.svg)\\n## Let's tell great stories together.\\nCopyright © 2023 Storyboarder Inc.\\n\" markdown_with_citations=\"![Storyboarder Logo⟨1⟩]\\n# The future of storytelling is coming soon.\\nStoryboarder is a tool and platform that enables anyone to create, buy, and sell webcomics.
