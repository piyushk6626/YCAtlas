See some of their profiles[here](https://www.pathrise.com/</specialists>).\\n## Most common questions\\nYou probably have some questions — we have answers\\n### What is Pathrise?\\nPathrise is a career accelerator that works on your behalf to help you land your next job! We use proprietary tech, data-driven strategies, and one-on-one expert mentorship to provide you with resume, interview, networking, and negotiation support. Our fellows typically experience an increase in interview scores, more job offers, and even increased salaries.\\n### What are the eligibility requirements for Pathrise?\\nAt this time, Pathrise only works with job seekers who are 18 or older and eligible to work in the United States. Beyond that, we look for a commitment to improvement and a baseline level of knowledge or skills to be competitive in your field. While there is no secret formula, we are committed to working with those we feel we can help and at the end of the day, if we’re not sure we can provide you with the value you need and deserve, we may not approve your application.\\n### What are Pathrise's flexible payment options?\\nAt the end of your Free Trial, your Admissions Manager will walk you through a loan application process with one of the financing providers we work with. Pathrise offers many flexible financing options, among them Income Based Repayment loans, where we only get paid if you get placed first, and have built-in protection in case you lose your job or your income decreases. Your payment accountabilities typically begin 30-60 days after you leave the program and start getting paid in your new job.\\n\\u200d\\nThe financing provider as well as our team is always standing by if you’re dealing with extenuating circumstances or need some extra flexibility. If you’re a prospective fellow and have additional questions about the Income Based Repayment model, please reach out to info@pathrise.com. If you’re a current Trial fellow, in the full program, or recently placed, reach out to support@pathrise.com\\nGot more questions?

See some of their profileshere⟨18⟩.\\n## Most common questions\\nYou probably have some questions — we have answers\\n### What is Pathrise?\\nPathrise is a career accelerator that works on your behalf to help you land your next job! We use proprietary tech, data-driven strategies, and one-on-one expert mentorship to provide you with resume, interview, networking, and negotiation support. Our fellows typically experience an increase in interview scores, more job offers, and even increased salaries.\\n### What are the eligibility requirements for Pathrise?\\nAt this time, Pathrise only works with job seekers who are 18 or older and eligible to work in the United States. Beyond that, we look for a commitment to improvement and a baseline level of knowledge or skills to be competitive in your field. While there is no secret formula, we are committed to working with those we feel we can help and at the end of the day, if we’re not sure we can provide you with the value you need and deserve, we may not approve your application.\\n### What are Pathrise's flexible payment options?\\nAt the end of your Free Trial, your Admissions Manager will walk you through a loan application process with one of the financing providers we work with. Pathrise offers many flexible financing options, among them Income Based Repayment loans, where we only get paid if you get placed first, and have built-in protection in case you lose your job or your income decreases. Your payment accountabilities typically begin 30-60 days after you leave the program and start getting paid in your new job.\\n\\u200d\\nThe financing provider as well as our team is always standing by if you’re dealing with extenuating circumstances or need some extra flexibility. If you’re a prospective fellow and have additional questions about the Income Based Repayment model, please reach out to info@pathrise.com. If you’re a current Trial fellow, in the full program, or recently placed, reach out to support@pathrise.com\\nGot more questions?
