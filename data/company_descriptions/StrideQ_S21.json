Surprisingly, 33% of restaurant customers still prefer ordering via phone calls, but front desk staff is often busy and revenue is lost.\r\n\nAfter enabling StrideQ our customers have increased their sales by over 10%, even while dealing with staff shortages in covid times.\r\n\nPhone ordering is our wedge to become the point of sale system for all restaurants. StrideQ also streamlines dine-in and online orders in one single system. It helps to run restaurants more easily by effectively managing operations during weekend peak rush.",

  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: StrideQ**\n\nStrideQ, formerly known as SliceQ, is on a mission to revolutionize the restaurant industry with its automated phone ordering system. Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's Summer Batch S21, this tech startup operates from Mountain View, California, with a lean team of just two employees. The idea is simple yet powerful: ensure that no phone orders are missed, thus safeguarding restaurant revenue—a concern given that 33% of customers still prefer calling in their orders.\n\n### The Problem and the Solution\n\nDuring peak hours, restaurant front desks often become bottlenecks. Staff are busy handling in-person customers, which leads to missed orders and lost revenue. StrideQ addresses this by automating the phone ordering process. Customers who have implemented StrideQ have seen sales increases of over 10%, even amid staff shortages exacerbated by COVID-19.\n\nBut StrideQ isn't just about preventing missed calls; it's a wedge to becoming the central point-of-sale (POS) system for restaurants. The software seamlessly integrates dine-in and online orders, making operations more manageable, especially during busy periods.\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n1. **Increased Efficiency:** StrideQ reduces the time staff spend answering phone calls, allowing them to focus on in-person guests and other critical tasks.\n   \n2. **Boosted Revenue:** Users report a significant uptick in orders and tips—between 10-20%—as it minimizes customer wait times and captures more phone orders.\n   \n3. **Staffing Solution:** The platform can save restaurants over two hours a day previously spent on phone calls, leading to a 20-30% decrease in labor costs.\n   \n4. **AI-Powered Catering Tools:** StrideQ features custom inquiry forms and a catering management system, allowing restaurants to effectively capture and manage catering orders.\n\n5. **Effortless Onboarding:** Installation is swift—no hardware is required, and the current phone system can be retained. Onboarding takes just about 20 minutes, with no training necessary for staff.\n\n### Customer Testimonials\n\nFrancisco Rodriguez from Las Vegas Taqueria noted, “I no longer need a dedicated person to attend phone calls... now that person helps with packaging and assisting dine-in customers. StrideQ solved my hiring issues.” \n\nKaori Watanabe of Seto Restaurant shared, “With StrideQ, my revenue increased by 20%. The chaos of lunch hours is gone.”\n\n### The Bigger Picture\n\nStrideQ is aiming high. By optimizing the phone ordering process, they intend to expand their offering into a complete POS solution for restaurants. This aligns perfectly with the ongoing trend in technology where operational efficiency meets customer service excellence.\n\n### Join the Movement\n\nFor restaurants looking to simplify their operations and maximize profits without additional hiring complications, StrideQ offers a risk-free trial. Interested parties can learn more on their [website](https://strideq.com) or reach out at (650) 282-1239.\n\nIn a world where efficiency and customer experience are paramount, StrideQ is poised to be an essential tool for restaurants striving to thrive."
