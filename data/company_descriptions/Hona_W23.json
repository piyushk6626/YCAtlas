First of all, every single person in the company has been a stellar partner to us & genuinely invested in the success of our business. From our very first call, it was a seamless process. They listened to our needs, let us know how they could help, and laid out an easy timeline for implementation. Implementation required minimal effort on our end and we were up and running quickly.Initially, we planned to stagger our rollout to clients in case we had a lot of clients call in with questions. No one had a question! Clients would receive the first text & log in without any issue. We decided to roll out to our full list of clients & still no issues. We were shocked that it was so easy & that clients were so comfortable with not only the login process but the way the content was presented.Since we\\'ve partnered with Hona, the software itself has needed minimal work on our end. We\\'ve updated a few bits of content here & there. But mostly we\\'ve been able to \"set it and forget it\" because the software does what it\\'s supposed to do.We looked at other options but have never regretted selecting Hona. Their software was great when we first implemented it and has gotten even better over time. We appreciate having a partner that\\'s always working to add more features. Thank you so much to the team at Hona!\"\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657bdb51ea28797da97dfd44/66c574140346831013ba9f02_Hona%20Location%20mark%20Icon%20Dark%20\\\\(New\\\\).webp)\\n##### Discover Hona\\'s Impact\\nJoin the proactive communication revolution.

After my staff and I participated in demos with a few different companies, we were unanimous that Hona was the best option because it offered an easy-to-access, straightforward solution to our clients. Competitors tried to do too much, to be too flashy, etc. The onboarding process was seamless. Everyone I have dealt with at the company has been great to work with. No flash or sales tactics -- just approachable and straightforward. I am very happy that I went with Hona.\"\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657bdb51ea28797da97dfd44/65d8ed8e8e7be145ba55fee5_Maxwell%20Kinman%20\\\\(AWK%20Legal\\\\).jpg)\\nMaxwell Kinman\\n\"Started using their services 2 months ago. Small law firm. They have been greatly receptive to getting onboarding worked out. Incredibly pleased with the service. Clients are also enjoying the new service, and I am retaining clients at a higher rate.\"\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657bdb51ea28797da97dfd44/65d8ed8f6fe81f0d22df6365_Belinda%20Katko%20\\\\(The%20Wilson%20PC\\\\).jpg)\\nBelinda Katko\\n\"We love Hona! First of all, every single person in the company has been a stellar partner to us & genuinely invested in the success of our business. From our very first call, it was a seamless process. They listened to our needs, let us know how they could help, and laid out an easy timeline for implementation. Implementation required minimal effort on our end and we were up and running quickly.Initially, we planned to stagger our rollout to clients in case we had a lot of clients call in with questions. No one had a question! Clients would receive the first text & log in without any issue. We decided to roll out to our full list of clients & still no issues. We were shocked that it was so easy & that clients were so comfortable with not only the login process but the way the content was presented.Since we\\'ve partnered with Hona, the software itself has needed minimal work on our end. We\\'ve updated a few bits of content here & there. But mostly we\\'ve been able to \"set it and forget it\" because the software does what it\\'s supposed to do.We looked at other options but have never regretted selecting Hona. Their software was great when we first implemented it and has gotten even better over time. We appreciate having a partner that\\'s always working to add more features. Thank you so much to the team at Hona!\"\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657bdb51ea28797da97dfd44/66c574140346831013ba9f02_Hona%20Location%20mark%20Icon%20Dark%20\\\\(New\\\\).webp)\\n##### Discover Hona\\'s Impact\\nJoin the proactive communication revolution.
