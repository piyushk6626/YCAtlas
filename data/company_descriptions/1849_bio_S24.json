  "description": "1849 bio designs microbes enabling cheap metal extraction allowing miners to unlock value from low quality copper and gold ores. Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. \r\n\nUnfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can’t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.\r\n\nWhile a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. \r\n\nTo change that, we’re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes.\r\n\nWe’re world class microbial engineers. We met while doing our PhDs in synthetic biology, where we spent our time applying and developing the most advanced bioengineering technologies to engineer living cells.",

  "generated_description": "**1849 Bio: Unlocking Metal Value with Microbial Engineering**\n\nFounded in 2024 and based in San Francisco, 1849 Bio is an ambitious biotech start-up that's tackling a dramatic gap in the metals market. With the electrification wave driving a surge in demand for key metals like copper, there’s an expectation of a 20% supply shortfall in the next few years. This is where 1849 Bio steps in with a mission: engineering microbes that help miners extract valuable metals from low-quality ores, thereby unlocking billions of dollars in trapped resources. \n\nAt present, conventional mining processes for metals come with hefty price tags—running about $7 per ton of ore. Biomining, however, operates at approximately $1 per ton. The catch? Biomining techniques can only apply to about 20% of copper ores, leaving an estimated $800 billion worth of copper stranded in waste materials due to unprofitable extraction methods. This is a gold mine of a problem, and it presents a significant opportunity.\n\nWhile there has been intensive work on refining the mining processes, the microbes themselves have largely been overlooked. That’s where 1849 Bio’s expertise comes into play. The team's founders—Jai Padmakumar, Yongjin Park, and Nicholas DeLateur—are world-class microbial engineers who met during their PhDs in synthetic biology. They are uniquely positioned to change the game by developing custom engineered microbes that improve the efficiency of biomining.\n\nWith the backing of Y Combinator (Batch S24) and a small but focused team of three employees, 1849 Bio is not only committed to innovation in metal extraction but is also aiming to do so in an environmentally friendly way. It's a blend of hard-tech, synthetic biology, and climate consciousness, all while redefining what it means to do mining sustainably.\n\nIn summary, 1849 Bio is working on transforming the mining landscape with biotech advancements, paving the way for a more efficient and eco-friendly means of extracting key metals, all while addressing the looming supply issues that electrification is bringing to the forefront.
