She’s currently in secondary school, having just completed Form 2, and she excitedly looks forward to joining Form 3 next year. While her older sister pursues her dreams at hairdressing college and doing her best to support the family with her limited income, Valentine has been working hard in school, hoping to create a better future for her family. Their parents are small-scale farmers, working tirelessly on a tiny 1-acre plot of land. They grow vegetables and tend to mango trees, while Valentine’s father supplements their income by operating a motorcycle taxi. Despite their best efforts, it’s a daily struggle to meet the basic needs of all their children, each of whom is in school. Recently, Valentine faced an unexpected crisis. While riding as a passenger on a motorcycle, an accident led to a serious injury, fracturing her leg. In severe pain and unable to walk, she was taken to a nearby facility where doctors confirmed the injury. Valentine was then referred to our medical partner\\'s care center, AIC Kapsowar Hospital. Upon her arrival, the hospital team worked quickly to manage her pain and stabilize her leg. However, the expenses involved in her treatment, particularly the necessary surgery to repair her fracture, are beyond her family\\'s reach. Her parents are unable to afford medical insurance and are struggling to keep up with the costs. Fortunately, surgeons at our medical partner can help. On November 28th, Valentine will undergo a fracture repair procedure called an open reduction and internal fixation, that will hopefully restore her mobility. Now, Valentine\\'s family needs help to fund this $861 procedure. Valentine says, \"I never imagined I would end up in the hospital during my school holidays. Now, I can’t walk on my own, and I hope to get better before school reopens in January.\" 37%funded$325raised$536to go](https://watsi.org/</profile/ba94a87a5718-valentine>)\\n[Titus is a joyful and playful six-year-old boy from Kenya. He is the only child in his family and lives with his single mother who works in a hair salon. Titus is in grade 2 and enjoys reading. At home, he loves to play. Titus was born with a clubfoot on his left foot, where his foot is twisted out of shape. This causes difficulty walking and even wearing shoes. At just seven days old, Titus began serial casting to correct his foot. Each cast was changed weekly, and after the casting phase, he was given a brace to maintain the correction. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties, his mother could not afford the transport to take him to his regular follow-up appointments. As a result, his condition worsened and Titus began to limp when walking. Fortunately, our medical partner, African Mission Healthcare, can help. Surgeons will perform clubfoot repair surgery on October 28th and Titus needs $1,286 to fund the procedure and care. After treatment, he will be able to walk, run, and play more comfortably. It will allow him to continue his studies and boost his self-esteem. “I am looking forward to seeing him walking just like other children,” Titus’s mother shared.44%funded$573raised$713to go](https://watsi.org/</profile/9304aa5fec41-titus>)\\n[Eithan is a five-year-old boy from Bolivia. He lives in the western part of Bolivia in a subtropical area with his mother and younger brother. His mother is an agricultural worker. Ethan enjoys playing with his younger brother. Eithan has Shone\\'s syndrome, a condition that includes having a mitral valve that is too narrow as well as a narrowing of the aorta. These cause blood to back up in his heart and lead to heart failure. On November 20th, Eithan will undergo cardiac surgery at our medical partner\\'s care center, Hospital del Niño Dr. Ovidio Aliaga Uría. During surgery, Surgeons will correct these conditions by opening the passages to the right size. Eithan\\'s family needs help to fund the costs of cardiac care and surgery. Our medical partner, International Cardiac Alliance, is requesting $1,500 to cover the cost of cardiac exams and diagnostics, surgical costs, follow-up care, and medications.

He lives in the western part of Bolivia in a subtropical area with his mother and younger brother. His mother is an agricultural worker. Ethan enjoys playing with his younger brother. Eithan has Shone\\'s syndrome, a condition that includes having a mitral valve that is too narrow as well as a narrowing of the aorta. These cause blood to back up in his heart and lead to heart failure. On November 20th, Eithan will undergo cardiac surgery at our medical partner\\'s care center, Hospital del Niño Dr. Ovidio Aliaga Uría. During surgery, Surgeons will correct these conditions by opening the passages to the right size. Eithan\\'s family needs help to fund the costs of cardiac care and surgery. Our medical partner, International Cardiac Alliance, is requesting $1,500 to cover the cost of cardiac exams and diagnostics, surgical costs, follow-up care, and medications. Eithan\\'s mother said, \"I cannot sleep thinking about my son\\'s condition. That is the only thing that I could think of and now he will have his surgery.

  "generated_description": "Watsi is an innovative non-profit organization that launched in 2011 and is recognized as the first global crowdfunding platform specifically for medical care. Founded out of Y Combinator's W13 batch, Watsi operates from San Francisco with a lean team of just 11 dedicated individuals. Their mission is simple yet powerful: to leverage technology to provide universal healthcare funding through direct costs for surgeries and primary care.\n\nThe way Watsi works is straightforward: anyone can fund a patient’s healthcare needs, with 100% of donations going directly to the surgeries. This approach not only helps patients get the care they need but also allows donors to see the real impact of their contributions. You can choose to make a one-time donation, start a monthly subscription to consistently support new patients, or even launch your own fundraising campaign.\n\nOne striking aspect of Watsi is the transparency it offers; donors receive updates after the treatments, meaning that you can witness firsthand the difference your support makes in someone's life. Patients like Valentine from Kenya, who suffered a motorcycle accident and needs surgery to repair her leg, rely on this platform. Her story is one of many; Watsi has successfully funded over 30,000 surgeries through their community of more than 31,000 donors.\n\nBy emphasizing grassroots funding, Watsi is redefining how we think about healthcare access in underserved regions worldwide. They believe that everyone, regardless of background or location, deserves access to medical care. If you want to be part of this change, you can visit them at [Watsi.org](https://watsi.org).\n\nIn summary, Watsi is not just a crowdfunding site; it’s a lifeline for many people facing medical crises. Their commitment to healthcare equity and donor transparency makes them a standout in the crowded non-profit space. Want to help? Check out their site, meet a patient, and consider making a donation. Your small act can lead to profound change."
