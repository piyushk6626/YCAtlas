  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Edge**\n\nFounded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's Batch W23, Edge is revolutionizing the patent process for professionals like patent attorneys, agents, and inventors. Their mission is clear: to serve as the ultimate patent assistant, leveraging cutting-edge AI and cloud technologies to simplify and expedite patent drafting and management. With a lean team of only two, based in an unspecified location, Edge is small but packed with potential.\n\n**What Edge Does**\n\nEdge’s toolset focuses on four core functionalities:\n\n1. **Drafting**: Users can draft and edit patent applications more efficiently, minimizing the lengthy manual process traditionally involved.\n   \n2. **Figures**: The platform includes a specialized figure editor that allows professionals to create and manipulate visual content effortlessly, enhancing patent applications visually and functionally.\n\n3. **Disclosure**: Edge helps users intake disclosures directly from inventors quickly, utilizing AI to transform this process into a minute affair rather than a drawn-out one.\n\n4. **Workflows**: Automated workflows streamline patent management, enabling users to manage templates and organize drafts efficiently.\n\n**Security Concerns Addressed**\n\nIn today's data-sensitive environment, Edge prioritizes security with SOC 2 Type II certification, encryption, and strict data handling policies. They promise not to train their AI on user data, which is a significant relief for any organization concerned about confidentiality.\n\n**Why Edge Matters**\n\nFor busy patent professionals, Edge isn't just a software tool; it’s a means of reclaiming valuable time and resources. By reducing hours of tedious drafting work to mere seconds, Edge is reshaping how patents are made. \n\nFor those looking to navigate the patent world with less pain and more efficiency, Edge appears ready to make a lasting impact. \n\nIf you want to learn more or see the platform in action, visit their website at [withedge.com](https://withedge.com)."
