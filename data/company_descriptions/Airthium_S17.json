  "description": "We build engines that have the potential to slash 33% or worldwide CO2 emissions - cost-effectively.\r\n\nFirst, we help food and mining companies cut both their heat costs *and* CO2 emissions by replacing gas-fired steam boilers with our proprietary high temperature heat pumps. Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000°F.\r\n\nOnce the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.\r\n\nThe first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.\r\n\nOur key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.\r\n\nPlease see Airthium's website for more information.",

Heat pumps work by redirecting the flow of thermal energy (”heat”) from cold matter to hot matter, similar to how a fridge works.

  "generated_description": "### Airthium: Decarbonizing Heat and Power\n\n**Overview**  \nFounded in 2016 and based in Paris, France, Airthium is on a mission to provide decarbonized heat and power solutions that are cheaper than fossil fuels. The company, which was part of the Y Combinator Batch S17, aims to tackle a staggering portion of global CO2 emissions—33%—by revolutionizing thermal energy generation.\n\n**The Innovation**  \nAt its core, Airthium is building advanced heat pumps capable of delivering high-temperature energy. These machines not only cut costs but also significantly decrease CO2 emissions in industries that typically rely on gas-fired steam boilers. The proprietary technology allows Airthium's heat pumps to produce up to three times the amount of heat using the same electricity compared to conventional systems, even at temperatures reaching 1000°F.\n\n### Key Markets  \nAirthium is initially focusing on high-margin opportunities in the industrial sector, addressing over 20% of worldwide CO2 emissions associated with heating. The longer-term vision includes developing seasonal energy storage to complement solar and wind, aiming to replace conventional batteries and fossil-fired power plants—eventually tackling a market that represents 30% of global CO2 emissions.\n\n### Longevity and Efficiency  \nThe foundation of Airthium's technology lies in an advanced Stirling engine that boasts efficiencies of up to 86% of the Carnot limit—significantly surpassing the 64% efficiency of current state-of-the-art systems. This innovation translates into lower costs and increased reliability, setting the stage for wide adoption across various industries, including food, automotive, and mining.\n\n### The Team  \nWith a compact team of 12 dedicated employees, Airthium is driven by a vision to make polluting alternatives more expensive than clean, sustainable solutions. They believe the technological innovations they are creating might be crucial for tackling climate change at scale.\n\n### Conclusion  \nIn a world grappling with climate challenges, Airthium’s focus on engineering low-cost, sustainable heat is both timely and ambitious. By leveraging high-efficiency technologies and a strategic market approach, they aim to change how industries power themselves while contributing to the global fight against climate change.\n\nFor more information, visit [Airthium's website](http://www.airthium.com)."
