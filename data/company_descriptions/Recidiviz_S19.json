  "description": "Recidiviz is a non-profit technology company that drives meaningful changes in criminal justice systems and improved outcomes for justice-impacted individuals.\r\n\nCriminal justice data today is inefficient and ineffective: researchers, advocates, policymakers and practitioners each need funding and time for data collection and cleaning (for almost any data at all), and most data collected is too stale by the time it’s compiled to be useful.\r\n\nRecidiviz has built an open-source platform to ingest data from across data silos, link it, standardize it, and expose it in usable formats to the ecosystem. We provide products and analyses on top of this platform to help government agencies understand how their justice systems are functioning, set and track progress towards goals, drive evidence-based improvements to practice and policy, and ensure justice-impacted folks reenter their communities as safely and quickly as they can.",

  "generated_description": "**Recidiviz: A Tech-Driven Approach to Criminal Justice Reform**\n\n**Mission:** Recidiviz is on a mission to create a smaller, fairer, safer justice system. Founded in 2019 as a non-profit tech organization, it's aimed at driving meaningful changes in criminal justice systems and improving outcomes for those affected by these systems.\n\n**The Problem:** The state of criminal justice data is largely inefficient. Many stakeholders—like researchers, advocates, and policymakers—struggle with obtaining timely and relevant data, often spending an unreasonable amount of time and resources on data cleanup. By the time they’ve gathered information, it's typically outdated and thus less useful.\n\n**The Solution:** Recidiviz has developed an open-source platform that pulls together fragmented criminal justice data, links it, standardizes it, and makes it accessible for analysis. This platform enables government agencies to gain real-time insights into their justice systems, set goals, track progress, and make informed, evidence-based improvements to policies and practices. Their ultimate aim? To help individuals reenter their communities safely and swiftly.\n\n**Team and Operations:** Based in New York, Recidiviz operates with a dedicated team of 80 employees. The organization notably participated in Y Combinator’s S19 batch, gaining invaluable mentorship and resources as it launched its operations.\n\n**Current Focus:** Recidiviz is working on several fronts:\n1. Integrating disjointed data from criminal justice agencies.\n2. Offering tools for decision-makers at every level.\n3. Improving outcomes for individuals impacted by the justice system.\n\nThey emphasize a human-centered definition of success, prioritizing the experiences of those affected by the justice system in their approach to restoring equity and facilitating successful reintegration into society.\n\n**Community Engagement:** Through partnerships with state agencies, Recidiviz focuses on fostering collaboration and improving data transparency between sectors. They empower correctional leaders, line staff, and the public by providing access to actionable data visualizations and tools.\n\n**Impact:** Having partnered with states like Idaho, Missouri, Maine, and Tennessee, Recidiviz is recognized for significantly impacting how criminal justice systems operate, underscoring the importance of data in driving systemic change. \n\nIn essence, Recidiviz is harnessing technology to cut through bureaucratic inefficiencies, democratizing access to vital data in the pursuit of a just society. Every person who successfully transitions back into the community, as Recidiviz points out, is a step toward a better society. \n\nFor more information, visit [Recidiviz's official website](https://www.recidiviz.org/)."
