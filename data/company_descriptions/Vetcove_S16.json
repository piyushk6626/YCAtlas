Once you add your vendor account to Vetcove, your special pricing with that vendor will automatically be reflected on Vetcove. You\u2019ll still qualify for all rebates, promotions, and loyalty programs with your vendors, too! \\n### Is Vetcove a distributor? Is it a buying group?\\n**Vetcove is neither a distributor, nor a buying group.** We don\u2019t buy and resell products, and we don\u2019t negotiate deals on behalf of our members. Vetcove is a purchasing platform that helps clinics order smarter and easier from the suppliers they already use. You still qualify for all vendor promotions and rebates, and there are some additional Vetcove-exclusive deals too to help you save even more. \\n### Why is Vetcove free?\\n**Corporations pay, so that independently-owned veterinary practices don\u2019t have to.** Vetcove provides rich content listings, payment processing, and order management capabilities to manufacturers that sell direct on Vetcove.

The pricing you see on each vendor\u2019s website is specific to your practice, depending on whether you\u2019re a part of a GPO or corporate consolidator, or have negotiated a particular pricing tier with your rep. By adding your supplier accounts, Vetcove can display your clinic\u2019s own unique prices and local stock information while you shop, and allows you to place orders with your vendors through Vetcove. \\n## [ See how Vetcove works  From price comparison to order management, Vetcove makes ordering a breeze.

You\u2019ll be able to see which vendor accounts you can add once you sign up. If you have questions, email us at support@vetcove.com, or chat with us using the chat bubble at the bottom-right of our website. \\n### Will I still get my negotiated, GPO, or corporate pricing?\\n**Vetcove fully supports all special pricing** , including buying group deals, corporate group negotiated deals, and special pricing provided by your representatives. Once you add your vendor account to Vetcove, your special pricing with that vendor will automatically be reflected on Vetcove. You\u2019ll still qualify for all rebates, promotions, and loyalty programs with your vendors, too! \\n### Is Vetcove a distributor? Is it a buying group?\\n**Vetcove is neither a distributor, nor a buying group.** We don\u2019t buy and resell products, and we don\u2019t negotiate deals on behalf of our members. Vetcove is a purchasing platform that helps clinics order smarter and easier from the suppliers they already use. You still qualify for all vendor promotions and rebates, and there are some additional Vetcove-exclusive deals too to help you save even more. \\n### Why is Vetcove free?\\n**Corporations pay, so that independently-owned veterinary practices don\u2019t have to.** Vetcove provides rich content listings, payment processing, and order management capabilities to manufacturers that sell direct on Vetcove.

When you use Vetcove, the only thing that really changes is your purchasing experience\u2013which becomes a whole lot better! \\n### Do I have to add my vendor accounts to use Vetcove?\\n**Yes, you must add your vendor accounts to use Vetcove.** Suppliers charge different prices to each clinic, even for the exact same items. The pricing you see on each vendor\u2019s website is specific to your practice, depending on whether you\u2019re a part of a GPO or corporate consolidator, or have negotiated a particular pricing tier with your rep. By adding your supplier accounts, Vetcove can display your clinic\u2019s own unique prices and local stock information while you shop, and allows you to place orders with your vendors through Vetcove. \\n##  See how Vetcove works  From price comparison to order management, Vetcove makes ordering a breeze.

    "generated_description": "**Vetcove: Revolutionizing Veterinary Supply Chain Management**\n\nFounded in 2015 and part of Y Combinator\u2019s Batch S16, Vetcove is based in Miami, FL, and has quickly established itself as a crucial player in the veterinary supply landscape. Their mission? To power the animal health supply chain for a community of over 18,000 veterinary hospitals that service millions of animals across the United States.\n\nVetcove began as a simple idea: to streamline how veterinarians purchase the supplies essential for keeping pets healthy. As of 2022, they are now the go-to purchasing platform for approximately half of the country\u2019s veterinary clinics, including general practices, specialty and emergency clinics, SPCAs, and even zoos and aquariums. The company employs a team of around 83 individuals, all devoted to improving veterinary supply efficiency.\n\n**What Does Vetcove Offer?**\n\nVetcove's eCommerce and mobile platforms are designed to eliminate the friction traditionally associated with veterinary supply ordering. It significantly reduces the time practitioners spend comparing prices from various suppliers. Instead of juggling multiple websites, veterinarians can access one integrated platform where they can quickly browse products, compare prices in real-time, manage inventories, and even have medications delivered directly to pet owners' doorsteps. \n\nThe beauty here lies in its simplicity and efficacy\u2014this allows veterinary clinics to focus more on what they do best: providing care to animals, rather than getting lost in purchasing logistics.\n\n**Why Is It Free?**\n\nA key aspect of Vetcove\u2019s business model is that it\u2019s completely free for veterinary clinics. This financial structure is supported by partnerships with corporations that utilize Vetcove\u2019s data and analytics services, essentially letting independent practices access a sophisticated purchasing platform without any costs.\n\n**Growing Community and Feedback**\n\nWith over 19,000 veterinary hospitals using Vetcove regularly, the feedback from the community has been overwhelmingly positive. Users appreciate the time savings, ease of price comparison, and a plethora of other features that improve ordering efficiency. Many have remarked how Vetcove has transformed their procurement processes from tedious and time-consuming to quick and enjoyable.\n\n**Join the Vetcove Movement**\n\nIf you\u2019re involved in veterinary care and are tired of the cumbersome ordering processes that detract from your practice, Vetcove might just be the tool you didn\u2019t know you needed. They\u2019re actively hiring, which speaks volumes about their growth potential and commitment to revolutionizing veterinary supplies.\n\nFor more details or to get started, visit their website at [Vetcove](https://www.vetcove.com).
