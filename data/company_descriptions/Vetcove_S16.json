You’ll be able to see which vendor accounts you can add once you sign up. If you have questions, email us at support@vetcove.com, or chat with us using the chat bubble at the bottom-right of our website. \\n### Will I still get my negotiated, GPO, or corporate pricing?\\n**Vetcove fully supports all special pricing** , including buying group deals, corporate group negotiated deals, and special pricing provided by your representatives. Once you add your vendor account to Vetcove, your special pricing with that vendor will automatically be reflected on Vetcove. You’ll still qualify for all rebates, promotions, and loyalty programs with your vendors, too! \\n### Is Vetcove a distributor? Is it a buying group?\\n**Vetcove is neither a distributor, nor a buying group.** We don’t buy and resell products, and we don’t negotiate deals on behalf of our members. Vetcove is a purchasing platform that helps clinics order smarter and easier from the suppliers they already use. You still qualify for all vendor promotions and rebates, and there are some additional Vetcove-exclusive deals too to help you save even more. \\n### Why is Vetcove free?\\n**Corporations pay, so that independently-owned veterinary practices don’t have to.** Vetcove provides rich content listings, payment processing, and order management capabilities to manufacturers that sell direct on Vetcove. Vetcove will never charge veterinary organizations to use Vetcove. Read more about [Why It’s Free](https://www.vetcove.com/</why-is-it-free/>) and [Vetcove’s commitment to veterinarians](https://www.vetcove.com/</about/>). \\n### Do I have to change who I order from?\\n**Of course not! You keep your suppliers and relationships** Vetcove is a purchasing tool that brings all of your existing vendors into one platform to make purchasing faster and easier. You still order from the vendors you know and trust, with the same pricing, shipping, billing, and support you’re used to. Your representatives will still receive their commissions, and your relationships with them will not be impacted at all. When you use Vetcove, the only thing that really changes is your purchasing experience–which becomes a whole lot better! \\n### Do I have to add my vendor accounts to use Vetcove?\\n**Yes, you must add your vendor accounts to use Vetcove.** Suppliers charge different prices to each clinic, even for the exact same items. The pricing you see on each vendor’s website is specific to your practice, depending on whether you’re a part of a GPO or corporate consolidator, or have negotiated a particular pricing tier with your rep. By adding your supplier accounts, Vetcove can display your clinic’s own unique prices and local stock information while you shop, and allows you to place orders with your vendors through Vetcove. \\n## [ See how Vetcove works  From price comparison to order management, Vetcove makes ordering a breeze.

You’ll be able to see which vendor accounts you can add once you sign up. If you have questions, email us at support@vetcove.com, or chat with us using the chat bubble at the bottom-right of our website. \\n### Will I still get my negotiated, GPO, or corporate pricing?\\n**Vetcove fully supports all special pricing** , including buying group deals, corporate group negotiated deals, and special pricing provided by your representatives. Once you add your vendor account to Vetcove, your special pricing with that vendor will automatically be reflected on Vetcove. You’ll still qualify for all rebates, promotions, and loyalty programs with your vendors, too! \\n### Is Vetcove a distributor? Is it a buying group?\\n**Vetcove is neither a distributor, nor a buying group.** We don’t buy and resell products, and we don’t negotiate deals on behalf of our members. Vetcove is a purchasing platform that helps clinics order smarter and easier from the suppliers they already use. You still qualify for all vendor promotions and rebates, and there are some additional Vetcove-exclusive deals too to help you save even more. \\n### Why is Vetcove free?\\n**Corporations pay, so that independently-owned veterinary practices don’t have to.** Vetcove provides rich content listings, payment processing, and order management capabilities to manufacturers that sell direct on Vetcove. Vetcove will never charge veterinary organizations to use Vetcove. Read more about Why It’s Free⟨6⟩ and Vetcove’s commitment to veterinarians⟨13⟩. \\n### Do I have to change who I order from?\\n**Of course not! You keep your suppliers and relationships** Vetcove is a purchasing tool that brings all of your existing vendors into one platform to make purchasing faster and easier. You still order from the vendors you know and trust, with the same pricing, shipping, billing, and support you’re used to. Your representatives will still receive their commissions, and your relationships with them will not be impacted at all. When you use Vetcove, the only thing that really changes is your purchasing experience–which becomes a whole lot better! \\n### Do I have to add my vendor accounts to use Vetcove?\\n**Yes, you must add your vendor accounts to use Vetcove.** Suppliers charge different prices to each clinic, even for the exact same items. The pricing you see on each vendor’s website is specific to your practice, depending on whether you’re a part of a GPO or corporate consolidator, or have negotiated a particular pricing tier with your rep. By adding your supplier accounts, Vetcove can display your clinic’s own unique prices and local stock information while you shop, and allows you to place orders with your vendors through Vetcove. \\n##  See how Vetcove works  From price comparison to order management, Vetcove makes ordering a breeze.

Their mission? To power the animal health supply chain for a community of over 18,000 veterinary hospitals that service millions of animals across the United States.\n\nVetcove began as a simple idea: to streamline how veterinarians purchase the supplies essential for keeping pets healthy. As of 2022, they are now the go-to purchasing platform for approximately half of the country’s veterinary clinics, including general practices, specialty and emergency clinics, SPCAs, and even zoos and aquariums. The company employs a team of around 83 individuals, all devoted to improving veterinary supply efficiency.\n\n**What Does Vetcove Offer?**\n\nVetcove's eCommerce and mobile platforms are designed to eliminate the friction traditionally associated with veterinary supply ordering.

Instead of juggling multiple websites, veterinarians can access one integrated platform where they can quickly browse products, compare prices in real-time, manage inventories, and even have medications delivered directly to pet owners' doorsteps. \n\nThe beauty here lies in its simplicity and efficacy—this allows veterinary clinics to focus more on what they do best: providing care to animals, rather than getting lost in purchasing logistics.\n\n**Why Is It Free?**\n\nA key aspect of Vetcove’s business model is that it’s completely free for veterinary clinics. This financial structure is supported by partnerships with corporations that utilize Vetcove’s data and analytics services, essentially letting independent practices access a sophisticated purchasing platform without any costs.\n\n**Growing Community and Feedback**\n\nWith over 19,000 veterinary hospitals using Vetcove regularly, the feedback from the community has been overwhelmingly positive.
