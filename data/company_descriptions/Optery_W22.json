You are helping lives and giving identity back to the rightful owner. Bless you for your work and your service to the people. I wish more people could afford it or knew more about this work and your organization. It took me a while to know what to even look for, that led me down the path of finding your service for clean up on aisle \"theft\". YOUR cyber security work, to clean up identity fraud and compromised Cyber Security for people is greatly needed. The mess of fraud and scams to reclaim is tiresome for people. Thank you for taking over. I am exhausted and FTC can only handle so much of this, there is no time to delete all the data \"theft shoppers for identity\" to steal, while also monitoring for the FTC as a government agency. So, thank you. Only regret is had I not found you sooner. \\nShandeya \\n![](https://www.optery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/optery-5-start-reviews-1.1.svg)\\nDear Optery Team, I write to you today as a satisfied user of your Ultimate plan, having spent a little over a month under the secure umbrella of your services. Optery has already been a literal firewall in my life and I feel it\\'s important to share my experience for others to understand the value of what you offer. [...] The reason, I firmly believe, was Optery. Your service had acted as an invisible barrier, shielding my personal information from data brokers and unwanted exposure. It\\'s a chilling thought, contemplating what could have occurred had my information been easily accessible. The sense of security I\\'ve gained from knowing my personal details are now secure and not readily available online cannot be overstated. I cannot express enough how much this has improved my peace of mind. Your service has been nothing short of exceptional, especially in terms of the protection level it has provided me. Optery has effectively scrubbed my personal data from prying eyes, instilling a sense of control and safety in my day-to-day online interactions. It is a relief to know that I am not easily found or targeted in the vast web of digital information. Thank you for providing such a crucial service. Your dedication to privacy and security has already made a tangible difference in my life. I will be recommending Optery to others who may be faced with similar concerns or simply seek to control their digital footprints. \\nRay \\n![](https://www.optery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/optery-5-start-reviews-1.1.svg)\\nHi there, Happy Optery premium customer here!

The user interface was intuitive, making it easy to navigate. I found it refreshing how accessible the different features were for managing our online presence without any complications.Another standout aspect was Optery\\'s support system.

Such dedicated customer service is a rarity and deserves *************** all, my experience with Optery has been overwhelmingly positive from start to finish.

If you have any trouble updating your billing or subscription on your own, just email us at support@optery.com and we‚Äôll help you right away. **Upgrades & Downgrades**: If you want to upgrade or downgrade your plan, or change from monthly to yearly, you can do so from the [Optery Dashboard](https://www.optery.com/<https:/app.optery.com>). Just click the ‚ÄúMonthly‚Äù or ‚ÄúYearly‚Äù and ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù or ‚ÄúDowngrade‚Äù buttons above and follow the prompts. There‚Äôs no reason to cancel your plan to make changes. **Pause Billing** : You can pause your subscription and billing at any time by navigating to your [Account](https://www.optery.com/<https:/app.optery.com/account>) page, scrolling down and clicking the button to ‚ÄúPause Subscription‚Äù. **Cancellation** : You can cancel your plan from this page you‚Äôre on right now by downgrading to the ‚ÄúFree Basic‚Äù plan, or by navigating to your [Account](https://www.optery.com/<https:/app.optery.com/account>) page, scrolling down and clicking the button to ‚ÄúCancel Subscription‚Äù. After your paid plan is cancelled, all future billing will stop, but your plan will remain active for the remainder of your billing term, and then will downgrade automatically to the Free Basic tier AFTER your billing term ends so you receive the value of your last subscription payment. **Stop Auto-Renew** : By default, Optery‚Äôs subscriptions auto-renew at the end of your billing term (i.e. Monthly or Yearly). Simply cancel your plan at any time using the instructions above to stop the auto-renew process. After your paid plan is cancelled, all future billing will stop, but your plan will remain active for the remainder of your billing term, and then will downgrade automatically to the Free Basic tier AFTER your billing term ends so you receive the value of your last subscription payment. You can learn more about our billing and payments options on our Help Desk section on [Billing & Payments](https://www.optery.com/<https:/help.optery.com/en/category/billing-payments-on4s4q/>).\\n  * How does your money back guarantee work?\\nIf you are not satisfied with your purchase, within 30 days of your first the purchase cancel your account and then send your refund request to support@optery.com and your refund will be processed within 5 ‚Äì 10 business days. Once your refund is processed, your Optery subscription service will discontinue immediately and your account will automatically be downgraded to Free Basic. More details on the [refund process can be found on our Help Desk here](https://www.optery.com/<https:/help.optery.com/en/article/how-does-your-30-day-money-back-guarantee-work-1f5gimr/>).\\n  * How can I resolve a billing error or discrepancy I have found?\\nBilling errors are rare as we have an advanced system configured to automatically handle upgrades, downgrades, paused subscriptions, and cancellations. That said, we take the accuracy of your payments and billing very seriously, so if you feel you‚Äôve found an error or have any questions about your billing or payments, please send us an email at support@optery.com and we‚Äôll investigate and resolve it right away.\\n  * After upgrading, how long does it take for my profiles to be removed?\\nSome data brokers comply within 24 hours, while others take several weeks, and sometimes months to comply. Each case is unique, but rest assured we are doing our best to streamline the process for you. To set the proper expectations, and in full transparency, getting hundreds of data brokers to comply with opt out requests is a ‚Äúwhack-a-mole‚Äù game that is often never-ending. It is highly unlikely that within a few weeks or months ALL instances of your information will be deleted. If that is your expectation, we recommend not using our service as we don‚Äôt want you to be disappointed. Customer satisfaction and the security of your data are always our top priorities. That said, Optery is very effective at removing the vast majority of exposed profiles on an ongoing basis, and the vast majority of Optery customers are extremely pleased with the results.\\n  * Will Optery completely stop all of my robo calls and email spam?\\nNo. Optery is not an ‚Äúoff‚Äù switch for unwanted email spam and robo calls. Many Optery customers report a dramatic decrease in the volume of unwanted email and phone calls, but this is not the specific function of the product. Instead, the primary purpose of Optery is to protect your privacy by removing you data broker sites posting your personal information on the internet. By removing you from these sites, we take your information like home address, phone number, email, and family members‚Äô names out of circulation reducing your attack surface area by bad actors. Optery is part of a wholistic security and privacy approach that reduces your profile online and makes you a more difficult target to attack.\\n  * What type of sites does Optery NOT cover?\\nOptery only removes from data brokers and people search sites, most of which are listed on your Dashboard. Optery does NOT cover general web sites like blogs, news sites, celebrity sites, community web sites, personal web sites, discussion boards, forum web sites, pornography sites, wiki sites, photo sites, video sites, computer programming web sites, legal records sites, documents posted online (e.g. PDFs, TXTs), or social media sites like LinkedIn, Pinterest, Facebook, Snap, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Optery does NOT remove information from the Dark Web and does Not currently provide Dark Web scanning or reporting. Removing your personal information from the Dark Web is impossible as it is usually placed there by hackers, scammers, spammers, and criminals illegally ‚Äì and there‚Äôs nothing you can do to remove it ‚Äì which is partly why it‚Äôs referred to as the Dark Web. If you need information removal from sites that Optery does not cover, then Optery is not the right solution for you.\\n  * Will Optery be able to remove all of my information from the internet?\\nNo, in the majority of cases, Optery will not be able to remove all of your information from the Internet. Firstly, Optery only covers data broker and people search web sites, so by definition, Optery will not remove your information from other types of sites like blogs, news sites, discussion boards, wiki sites, photo sites, legal records sites, or social media sites like LinkedIn, Pinterest, or Facebook. Furthermore, Optery‚Äôs Terms of Service state: ‚ÄúOptery will use good faith, reasonable efforts to provide the Removal Services, but there is no guarantee or warranty of any kind that third-parties will honor or comply with the opt out, data deletion, do not sell, do not share, suppression or removal requests and it is not possible for Optery, Inc. to remove 100% of your personal information from the Internet, or even from all of the data brokers and information aggregators in each Removal List.‚Äù Optery is able to remove the vast majority of it, but inevitably there are data brokers that may refuse to comply with our requests, data brokers that change their opt out processes causing us trouble, profiles that pop back up and re-populate over time, and the reality is that unfortunately our opt out software is not 100% perfect at this time. This is why most of our customers choose to keep the subscription running on an ongoing basis, to employ our service on a consistent basis. If you do encounter sites that have mistakenly been marked ‚ÄúRemoved / Not Found‚Äù when they are still present, or data broker sites not currently covered by the Ultimate plan, you can submit these sites via our Removals Issues and Custom Removals submission forms. Not withstanding the above, the vast majority of Optery customers are very happy with their results.\\n  * How does Optery opt out on my behalf?\\nOptery reaches out to multiple data brokers on your behalf and automatically submits your opt out requests to remove your Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from their website. We use a ‚Äúhumans + machines‚Äù approach that combines the most advanced automated opt out technology with hands-on expert human privacy agents to deliver maximum removals compared to any other service in the industry. This is one of the reasons why Optery has won the coveted ‚ÄúEditors‚Äô Choice‚Äù award by PCMag.com in 2022, 2023 and 2024 as the most outstanding personal data removal product on the market, and was named a winner in the Security and Privacy category for Fast Company‚Äôs 2023 Next Big Things in Tech awards, and named winner in the Employee Privacy Protection, Attack Surface Management, and Digital Footprint Management categories of the 2024 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards.\\n  * How do your Family plans and family plan discounts work?\\nYou can learn all about how [Optery for Family works on our Help Desk here](https://www.optery.com/<https:/help.optery.com/en/category/optery-for-family-c3zvbx/>).\\n  * What are the main differences between different plan tiers?\\nThe primary differences between the Core, Extended, and Ultimate plans are related to the data brokers each plan covers, and the availability of unlimited Custom Removals. You can scroll to the section titled [Need Help Choosing a Plan?](https://www.optery.com/<https:/www.optery.com/pricing/#data-brokers-we-cover>) on our Pricing page for full details on which data brokers each plan covers, and the differences between each plan, or you can visit our [Help Desk post covering the differences between plans](https://www.optery.com/<https:/help.optery.com/en/article/whats-the-difference-between-the-free-basic-core-extended-and-ultimate-plan-tiers-why-should-i-choose-ultimate-over-the-other-plans-tqye1o/>). To summarize: **Free Basic Plan** ‚Äì free quarterly exposure reporting and self-service tools **Core Plan** ‚Äì low-cost, no frills, plan for ongoing basic coverage **Extended Plan** ‚Äì best value

Optery has effectively scrubbed my personal data from prying eyes, instilling a sense of control and safety in my day-to-day online interactions. It is a relief to know that I am not easily found or targeted in the vast web of digital information. Thank you for providing such a crucial service.

You can learn more about our billing and payments options on our Help Desk section on Billing & Payments‚ü®79‚ü©.\\n  * How does your money back guarantee work?\\nIf you are not satisfied with your purchase, within 30 days of your first the purchase cancel your account and then send your refund request to support@optery.com and your refund will be processed within 5 ‚Äì 10 business days. Once your refund is processed, your Optery subscription service will discontinue immediately and your account will automatically be downgraded to Free Basic. More details on the refund process can be found on our Help Desk here‚ü®80‚ü©.\\n  * How can I resolve a billing error or discrepancy I have found?\\nBilling errors are rare as we have an advanced system configured to automatically handle upgrades, downgrades, paused subscriptions, and cancellations. That said, we take the accuracy of your payments and billing very seriously, so if you feel you‚Äôve found an error or have any questions about your billing or payments, please send us an email at support@optery.com and we‚Äôll investigate and resolve it right away.\\n  * After upgrading, how long does it take for my profiles to be removed?\\nSome data brokers comply within 24 hours, while others take several weeks, and sometimes months to comply. Each case is unique, but rest assured we are doing our best to streamline the process for you. To set the proper expectations, and in full transparency, getting hundreds of data brokers to comply with opt out requests is a ‚Äúwhack-a-mole‚Äù game that is often never-ending. It is highly unlikely that within a few weeks or months ALL instances of your information will be deleted. If that is your expectation, we recommend not using our service as we don‚Äôt want you to be disappointed. Customer satisfaction and the security of your data are always our top priorities. That said, Optery is very effective at removing the vast majority of exposed profiles on an ongoing basis, and the vast majority of Optery customers are extremely pleased with the results.\\n  * Will Optery completely stop all of my robo calls and email spam?\\nNo. Optery is not an ‚Äúoff‚Äù switch for unwanted email spam and robo calls. Many Optery customers report a dramatic decrease in the volume of unwanted email and phone calls, but this is not the specific function of the product. Instead, the primary purpose of Optery is to protect your privacy by removing you data broker sites posting your personal information on the internet. By removing you from these sites, we take your information like home address, phone number, email, and family members‚Äô names out of circulation reducing your attack surface area by bad actors. Optery is part of a wholistic security and privacy approach that reduces your profile online and makes you a more difficult target to attack.\\n  * What type of sites does Optery NOT cover?\\nOptery only removes from data brokers and people search sites, most of which are listed on your Dashboard. Optery does NOT cover general web sites like blogs, news sites, celebrity sites, community web sites, personal web sites, discussion boards, forum web sites, pornography sites, wiki sites, photo sites, video sites, computer programming web sites, legal records sites, documents posted online (e.g. PDFs, TXTs), or social media sites like LinkedIn, Pinterest, Facebook, Snap, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Optery does NOT remove information from the Dark Web and does Not currently provide Dark Web scanning or reporting. Removing your personal information from the Dark Web is impossible as it is usually placed there by hackers, scammers, spammers, and criminals illegally ‚Äì and there‚Äôs nothing you can do to remove it ‚Äì which is partly why it‚Äôs referred to as the Dark Web. If you need information removal from sites that Optery does not cover, then Optery is not the right solution for you.\\n  * Will Optery be able to remove all of my information from the internet?\\nNo, in the majority of cases, Optery will not be able to remove all of your information from the Internet. Firstly, Optery only covers data broker and people search web sites, so by definition, Optery will not remove your information from other types of sites like blogs, news sites, discussion boards, wiki sites, photo sites, legal records sites, or social media sites like LinkedIn, Pinterest, or Facebook. Furthermore, Optery‚Äôs Terms of Service state: ‚ÄúOptery will use good faith, reasonable efforts to provide the Removal Services, but there is no guarantee or warranty of any kind that third-parties will honor or comply with the opt out, data deletion, do not sell, do not share, suppression or removal requests and it is not possible for Optery, Inc. to remove 100% of your personal information from the Internet, or even from all of the data brokers and information aggregators in each Removal List.‚Äù Optery is able to remove the vast majority of it, but inevitably there are data brokers that may refuse to comply with our requests, data brokers that change their opt out processes causing us trouble, profiles that pop back up and re-populate over time, and the reality is that unfortunately our opt out software is not 100% perfect at this time. This is why most of our customers choose to keep the subscription running on an ongoing basis, to employ our service on a consistent basis. If you do encounter sites that have mistakenly been marked ‚ÄúRemoved / Not Found‚Äù when they are still present, or data broker sites not currently covered by the Ultimate plan, you can submit these sites via our Removals Issues and Custom Removals submission forms. Not withstanding the above, the vast majority of Optery customers are very happy with their results.\\n  * How does Optery opt out on my behalf?\\nOptery reaches out to multiple data brokers on your behalf and automatically submits your opt out requests to remove your Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from their website. We use a ‚Äúhumans + machines‚Äù approach that combines the most advanced automated opt out technology with hands-on expert human privacy agents to deliver maximum removals compared to any other service in the industry. This is one of the reasons why Optery has won the coveted ‚ÄúEditors‚Äô Choice‚Äù award by PCMag.com in 2022, 2023 and 2024 as the most outstanding personal data removal product on the market, and was named a winner in the Security and Privacy category for Fast Company‚Äôs 2023 Next Big Things in Tech awards, and named winner in the Employee Privacy Protection, Attack Surface Management, and Digital Footprint Management categories of the 2024 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards.\\n  * How do your Family plans and family plan discounts work?\\nYou can learn all about how Optery for Family works on our Help Desk here‚ü®81‚ü©.\\n  * What are the main differences between different plan tiers?\\nThe primary differences between the Core, Extended, and Ultimate plans are related to the data brokers each plan covers, and the availability of unlimited Custom Removals. You can scroll to the section titled Need Help Choosing a Plan?‚ü®82‚ü© on our Pricing page for full details on which data brokers each plan covers, and the differences between each plan, or you can visit our Help Desk post covering the differences between plans‚ü®83‚ü©. To summarize: **Free Basic Plan** ‚Äì free quarterly exposure reporting and self-service tools **Core Plan** ‚Äì low-cost, no frills, plan for ongoing basic coverage **Extended Plan** ‚Äì best value plan **Ultimate Plan** ‚Äì most comprehensive coverage, our most popular plan\\n\\n\\n**Ready to safeguard your personal data?**\\nJoin the movement of people strengthening their privacy \\n Sign Up

  "generated_description": "**Optery: Privacy for the Digital Age**\n\nFounded in 2020 and based in Walnut Creek, California, Optery is a trailblazer in the realm of online privacy, focused on helping individuals, families, and businesses remove their personal information from the internet. Their mission? To combat the pervasive issue of data brokers who collect and sell sensitive information like home addresses and phone numbers. \n\nAt its core, Optery provides automated opt-out software that enables users to eliminate their profiles from over 610 data broker sites‚Äîa feat unmatched by competitors.
