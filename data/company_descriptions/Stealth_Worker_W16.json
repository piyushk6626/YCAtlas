Stealth Worker ensures you get a great match for the skill sets you need. We take care of billing for the Stealth Workers, and are there to help whenever you need us. \\n####  [Q:Who are Stealth Workers?](https://www.stealthworker.com/<#>)\\n##### Answer\\nMost Stealth Workers are information security professionals or sales engineers with at least five years enterprise experience.

Why is this important for me?](https://www.stealthworker.com/<#>)\\n##### Answer\\nCEOs need to ensure their brand is appropriately protected. We empower your CISO to do this at a higher quality and lower price than the traditional employment model. CEOs of Tech companies also need to shorten their sales cycle, increase closure rate and control costs. Stealth Worker optimizes all three.\\n####  [Q: I am a CISO. Why is this important for me?](https://www.stealthworker.com/<#>)\\n##### Answer\\nThe success of a CISO depends on having the right team competent in the right tools.

This results in huge security breaches, as CISOs cannot obtain the talented staff and tools they need in the current market.
