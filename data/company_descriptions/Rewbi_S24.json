  "description": "Rewbi uses AI to optimize grid-connected battery storage. We generate revenue by charging when electricity is cheap and discharging when electricity is expensive.\r\n\nWe rent battery storage for a fixed fee per month, and we earn 2x that fee in monthly revenue by dispatching the battery optimally.\r\n\nToday, power companies use human traders to manually track grid conditions and update the battery’s dispatch schedule. However batteries can adjust their power output 100x faster than traditional power generation (e.g. hydro, coal, nuclear, gas), with the ability to go from full-speed charging to to full speed discharging in under a minute. Electricity prices change every 5 minutes, often by 300% or more. Our AI better tracks 100s of live inputs, and it makes decisions faster than a human operator (with lower overhead!), improving revenue 2x.",

  "generated_description": "**Company Summary: Rewbi**\n\nRewbi is an innovative company aimed at revolutionizing the energy sector by leveraging artificial intelligence to optimize grid-connected battery storage. Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, Rewbi's mission is to double the revenue generated from these battery systems. \n\n### What They Do\nInitially focusing on optimizing battery storage, Rewbi enhances profitability by charging batteries when electricity rates are low and discharging them when prices peak—transforming a straightforward rental model into a revenue-generating powerhouse. Their business model is simple: they charge a fixed monthly fee for battery storage but increase that revenue twofold through smart dispatching.\n\n### The Problem They Solve\nTraditionally, power companies rely on human traders to manage battery dispatch schedules, which is slow and inefficient. Rewbi's AI technology changes the game. Batteries can adjust their output significantly faster—up to 100 times quicker than traditional power sources like coal or gas. Given that electricity prices can fluctuate dramatically—sometimes by 300% within five minutes—Rewbi’s AI can analyze hundreds of data points in real-time to make instant decisions that optimize battery dispatch.\n\n### Team and Expertise\nThe company sports a lean team of two co-founders with notable backgrounds: \n- **Thomas Marge**, the CEO, previously founded inBalance, a Y Combinator company acquired by Stem, where he led battery storage optimization.\n- **Derek Modzelewski**, the CTO, has deep experience in energy commodities and AI, having previously worked with Meta's foundational models.\n\nThis strong expertise merges energy and AI proficiencies, which is crucial for driving the clean energy transition.\n\n### Clean Energy Future\nRewbi is not just about profits; it focuses on sustainability. Modern grids often rely on backup fossil fuel sources, contributing to over 1% of global carbon emissions during peak demands. Rewbi aims to replace these systems with clean battery alternatives, pushing toward a greener energy future.\n\n### Conclusion\nRewbi is at the forefront of a significant shift in the energy sector, combining advanced AI with battery storage solutions to create efficiency that the industry desperately needs. The company is set to improve grid reliability, drive down costs associated with power volatility, and help in the fight against climate change, all while ensuring a profitable outcome for battery investors.\n\nFor more information, check out their [website](https://www.rewbi.com)."
