It\\'s a quick scan that measures the calcium buildup in the arteries of your heart, an early indicator of atherosclerosis—a condition that leads to heart disease. By providing a CAC score, the test offers a clear picture of your future risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks. The higher your CAC score, the more calcified plaque you have in your arteries, increasing your heart disease risk. On the other hand, a score of zero indicates a low risk of heart disease.\\nBrowse Research \\n## Frequently asked questions\\nIf you have any questions, chat with us.\\nWhat does the concierge
