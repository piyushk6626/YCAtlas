  "generated_description": "Ledger Investing is carving out a unique niche in the world of finance, focusing on insurance securitization. Think of them as a marketplace where serious capital meets innovative risk management. Founded in 2016 by Julien Brissonneau, Aymeric Rabot, and Samir Shah—who cut their teeth in Y Combinator’s Batch W17—this New York-based firm is on a mission to create a robust ecosystem for insurance-linked securities (ILS).\n\nWhat does that mean? For asset managers, pension funds, hedge funds, and family offices, it’s about tapping into an asset class that’s gaining traction. Ledger provides these investors with the tools and insights to deploy their capital strategically within various types of insurance risk portfolios. Their proprietary software and data analytics streamline the process, allowing insurers to securitize risks more effectively.
