It’s designed to be easy for kids to use, and all they need to do is tap a book and start reading. When they get stuck on a word, they just tap it for help from Ello.

It’s designed to be easy for kids to use, and all they need to do is tap a book and start reading. When they get stuck on a word, they just tap it for help from Ello. As they complete quests, Ello will challenge them a little more each time, and they’ll unlock new, engaging content to keep them moving along their journey.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652e0352ad50feae8734edac/652e0352ad50feae8734f374_Vector%2017.svg)\\nHow does Ello keep my child engaged?\\nAs your child reads, Ello brings the story to life, provides words of encouragement, and helps them if they get stuck so they don\\'t get frustrated. \\nWe use behavioral psychology and a growth mindset paradigm to keep your child encouraged, help their confidence soar, and build a love of reading. \\nEllo offers a reward system as well. In this system, children collect stars and badges, leading up to a completion prize that is either delivered digitally, included in the next box, or both!\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652e0352ad50feae8734edac/652e0352ad50feae8734f374_Vector%2017.svg)\\nMy child is reading the words wrong but Ello isn’t correcting them. What’s going on?\\nSince children can get easily discouraged, Ello leans on the lenient side. We recommend sitting with your child when they read and helping with some of these corrections yourself. \\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/652e0352ad50feae8734edac/652e0352ad50feae8734f374_Vector%2017.svg)\\nIs Ello good for kids with dyslexia?\\nEllo’s instructional method was developed by reading specialists with backgrounds in dyslexia intervention and uses direct, explicit, and sequential phonics instruction.
