Yardbook does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent. However, how we disclose your personal information to third parties under this Agreement includes:\\n  * _Vendors, Consultants and Other Service Providers_ : We may share your information with third-party vendors, suppliers and other service providers who are working on our behalf and require access to your information to carry out that work, such as to process billing, provide customer support, perform statistical analysis, facilitate communication with you, arrange for deliveries, etc. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Yardbook, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.\\n  * _Business Transfers_ : We may disclose your information to a third party in connection with a corporate reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings.\\n  * _Compliance with Laws_ : We may disclose your information to a third party if (a) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) to enforce our agreements, policies and Terms of Service, (c) to protect the security or integrity of the Yardbook Services, (d) to protect Yardbook, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) to respond to an emergency which we believe in the good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.\\n  * _Third Party Promotional Offers_ : Yardbook does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.

We may not recognize or respond to every type of \"do not track\" signal or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of PII about the individual user\\'s online activity, whether through our Services, third-party services or online services. We do not control any third party\\'s collection of your PII, including third parties that advertise on our Services or when you access a third-party site through our Services.\\nMany Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.

We will not share PII about you with any third party except as described in this Privacy Statement or in connection with the Yardbook Services. Yardbook does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent. However, how we disclose your personal information to third parties under this Agreement includes:\\n  * _Vendors, Consultants and Other Service Providers_ : We may share your information with third-party vendors, suppliers and other service providers who are working on our behalf and require access to your information to carry out that work, such as to process billing, provide customer support, perform statistical analysis, facilitate communication with you, arrange for deliveries, etc. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Yardbook, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.\\n  * _Business Transfers_ : We may disclose your information to a third party in connection with a corporate reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings.\\n  * _Compliance with Laws_ : We may disclose your information to a third party if (a) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) to enforce our agreements, policies and Terms of Service, (c) to protect the security or integrity of the Yardbook Services, (d) to protect Yardbook, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) to respond to an emergency which we believe in the good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.\\n  * _Third Party Promotional Offers_ : Yardbook does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.

Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.\\nOne of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with Yardbook, a cookie helps Yardbook recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, etc. When you return to the same Yardbook website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Yardbook features that you customized.\\n#### Personalized or Targeted Advertising and Do Not Track\\nWe believe that a more personalized experience will better serve your use of our Services and we may provide targeted advertising and other opportunities based upon our collection of PII from your use of our Services and use of other online websites.

We may not recognize or respond to every type of \"do not track\" signal or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of PII about the individual user\\'s online activity, whether through our Services, third-party services or online services. We do not control any third party\\'s collection of your PII, including third parties that advertise on our Services or when you access a third-party site through our Services.\\nMany Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove and reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies (such as using an opt-out cookie), this could affect certain features or the user experience of our Services.
