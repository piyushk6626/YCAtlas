Yardbook does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent. However, how we disclose your personal information to third parties under this Agreement includes:\\n  * _Vendors, Consultants and Other Service Providers_ : We may share your information with third-party vendors, suppliers and other service providers who are working on our behalf and require access to your information to carry out that work, such as to process billing, provide customer support, perform statistical analysis, facilitate communication with you, arrange for deliveries, etc. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Yardbook, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.\\n  * _Business Transfers_ : We may disclose your information to a third party in connection with a corporate reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings.\\n  * _Compliance with Laws_ : We may disclose your information to a third party if (a) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) to enforce our agreements, policies and Terms of Service, (c) to protect the security or integrity of the Yardbook Services, (d) to protect Yardbook, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) to respond to an emergency which we believe in the good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.\\n  * _Third Party Promotional Offers_ : Yardbook does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.

Any links to such third-party websites are for your convenience and the inclusion of such links on our website does not imply any endorsement, guarantee, warranty or representation by Yardbook of the quality or accuracy of the content, information, products or services or other materials provided to you on those third party websites.\\n#### Taxes and Third-Party Fees\\nYou are solely responsible for and must pay all applicable taxes, and any applicable third-party fee (such as telephone charges, mobile carrier fees, ISP charges, data plan charges, SMS and third-party payment processing fees) that may result from your use of our Services.\\n#### Consent to Send Text Messages\\nPrior to sending the first message, you must obtain agreement from the message recipient to communicate with them - this is referred to as \"consent\", you must make clear to the individual they are agreeing to receive messages of the type you\\'re going to send. You need to keep a record of the consent, such as a copy of the document or form that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed a sign-up flow. \\nIf an individual sends a message to you, you are free to respond in an exchange with that individual. For example, if an individual texts your phone number asking for your hours of operation, you can respond directly to that individual, relaying your open hours. In such a case, the individual\u2019s inbound message to you constitutes both consent and proof of consent. Remember that the consent is limited only to that particular conversation. Unless you obtain additional consent, don\\'t send messages that are outside that conversation. \\nYou may send a message to an individual where you have a prior relationship, provided that individual provided their phone number to you, and has taken some action to trigger the potential communication, and has not expressed a preference to not receive messages from you. Actions can include a button press, alert setup, appointments, or order placements. Examples of acceptable messages in these scenarios include appointment reminders, receipts, one-time passwords, order/shipping/reservation confirmations, drivers coordinating pick up locations with riders, and repair persons confirming service call times. In this case, the message can\\'t attempt to promote a product, convince someone to buy something, or advocate for a social cause.\\n#### Feedback and Suggestions\\nIf you submit feedback, comments, ideas or suggestions (collectively \"**Suggestions** \") about our Services, you acknowledge that such Suggestions are unsolicited and that we may, but have no obligation, to use your Suggestions.
