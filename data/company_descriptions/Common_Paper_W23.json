These are analogous to the SAFE, but are between customers and vendors rather than investors and startups. The standardized format means that data within contracts is structured from inception. \r\n\nWe build software for managing standard contracts, accelerating sales cycles, and making the data within the contracts programmatically accessible to other business systems.\r\n\nThousands of people have downloaded our standard contracts, and 63% of the contracts on our system close within 24 hours.",
