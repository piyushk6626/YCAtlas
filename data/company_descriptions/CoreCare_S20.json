CoreCare can reduce the time spent on Medicaid pending cases by up to 50%, eliminate missed renewals and forms effectively, and provide actionable insights to improve cash flow. With an integrated system that works seamlessly with existing EHRs and state Medicaid systems, CoreCare is fast becoming the go-to platform for nursing homes looking to improve financial performance and operational efficiency.\n\nWith just a team of 11, CoreCare is already making a monumental impact in the healthcare industry. They’ve got backing from influential figures, including Group Partner Dalton Caldwell, and their client testimonials echo the transformative impact of their services.\n\nFor those in the healthcare sector looking to liberate themselves from cumbersome workflows and embrace the future, CoreCare is not just an option; it’s a necessity.
