  "generated_description": "**Lumineye: Revolutionizing Situational Awareness for First Responders**\n\nFounded in 2017 and a proud member of Y Combinator’s Batch S19, Lumineye is a Boise, ID-based startup on a mission to give first responders \"X-ray vision\" through innovative radar technology. With a small but dedicated team of 10, Lumineye is making waves in the hardware and govtech sectors by creating portable, tactical through-wall radar sensors. These devices allow firefighters, law enforcement, and search-and-rescue teams to see through walls and assess situations before they enter hazardous environments.\n\nImagine walking up to a building and knowing exactly what’s inside without stepping through the door. This is precisely what Lumineye offers: critical information that enhances situational awareness and ultimately saves lives. Their compact, lightweight sensors are designed for various applications, detecting moving and breathing individuals within a range of 30 to 40 feet. \n\nLumineye’s technology integrates seamlessly with familiar platforms like the Team Awareness Kit (TAK) and Hololens, ensuring that first responders have the necessary tools to prepare for any contingency. If this sounds appealing, you can learn more and even request a demo on their [website](https://www.lumineye.com).\n\nBy focusing on the needs of first responders — the heroes who run towards danger — Lumineye is not just building a product; they're creating a vital resource that could change the course of emergency response. Their commitment to situational awareness through cutting-edge radar technology is setting a new standard in the field."
