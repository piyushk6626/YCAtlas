  "description": "PAX is a new crypto exchange and is the first – in all capital markets – to operate from a single chip rather than an entire datacenter. Today, high frequency traders (\"HFTs\") pay handsomely to co-locate (\"co-lo\") their algorithms near to the exchange. PAX moves traders to within nanometers of the exchange – closer than ever before possible.\r\n\nSuch proximity unlocks unprecedented value to high frequency customers and PAX shares this value by offering zero-fee with cash-back to every other market participant on every trade. PAX is to exchange as Robinhood was to retail brokerage: the first in the industry to “go to zero” and a complete game changer across every asset and geography.\r\n\nPAX founders, Pete and Ben have spent years working as high-frequency traders, from crypto to traditional markets. Having directly experienced the benefit of electronic trading, they share a belief in its potential to further evolve and create better global markets.",

  "generated_description": "### PAX Markets, Inc. \n\n**Overview**  \nPAX Markets, Inc. is an innovative crypto exchange that’s breaking new ground by operating from a single chip instead of the cumbersome datacenters that dominate the industry. Founded in 2024, and part of Y Combinator Batch W25, PAX aims to redefine trading speed and cost for high-frequency traders (HFTs) and retail users alike.\n\n**Mission**  \nThe vision behind PAX is bold: to provide a trading platform that is faster and more efficient than ever. By minimizing the distance between traders and the exchange to mere nanometers, PAX facilitates lightning-fast trades and aims to share the benefits of this proximity with its users through a groundbreaking pricing model.\n\n**What They Offer**  \nPAX stands as a game-changer akin to what Robinhood accomplished in the retail brokerage space. By eliminating transaction fees and introducing a cash-back system for trades, PAX sets out to democratize market access. In contrast to traditional exchanges that charge hefty fees, PAX’s “zero-fee + cash-back” model is designed to attract a broad spectrum of market participants.\n\n**Key Features**  \n1. **Zero Fees**: Unlike most crypto exchanges, PAX does not charge transaction fees. If you’re not using their HFT-focused λ API, you incur no costs and can even receive cash-back on trades.\n  \n2. **Ultra-Fast Transactions**: Response times are drastically reduced from microseconds to nanoseconds thanks to their unique expertise in embedding the exchange’s systems into silicon. This achievement represents a 1000x improvement in trading speed.\n  \n3. **Direct Market Integration**: The λ API allows traders to execute orders with zero network delay, making PAX the fastest in tick-to-trade operations.\n  \n4. **Value for All Participants**: By providing tools that cater both to HFT operations and regular traders, PAX’s infrastructure aims to elevate the entire trading experience.\n\n**Founders**  \nPete and Ben, whose backgrounds in high-frequency trading span both crypto and traditional markets, lead PAX. Their firsthand experience in electronic trading equips them with the insights to build a platform that enhances market potential and profitability.\n\n**Current Status**  \nPAX is actively developing its platform, with plans for a demo on AWS F1 FPGA instances slated for Q1 2025. Early access to their API will be available on an invitation-only basis, indicating strong interest from potential users.\n\n**Tagline**  \nPAX is more than just a crypto exchange; it's a leap towards creating a more efficient and accessible trading environment for everyone.\n\nFor more information, visit their [website](https://pax.markets/) and consider joining their waitlist as they prepare to revolutionize the crypto trading landscape."
