  "description": "Asseta is an online marketplace for used capital equipment and parts.  We utilize innovative software to bring buyers and sellers together so you can efficiently and transparently collaborate during equipment transactions.  Our web based platform ensures easy price discovery for interested parties and high touch customer service.\r\n\nToday over $100B is spent on used manufacturing equipment offline via brokers and middlemen. This huge but un-sexy market has yet to be transformed by technology. The incumbent firms rely on large sales forces and the fragmentation of the market to charge huge margins.   We believe in a better solution.\r\n\nFounded in 2013, Asseta is Y Combinator backed startup based in Newport Beach.

  "generated_description": "Asseta is redefining the marketplace for industrial spare parts and capital equipment. Founded in 2013 and backed by Y Combinator, the company is based in Newport Beach, California, and employs a small, dedicated team of four. At their core, Asseta aims to streamline the process of buying and selling used manufacturing equipment, a market that, surprisingly, sees over $100 billion spent each year through traditional brokers and middlemen.\n\nWhat makes Asseta stand out? For starters, their innovative online platform leverages technology to facilitate transactions transparently and efficiently. This isn’t just about convenience; it challenges the traditional high-margin practices of incumbents that rely on large sales forces and a fragmented market. Asseta believes there's a better way.\n\nThe company offers over 450,000 listings from various suppliers—including fabs, refurbishers, and dealers—making it easier for users to discover the parts they need. With features like easy quote requests, price comparisons, and quick delivery options, Asseta provides a compelling alternative to the chaos previously associated with industrial equipment transactions.\n\nFor buyers, Asseta promises significant savings—between 40% to 60% on parts—while ensuring fast, high-touch customer service. Their platform is designed to help users find the specific parts they need without endlessly combing through listings. For sellers, the company provides an efficient way to reach a broader audience and simplify the quoting process.\n\nIf you're in the market for industrial parts and equipment or simply curious about how this space is being modernized, explore more at [asseta.com](http://www.asseta.com) or check out their [AngelList profile](https://angel.co/asseta?ref=startup_card). In a sector that many overlook, Asseta is making waves—and it might just be worth watching."
