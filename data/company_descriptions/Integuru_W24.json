  "generated_description": "**Integuru: Integrations Made Easy without Official APIs**\n\nFounded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch W24, Integuru is a San Francisco-based company with a sharp focus: building low-latency integrations with platforms that lack official APIs. It’s a space that many developers find frustrating, and Integuru is here to change that.\n\n### Mission\nInteguru's mission is simple and powerful: **Integrations without official APIs**. They’re on a quest to democratize access to data through innovative integration solutions.\n\n### The Technology\nInteguru stands out for developing the first AI agent designed to create permissionless integrations by reverse-engineering internal APIs. This means they can help businesses connect their tools in ways that were previously impossible or cumbersome. Their service encompasses everything from **authentication management** to building and hosting integrations, all aimed at making the developer's life easier.\n\n### Services Offered\nInteguru provides a comprehensive set of services:\n- **Custom Integrations:** They handle the full lifecycle of integrations, ensuring seamless connectivity between platforms.\n- **Hosting and Authentication Management:** They offer hosted services to manage authentication for various integrations.\n\n### Pricing\nPricing is designed to be straightforward:\n- **$0.10 per API call**, with a **minimum of $150/month** per platform. They’re also open to special requests from enterprises.\n\n### User-Friendly Approach\nTheir integrations are open-source by default, a testament to their commitment to transparency and community collaboration. They encourage users to leverage their AI agent, making third-party integration creation more accessible. You can dive into their work via their [GitHub Repo](https://www.integuru.ai/<https:/github.com/Integuru-AI/Integuru>).\n\n### Trust and Partnerships\nInteguru has quickly garnered trust from notable companies like Andy AI, Cal.com, Electric Air, Luminai, and more. This speaks volumes about their credibility and the value they provide.\n\n### The Team\nDespite being a small team of two, Integuru is making big waves. They’re led by a capable group partner, Gustaf Alstromer, who is no stranger to fostering innovative startups. \n\nAs they continue to carve out their niche in the developer tools market, Integuru represents a significant step forward in how we create integrations. If you’re interested in exploring what they can do for you, you can schedule a call with Richard on their website.\n\n**Website:** [Integuru](https://www.integuru.ai) \n\nInteguru isn’t just about solving a problem; they’re about creating opportunities in the world of integrations. If you’re tired of the limitations imposed by official APIs, it might be time to check them out."
