Ironclad is software that does all the administrative work better left for a robot, freeing legal teams to do more substantive work and drive business strategy. By automating contracting processes and extracting intelligence from contracts, Ironclad lets legal teams focus on legal work, rather than paperwork. Legal teams at companies like Gusto, HotelTonight, GoFundMe, Glassdoor, Procore use Ironclad to get their contracts done more efficiently and accurately, and to maintain a single source of truth regarding their contents.\r\n\nHeadquartered in San Francisco, Ironclad is backed by Accel, Greylock, SV Angel, Formation 8, and was incubated in Y Combinator.
