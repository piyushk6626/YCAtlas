  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Revenir**\n\n**Founded:** 2019  \n**Location:** London, United Kingdom  \n**Team Size:** 11 employees  \n**Batch:** Y Combinator W20  \n**Website:** [revenir.ai](https://www.revenir.ai)  \n**Focus Areas:** Fintech, SaaS, Travel  \n\n**Mission:**  \nRevenir aims to be the first API solution for tax returns, simplifying the VAT refund process for individuals and corporations globally.\n\n---\n\n**The Story Behind Revenir:**\n\nRevenir began with a simple yet powerful idea: \"Your free money back to you with the trust of your own bank.\" This vision drives their mission to help people reclaim the value-added tax (VAT) on purchases made abroad. It's astonishing how much VAT goes unclaimed—around 80%—and Revenir is here to change that.\n\n**How They Do It:**\n\nBy automating tax recovery processes through partnerships with banks, Revenir eliminates the cumbersome, paperwork-heavy process typically associated with VAT refunds. Instead, customers simply upload a picture of their receipts through their banking app, and Revenir takes care of the rest. You'll receive your VAT reclaim back in your account—often within just 48 hours—without having to queue at an airport or fill out confusing forms.\n\n**Who They Work With:**\n\nRevenir collaborates with various financial institutions, allowing them to offer these VAT reclaim services to their customers seamlessly. Their white-label solutions empower banks and card providers to integrate this functionality via APIs, enhancing customer experience and potentially generating additional revenue streams.\n\n**Cutting-Edge Technology:**\n\nAt the heart of Revenir’s platform are advanced technologies like machine learning and optical recognition. These help automatically identify eligible purchases, streamline the claim process, and ensure users never miss out on what they're owed. Revenir’s architecture utilizes AWS for robust and sustainable operations, reflecting their commitment to both innovation and environmental responsibility.\n\n**Sustainability Efforts:**\n\nRevenir takes sustainability seriously. They’ve reduced paper waste by eliminating reliance on physical receipts and forms. In partnership with Ecologi, they plant a tree for every ten VAT reclaims processed, contributing to global reforestation efforts. Their operations are powered by renewable energy sources, further reducing their carbon footprint.\n\n**The Revenir Advantage:**\n\nWith Revenir, you can say goodbye to the headaches of traditional VAT reclaim processes. No waiting in long lines or enduring confusing forms. Just easy, integrated solutions that let you focus on enjoying your travels, all while ensuring you get the VAT refunds you deserve.\n\nIn a nutshell, Revenir isn’t just about reclaiming taxes; it’s about transforming the user experience through technology and sustainability. If you’re someone who frequently travels and shops internationally, you might want to keep an eye on this innovative player in the fintech space."
