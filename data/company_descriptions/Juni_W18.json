Students go at their own pace from basic concepts to completing a master project of their choice – it can be a full-stack website, a game, or solving a difficult algorithm problem.\\n2. The best of the best instructors\\nWe accept instructors only from the top computer science universities. Besides being subject matter experts, they have the best personality fit – patient, warm, and motivating. They are mentors and near-peers to the students. We have an acceptance rate below 5% because we carefully select the best of the best.\\n3. Personalized approach\\nEvery new student starts with a placement class to determine the experience level. We look into the combination of coding, math, and problem-solving skills to place the student in the right class. Some students start as beginners and quickly advance into a more difficult class with full support from their instructor.\\n4. All-in-one user-friendly platform\\nAll classes, projects, and everything you need are built into one software platform. You don’t need to leave the platform to watch a video, participate in your class, or do your homework. Parents and students can manage class schedules, connect with the instructor, and see the notes from the class – all in one place.\\n5. Extensive support for parents and students\\nIf a student needs extra help, instructors are always available to answer questions, even outside the class. We have additional videos and projects for students who want more work. Plus, our customer support is there to keep students & parents happy. \\n#### Frequently Asked Questions\\n[What is Juni’s expected weekly time commitment?](https://junilearning.com/<https:/junilearning.com/null>)\\nWe’re made to fit your schedule—\\nYou can build your plan for 1:1 classes at a frequency and time that work best for you.

Unique student-paced curriculum\\nJuni’s unique curriculum takes students from a beginner to a college, junior engineer, or even senior engineer level without burnout. Students go at their own pace from basic concepts to completing a master project of their choice – it can be a full-stack website, a game, or solving a difficult algorithm problem.\\n2. The best of the best instructors\\nWe accept instructors only from the top computer science universities. Besides being subject matter experts, they have the best personality fit – patient, warm, and motivating. They are mentors and near-peers to the students. We have an acceptance rate below 5% because we carefully select the best of the best.\\n3. Personalized approach\\nEvery new student starts with a placement class to determine the experience level. We look into the combination of coding, math, and problem-solving skills to place the student in the right class. Some students start as beginners and quickly advance into a more difficult class with full support from their instructor.\\n4. All-in-one user-friendly platform\\nAll classes, projects, and everything you need are built into one software platform. You don’t need to leave the platform to watch a video, participate in your class, or do your homework. Parents and students can manage class schedules, connect with the instructor, and see the notes from the class – all in one place.\\n5. Extensive support for parents and students\\nIf a student needs extra help, instructors are always available to answer questions, even outside the class. We have additional videos and projects for students who want more work. Plus, our customer support is there to keep students & parents happy. \\n#### Frequently Asked Questions\\nWhat is Juni’s expected weekly time commitment?⟨46⟩\\nWe’re made to fit your schedule—\\nYou can build your plan for 1:1 classes at a frequency and time that work best for you. You can always reschedule or adjust if anything changes later!\\nOutside of classes, there is typically 30-60 minutes of optional homework to accelerate the learning. Juni students also get access to additional class support, and project creation tools!\\nWhich coding language should my child learn?⟨46⟩\\nTypically, our beginning coders ages 7-10 start in Scratch 1 and any beginning coders 11+ start in Python 1. If your child already has some coding experience, please let us know when you sign up so we can sign them up for the appropriate level.\\nWhat kind of technical setup will my child need at home?⟨46⟩\\n**Our courses require:** 1- A desktop or laptop computer that runs Windows or Mac OS, with a working microphone, speaker, and webcam. 2- The Chrome browser and Zoom Client must be installed. 3- A high-speed internet connection (at least 10 Mbps).
