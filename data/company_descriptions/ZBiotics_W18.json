We are excited to announce that we have launched our second product and now have two products, built with the same technology but for different purposes:\\n[**ZBiotics® Pre-Alcohol**](https://zbiotics.com/<https:/zbiotics.com/products/zbiotics>)\\n**For easier mornings after drinking.**\\nOur original product, built to help you land on your feet the day after drinking alcohol by breaking down an unwanted byproduct called acetaldehyde while you drink and while you sleep—setting you up for a great next morning.\\n[**ZBiotics® Sugar-to-Fiber**](https://zbiotics.com/<https:/zbiotics.com/products/sugar-to-fiber>)\\n**For turning sugar into fiber in your gut**\\nOur second product, newly launched to help you make the most of a modern diet by converting sugar you eat into fiber in your gut, gently and all day long—improving microbiome health.\\n### What is ZBiotics® Pre-Alcohol Probiotic Drink?\\nZBiotics Pre-Alcohol (or Pre-Alcohol for short) is a beverage containing a patented, genetically engineered probiotic (_B. subtilis_ ZB183™) that helps you land on your feet the day after drinking alcohol. It’s engineered to break down an unwanted byproduct of alcohol called acetaldehyde – the main culprit behind rough mornings after drinking ([citation](https://zbiotics.com/<https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8811162/>)).\\n### How does Pre-Alcohol work?\\nPre-Alcohol is designed to replicate the natural process of your liver, but do it in your gut. We took a normal probiotic bacteria you already eat every day, and we bioengineered it to produce the same type of enzyme your liver produces ([citation](https://zbiotics.com/<https:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8461600/>)). That enzyme breaks down acetaldehyde – an unwanted byproduct of alcohol that accumulates in your gut when you drink.\\nYour liver does not have access to your gut. But by drinking Pre-Alcohol, the goal is to augment your gut’s natural ability to digest acetaldehyde while you drink and while you sleep – helping you make the most of the next day. Just remember that Pre-Alcohol won’t affect intoxication or make alcohol safer to drink, so always drink responsibly.[Learn more about how Pre-Alcohol works.](https://zbiotics.com/<https:/zbiotics.com/pages/how-it-works-1>)\\n### What is ZBiotics Sugar-to-Fiber Probiotic Drink Mix?\\nZBiotics Sugar-to-Fiber (or “Sugar-to-Fiber” for short) is a drink mix containing a patented, genetically engineered probiotic (_B. subtilis_ ZB423™) that converts a small amount of the sugar you eat every day into fiber.\\nSpecifically, Sugar-to-Fiber produces an enzyme called levansucrase, which breaks down molecules of a sugar called sucrose (also known as table sugar) and uses the components as building blocks to create a fiber called levan (a prebiotic fiber that is rare in most diets).\\n### How does Sugar-to-Fiber work?\\nSugar-to-Fiber contains a genetically engineered probiotic, _Bacillus subtilis_ ZB423™,that takes a sugar called sucrose (table sugar) and uses it to create a fiber called levan. It does this by producing an enzyme called levansucrase. \\nWhen you mix Sugar-to-Fiber into your drink, the probiotic bacteria are naturally dormant and in a protective state called an endospore. The bacteria in this endospore form can travel safely through your stomach and make it to the intestines, where they will “wake up” and start producing the enzyme levansucrase. This enzyme is capable of breaking down the sucrose you consume into its two individual molecular components: glucose and fructose. It then strings together the free fructose molecules into long chains to make molecules of levan fiber. \\nRemember: at a molecular level, fibers are just long strings of simple sugars, but their different structures totally change how your body interacts with them. Levan is a rare and beneficial fiber that supports a healthy and diverse microbiome.\\n### What are the benefits of Sugar-to-Fiber?\\nThe primary benefits of Sugar-to-Fiber relate to **microbiome health**. Sugar-to-Fiber is unlikely to break down enough sugar to impact things like caloric intake, blood sugar, or weight. \\nBut it will impact your gut health. Sugar-to-Fiber provides exactly what we know makes your microbiome healthier: \\n  1. More soluble fiber,\\n  2. More fiber diversity,\\n  3. Gradual delivery of fiber throughout the day, and\\n  4. Diversion of intestinal sugar\\n\\n\\nAnd the benefits of a healthier microbiome for your body are vast and vary from person to person: better immune function, improved gut-lining integrity, improved bowel function, increased short-chain fatty acid synthesis, better nutrient utilization, improved energy, psychological benefits such as greater desire to exercise and cravings for healthier foods, and more.*\\n* These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

We are excited to announce that we have launched our second product and now have two products, built with the same technology but for different purposes:\\n**ZBiotics® Pre-Alcohol**⟨40⟩\\n**For easier mornings after drinking.**\\nOur original product, built to help you land on your feet the day after drinking alcohol by breaking down an unwanted byproduct called acetaldehyde while you drink and while you sleep—setting you up for a great next morning.\\n**ZBiotics® Sugar-to-Fiber**⟨41⟩\\n**For turning sugar into fiber in your gut**\\nOur second product, newly launched to help you make the most of a modern diet by converting sugar you eat into fiber in your gut, gently and all day long—improving microbiome health.\\n### What is ZBiotics® Pre-Alcohol Probiotic Drink?\\nZBiotics Pre-Alcohol (or Pre-Alcohol for short) is a beverage containing a patented, genetically engineered probiotic (_B. subtilis_ ZB183™) that helps you land on your feet the day after drinking alcohol. It’s engineered to break down an unwanted byproduct of alcohol called acetaldehyde – the main culprit behind rough mornings after drinking (citation⟨42⟩).\\n### How does Pre-Alcohol work?\\nPre-Alcohol is designed to replicate the natural process of your liver, but do it in your gut. We took a normal probiotic bacteria you already eat every day, and we bioengineered it to produce the same type of enzyme your liver produces (citation⟨43⟩). That enzyme breaks down acetaldehyde – an unwanted byproduct of alcohol that accumulates in your gut when you drink.\\nYour liver does not have access to your gut. But by drinking Pre-Alcohol, the goal is to augment your gut’s natural ability to digest acetaldehyde while you drink and while you sleep – helping you make the most of the next day. Just remember that Pre-Alcohol won’t affect intoxication or make alcohol safer to drink, so always drink responsibly.Learn more about how Pre-Alcohol works.⟨44⟩\\n### What is ZBiotics Sugar-to-Fiber Probiotic Drink Mix?\\nZBiotics Sugar-to-Fiber (or “Sugar-to-Fiber” for short) is a drink mix containing a patented, genetically engineered probiotic (_B. subtilis_ ZB423™) that converts a small amount of the sugar you eat every day into fiber.\\nSpecifically, Sugar-to-Fiber produces an enzyme called levansucrase, which breaks down molecules of a sugar called sucrose (also known as table sugar) and uses the components as building blocks to create a fiber called levan (a prebiotic fiber that is rare in most diets).\\n### How does Sugar-to-Fiber work?\\nSugar-to-Fiber contains a genetically engineered probiotic, _Bacillus subtilis_ ZB423™,that takes a sugar called sucrose (table sugar) and uses it to create a fiber called levan. It does this by producing an enzyme called levansucrase. \\nWhen you mix Sugar-to-Fiber into your drink, the probiotic bacteria are naturally dormant and in a protective state called an endospore. The bacteria in this endospore form can travel safely through your stomach and make it to the intestines, where they will “wake up” and start producing the enzyme levansucrase. This enzyme is capable of breaking down the sucrose you consume into its two individual molecular components: glucose and fructose. It then strings together the free fructose molecules into long chains to make molecules of levan fiber. \\nRemember: at a molecular level, fibers are just long strings of simple sugars, but their different structures totally change how your body interacts with them. Levan is a rare and beneficial fiber that supports a healthy and diverse microbiome.\\n### What are the benefits of Sugar-to-Fiber?\\nThe primary benefits of Sugar-to-Fiber relate to **microbiome health**. Sugar-to-Fiber is unlikely to break down enough sugar to impact things like caloric intake, blood sugar, or weight. \\nBut it will impact your gut health. Sugar-to-Fiber provides exactly what we know makes your microbiome healthier: \\n  1. More soluble fiber,\\n  2. More fiber diversity,\\n  3. Gradual delivery of fiber throughout the day, and\\n  4. Diversion of intestinal sugar\\n\\n\\nAnd the benefits of a healthier microbiome for your body are vast and vary from person to person: better immune function, improved gut-lining integrity, improved bowel function, increased short-chain fatty acid synthesis, better nutrient utilization, improved energy, psychological benefits such as greater desire to exercise and cravings for healthier foods, and more.*\\n* These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
