  "generated_description": "Wren is a forward-thinking startup based in San Francisco, founded in 2019 as part of Y Combinator's S19 batch. At its core, Wren is on a mission to help individuals and businesses offset their carbon footprints through a simple monthly subscription model. The aim is to demystify carbon offsetting and make climate action accessible and straightforward for everyone.\n\nThe platform allows users to calculate their carbon emissions with an intuitive calculator, fund vetted climate projects that make a real impact, and track the difference they're making in the world. Whether you're an individual looking to reduce your emissions, a business seeking to meet sustainability targets, or a philanthropist aiming to contribute strategically to climate efforts, Wren has tailored solutions for each group.\n\nWren’s approach is rooted in transparency and measurable results. They meticulously vet projects based on stringent criteria to ensure that the offsets are both impactful and credible. Projects vary from reforestation and biochar production to innovative climate policies and direct air capture. Each month, subscribers receive updates on the projects they support, providing clarity on their contributions.\n\nWith a team of around 10 talented individuals, Wren has attracted a significant user base, having helped fund over $15 million in climate projects while keeping meticulous track of the tons of CO2 avoided or removed from the atmosphere. This transparency resonates with their users, resulting in high ratings and positive reviews from customers who appreciate Wren's honest approach in an industry often viewed with skepticism.\n\nSo if you’re looking to make a difference but don’t know where to start, Wren provides a clear path from calculation to action. Visit [Wren](https://www.wren.co) to discover how you can join the fight against climate change and be part of the solution today."
