  "description": "Today the building design process is cumbersome and expensive. Architects submit their design to structural engineers for validation. Engineers need to design all structural elements such as walls, columns, and beams to ensure the structure will not collapse and complies with regulations.  The structural engineer needs four to six weeks to generate the initial solution. The engineer will submit his proposal to the architect and then engage in an extensive back and forth discussion until they agree on a satisfying solution. TANGObuilder generates the building structural design in real-time, cutting six weeks of the overall process, and reducing material usage by 30%.",

  "generated_description": "**TANGObuilder**\n\nTANGObuilder is revolutionizing the structural engineering process by automating what has traditionally been a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Founded in 2019 and hailing from the Y Combinator Batch S20, this San Francisco-based company is determined to streamline building design.\n\nThe problem they’re tackling is straightforward but critical: architects submit complex designs to structural engineers, who must then painstakingly draft the structural elements—walls, beams, columns—to ensure safety and compliance with regulations. This back-and-forth usually takes about 4 to 6 weeks, a significant bottleneck in the design process. TANGObuilder uses innovative technology to generate structural designs in real-time. This not only slashes the initial drafting time but also reduces material usage by 30%—a win-win for efficiency and sustainability.\n\nWith a small but capable team of nine, TANGObuilder is well-positioned to push the boundaries of how buildings are designed and constructed. Their impact on the construction and housing industry stands to be significant, especially as they continue to evolve their offerings.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing how they operate or want to learn more, check out their website at [TANGObuilder](https://www.tangobuilder.com).\n\nOverall, TANGObuilder exemplifies how technology can simplify complex processes, making life easier for engineers and, ultimately, leading to better building practices. Keep an eye on them; they’re just getting started."
