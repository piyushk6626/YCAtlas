  "generated_description": "**rct AI: The Future of Intelligent Gaming NPCs**\n\nFounded in 2018 and hailing from Los Angeles, CA, rct AI is on a mission to revolutionize the gaming industry with advanced AI solutions, specifically through the creation of intelligent Non-Playable Characters (NPCs). The company was incubated in Y Combinator's Batch W19, showcasing its potential early on.\n\nThe founders, who previously built and sold Raventech to Baidu in 2017, spearhead a team of 40 passionate individuals. They utilize cutting-edge technologies like deep learning and reinforcement learning to produce a dynamic and engaging user experience, both for gamers and developers alike.\n\n**What’s Cooking at rct AI?**\nrct AI is at the forefront of several intriguing projects:\n- **Chaos Box:** This platform showcases their advancements in motion prediction and key technologies underlying their AI solutions.\n- **Soularis:** A collaboration with NGCOMIC to create a virtual society where users and AI beings coexist, paving the way for digital identities and asset exchange in the web3 era.\n- **Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils 2:** With their decentralized AI platform, players can interact with uniquely responsive characters, creating a truly immersive experience.\n\nAdditionally, they made headlines with their groundbreaking research in deep reinforcement learning, with their ACAR algorithm being recognized in significant IEEE conferences.\n\n**Funding & Growth**\nIn November 2021, rct AI successfully raised over $10 million in their Series A-3 funding, attracting top investors from the gaming, AI, and blockchain sectors globally. This financial backing will accelerate their growth as they work to implement the world's first intelligent NFT and build an unparalleled AAA play-to-earn game.\n\nWith a strong foundation, innovative technology, and a clear vision, rct AI is poised to reshape the landscape of both gaming and the emergent metaverse.\n\nFor more insights and updates, you can visit their [website](http://rct.ai) or follow them on [Twitter](http://rct.ai/<https:/twitter.com/rct_ai>) and [YouTube](http://rct.ai/<https:/www.youtube.com/channel/UC4oB-sPbNuatqjBgex3WKtA>)."
