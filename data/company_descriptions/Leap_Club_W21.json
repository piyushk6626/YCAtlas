Check our FAQs.\\n### About Us\\n[Who are the founders?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nDivish graduated from IIT-Delhi in 2015 and has been working in the domains of farming, food and sustainability since then. Before founding Swadesi Way, he volunteered in Auroville for two years, which significantly shaped his worldview. He is committed to personal growth and actively practices Non-Violent Communication and Yoga.\\nRaj used to be a filmmaker, but around 27, a sudden realisation of planet and farmer exploitation knocked him off his feet. Suddenly, movies didn’t seem to matter much. He turned towards creating conscious organisations. But deep down, he’s still an artist and brings his creative touch to everything he does at Swadesi Way.\\n[What are Swadesi Way’s core values?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\n**Health & Wellbeing**We’re dedicated to helping everyone feel their best, inside and out.\\n**Sustainability & Planet Care**We’re committed to preserving our planet and caring for its future.\\n**Supporting small farmers** We’re backing farmer collectives. They’re crucial for India’s villages.\\n**Collaboration & Unity**It’s all about working together and uniting for positive change!\\n[Where can I see the company’s progress & stats?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nWe want to be completely transparent about our successes and failures so that everyone has an opportunity to learn and contribute.\\nWe will soon start sharing updates about our progress with the community. 🙂\\n### About Organic Food\\n[What does \\'organic\\' really mean?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nA food can be called organic if it’s produced in harmony with nature and without the use of synthetic chemicals, pesticides or genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\\nBefore all the modern industrial farming kicked off, organic farming was just how things were done. Our great-great-great-great (you get the idea) grandparents were all about using what nature gave them to grow their crops.\\nSo, organic farming isn’t a new fad in town. It is the OG way to farm.\\n[Is organic food healthier than food grown with chemicals?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nThis question deserves a long answer but we will keep it short for now.\\nYes, organic food is generally considered healthier than food grown with chemicals. It may reduce your exposure to pesticide residues, toxic metals and other harmful chemicals. They also generally contain higher levels of antioxidants and certain micronutrients, such as vitamin C, zinc, and iron.\\nIn India, the nutritional value of our food has declined significantly over the [past 50 years](https://leapclub.in/<https:/www.downtoearth.org.in/news/food/silent-famine-has-india-weakened-its-own-nutritional-security--93956>). Bringing it back to original levels would require a complete transformation of our food system and growing food organically will be one of the key drivers in this transition.\\nAlso, organic food is equivalent of a healthy balanced diet for our Mother Earth. The food we consume is not just a product of the Earth, but a reflection of its wellbeing. The healthier the planet, the healthier the produce, and in turn, the healthier we are.\\n[Why is organic food more expensive?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nOne of the major reason is lack of demand. Less people eating organic food means that it costs more to bring food from farm to your table. Often, brands also charge a ‘premium’ because it’s still considered a niche.\\nAnother big reason why conventional food is cheaper is because farmers are exploited through grossly unfair payments.\\nBut when you buy from us, 60% of what you pay goes to the farmer collectives. No premium pricing here. And if more consumers join, then the costs will come down and it will make organic food affordable for all. \\nIf you’re choosing our organic food today despite the higher price, you’re helping to create a world where organic food is affordable without exploiting our planet and those who grow it. Let’s build this world together? 🙂\\n### Ordering On Swadesi Way\\n[How can I place the order?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nYou can place the order through our website or through our official WhatsApp number. We provide a seamless experience through both mediums.\\n[Why are some products marked as \\'Not Yet Swadesi Way\\'?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nSome of our products are 100% organic but not yet directly sourced from farmer collectives. These products are labelled as ‘Not Yet Swadesi Way’.\\nWe label them differently because we wish to be completely transparent with you about the source of your food and the impact you are creating by choosing our products.\\nWe put a lot of effort in building long-term relationships with our farmer collectives and hence, it takes time. We will soon be able to offer a complete range of essential organic groceries from our partner collectives.\\nYour support in choosing these products helps us advance towards our goal of creating a sustainable future for India’s villages.\\n[How long do you take to deliver?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nWe do next-day delivery in entire Delhi-NCR through our own delivery team.\\nIf you are ordering from other parts of the country, then it may take 2-5 days based on your location. You will get a tracking link through which you can track your order.\\n[Do you accept cash on delivery?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nYes, we accept cash on delivery. You can also pay online at the time of delivery.\\nBut we recommend that you pay beforehand as it will reduce last-minute inconvenience for both you and our delivery person.\\n[What is the refund policy?](https://leapclub.in/<#>)\\nWe offer refunds if you’re dissatisfied with our product. Occasionally, we’ll request a phone call to better address your concerns. \\nPlease read the product description and storage tips before purchasing.

Check our FAQs.\\n### About Us\\nWho are the founders?⟨4⟩\\nDivish graduated from IIT-Delhi in 2015 and has been working in the domains of farming, food and sustainability since then. Before founding Swadesi Way, he volunteered in Auroville for two years, which significantly shaped his worldview. He is committed to personal growth and actively practices Non-Violent Communication and Yoga.\\nRaj used to be a filmmaker, but around 27, a sudden realisation of planet and farmer exploitation knocked him off his feet. Suddenly, movies didn’t seem to matter much. He turned towards creating conscious organisations. But deep down, he’s still an artist and brings his creative touch to everything he does at Swadesi Way.\\nWhat are Swadesi Way’s core values?⟨4⟩\\n**Health & Wellbeing**We’re dedicated to helping everyone feel their best, inside and out.\\n**Sustainability & Planet Care**We’re committed to preserving our planet and caring for its future.\\n**Supporting small farmers** We’re backing farmer collectives. They’re crucial for India’s villages.\\n**Collaboration & Unity**It’s all about working together and uniting for positive change!\\nWhere can I see the company’s progress & stats?⟨4⟩\\nWe want to be completely transparent about our successes and failures so that everyone has an opportunity to learn and contribute.\\nWe will soon start sharing updates about our progress with the community. 🙂\\n### About Organic Food\\nWhat does \\'organic\\' really mean?⟨4⟩\\nA food can be called organic if it’s produced in harmony with nature and without the use of synthetic chemicals, pesticides or genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\\nBefore all the modern industrial farming kicked off, organic farming was just how things were done. Our great-great-great-great (you get the idea) grandparents were all about using what nature gave them to grow their crops.\\nSo, organic farming isn’t a new fad in town. It is the OG way to farm.\\nIs organic food healthier than food grown with chemicals?⟨4⟩\\nThis question deserves a long answer but we will keep it short for now.\\nYes, organic food is generally considered healthier than food grown with chemicals. It may reduce your exposure to pesticide residues, toxic metals and other harmful chemicals. They also generally contain higher levels of antioxidants and certain micronutrients, such as vitamin C, zinc, and iron.\\nIn India, the nutritional value of our food has declined significantly over the past 50 years⟨36⟩. Bringing it back to original levels would require a complete transformation of our food system and growing food organically will be one of the key drivers in this transition.\\nAlso, organic food is equivalent of a healthy balanced diet for our Mother Earth. The food we consume is not just a product of the Earth, but a reflection of its wellbeing. The healthier the planet, the healthier the produce, and in turn, the healthier we are.\\nWhy is organic food more expensive?⟨4⟩\\nOne of the major reason is lack of demand. Less people eating organic food means that it costs more to bring food from farm to your table. Often, brands also charge a ‘premium’ because it’s still considered a niche.\\nAnother big reason why conventional food is cheaper is because farmers are exploited through grossly unfair payments.\\nBut when you buy from us, 60% of what you pay goes to the farmer collectives. No premium pricing here. And if more consumers join, then the costs will come down and it will make organic food affordable for all. \\nIf you’re choosing our organic food today despite the higher price, you’re helping to create a world where organic food is affordable without exploiting our planet and those who grow it. Let’s build this world together? 🙂\\n### Ordering On Swadesi Way\\nHow can I place the order?⟨4⟩\\nYou can place the order through our website or through our official WhatsApp number. We provide a seamless experience through both mediums.\\nWhy are some products marked as \\'Not Yet Swadesi Way\\'?⟨4⟩\\nSome of our products are 100% organic but not yet directly sourced from farmer collectives. These products are labelled as ‘Not Yet Swadesi Way’.\\nWe label them differently because we wish to be completely transparent with you about the source of your food and the impact you are creating by choosing our products.\\nWe put a lot of effort in building long-term relationships with our farmer collectives and hence, it takes time. We will soon be able to offer a complete range of essential organic groceries from our partner collectives.\\nYour support in choosing these products helps us advance towards our goal of creating a sustainable future for India’s villages.\\nHow long do you take to deliver?⟨4⟩\\nWe do next-day delivery in entire Delhi-NCR through our own delivery team.\\nIf you are ordering from other parts of the country, then it may take 2-5 days based on your location. You will get a tracking link through which you can track your order.\\nDo you accept cash on delivery?⟨4⟩\\nYes, we accept cash on delivery. You can also pay online at the time of delivery.\\nBut we recommend that you pay beforehand as it will reduce last-minute inconvenience for both you and our delivery person.\\nWhat is the refund policy?⟨4⟩\\nWe offer refunds if you’re dissatisfied with our product. Occasionally, we’ll request a phone call to better address your concerns. \\nPlease read the product description and storage tips before purchasing. This will help you determine whether the product aligns with your preferences.\\nPS: Our complaint rate is less than 0.5%.

  "generated_description": "**Leap Club: Bringing Organic to Your Doorstep**\n\nFounded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's W21 batch, Leap Club is on a mission to revolutionize how India accesses healthy, organic groceries. Based in Delhi, this vibrant startup aims to create a curated marketplace that connects consumers with locally-sourced, pesticide-free food directly from vetted farmers. \n\nLeap Club started with a simple but powerful idea: let's put farmer's markets online. The premise is straightforward: you're busy, and buying healthy food shouldn't be a hassle. With just a few clicks, you can order everything from Kashmiri dry fruits to wood-pressed oils and have it delivered to your door within 12 hours of harvesting or baking. This not only ensures freshness but also supports sustainable farming practices and gives back to the communities that produce these goods.\n\nThe founders, Divish and Raj, are committed to empowering small farmer collectives, effectively transforming rural lives through fair trade and organic agriculture. They believe that by leveraging technology, they can guide consumers to make better choices that are good for both their health and the planet. \n\nLeap Club presents a range of products, including:\n- Kashmiri Dry Fruits\n- Desi Dals\n- Wood Pressed Oils \n- Slow Chakki Aata\n- Spices and Sweeteners\n\nWith a dedicated team of 8, they offer free shipping on orders above Rs. 500 and next-day delivery across the Delhi NCR. Their approach combines mindful consumption with the promotion of local organic farming, making it easier than ever for consumers to choose healthy options.\n\nA notable aspect of Leap Club is its commitment to information transparency. They are clear about how their supply chains work, ensuring that a significant portion of the price goes directly to the farmers. This creates a win-win for everyone involved, from consumers to the farmers themselves.\n\nIf you’re interested in supporting a sustainable food revolution while stocking your pantry with nutritious, organic food, check them out at [leapclub.in](https://leapclub.in). It’s not just about consuming; it’s about being part of a larger, meaningful change. Welcome to the Swadesi Way!"
