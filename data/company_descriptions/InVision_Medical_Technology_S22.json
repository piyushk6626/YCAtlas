Our models have been tightly integrated into the clinical workflow to allow easy usage by clinicians. Our work has previously been peer-reviewed and published in several top medical venues, including Nature (2020), Nature Medicine (2021), Lancet Digital Health (2021), JAMA Cardiology (2022). Results from our blinded and randomized clinical trial on evaluating cardiac function have also been recently presented as a Late Breaking Clinical Trial at the European Society of Cardiology.",
