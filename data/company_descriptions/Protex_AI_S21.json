  "description": "Tl;dr: We’re building software that monitors existing cameras in the port, logistics, and manufacturing industries to ensure compliance and identify safety issues.\r\n\nAt Protex AI, we’re on a mission to protect the industrial workforce! We’re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.\r\n\n🤕 The Problem:\r\nKeeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.\r\n\nSerious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.\r\n\n✅ Problem Solved:\r\nProtex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.\r\n\nThe platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.\r\n\nProtex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.\r\n\nHS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.\r\n\nThe tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place.",

If you have any question in particular that you need answered please don't hesitate to contact us.\\nHow can AI help identify hazards and prevent them?\\nAI-powered predictive analytics can be used to detect patterns of risk over time by collecting data from various sources such as CCTV, wearables, or IoT devices. AI technology can also be used for real-time risk assessment in hazardous environments. This technology uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze video streams from cameras installed in hazardous areas and detect any potential risks or unsafe behaviors that could lead to injury or illness. Another way AI helps with hazard prevention is through automated compliance monitoring. By using AI-powered systems such as natural language processing (NLP), organizations can automate the process of monitoring regulatory standards and requirements related to safety policies and procedures.\\nHow to identify hazards in the workplace?\\nThe first step in identifying workplace hazards is to conduct regular inspections of the area. This should include physical inspections as well as reviewing any relevant safety data, such as accident reports and near-miss incidents.This involves examining any potential exposure employees may have to hazardous materials or environments and taking steps to reduce that exposure.An assessment of potential psychological issues that employees may face must also be included. AI powered computer vision solutions integrate with CCTV infrastructures to help identify hazards autonomously across various working environments.\\nHow do I prevent false positives in near miss reporting?\\nThe first step in preventing false positives is clearly defining what constitutes a near miss. Your organization should have a working definition of the term and specific criteria for what qualifies as a near miss incident. In order for reporting systems to work properly and avoid false positives, employees need training on how to report an incident correctly. Another way to reduce false positives is by regularly reviewing errors in your reports. This means looking out for duplicates or inaccurately categorized incidents in your reports, identifying trends or patterns in reported errors, and taking corrective action where needed.\\nHow to prevent workplace accidents and injuries?\\nThe first step in preventing workplace accidents and injuries is establishing a clear safety policy. This policy should outline specific expectations related to safety, including how employees should behave while on the job. The next step is to identify potential risks in the workplace and to take appropriate steps to mitigate or control these risks. Employees must also receive adequate training for prevent any workplace accidents, thus reducing the likelihood of injuries.\\nHow to prevent electrical accidents in the workplace?\\nOne of the most important aspects of preventing electrical accidents is ensuring that all employees are educated on the potential dangers of electricity. It’s also important for employers to ensure that all electrical equipment is properly maintained and inspected on a regular basis. Employees should also be trained on proper use of any electrically-powered equipment they may encounter in their work environment. They should be aware of any safety features built into the machine such as ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) which can help prevent electrocution in case something goes wrong.\\nWhat are the tools used to identify hazards in the workplace?\\nHere are some common tools that can be used to identify hazards in the workplace: Risk assessment matrix: This tool helps EHS teams identify hazards and prioritize them based on their severity and likelihood of occurrence. The matrix has two axes—one for identifying the severity of an accident, and the other for the likelihood of it happening.Job Safety Analysis: This method works by breaking down a job into its individual components and analyzing each step of the process for any potential risks or dangers that may exist.Checklists: EHS teams can also use a checklist to identify any major hazards. The checklist generally includes a series of points or questions that a supervisor or person in charge must go through.\\nWhat percentage of workplace accidents are preventable?\\nAccording to numerous research studies, up to 99% of accidents can be prevented.

If you have any question in particular that you need answered please don't hesitate to contact us.\\nHow can AI help identify hazards and prevent them?\\nAI-powered predictive analytics can be used to detect patterns of risk over time by collecting data from various sources such as CCTV, wearables, or IoT devices. AI technology can also be used for real-time risk assessment in hazardous environments. This technology uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze video streams from cameras installed in hazardous areas and detect any potential risks or unsafe behaviors that could lead to injury or illness. Another way AI helps with hazard prevention is through automated compliance monitoring. By using AI-powered systems such as natural language processing (NLP), organizations can automate the process of monitoring regulatory standards and requirements related to safety policies and procedures.\\nHow to identify hazards in the workplace?\\nThe first step in identifying workplace hazards is to conduct regular inspections of the area. This should include physical inspections as well as reviewing any relevant safety data, such as accident reports and near-miss incidents.This involves examining any potential exposure employees may have to hazardous materials or environments and taking steps to reduce that exposure.An assessment of potential psychological issues that employees may face must also be included. AI powered computer vision solutions integrate with CCTV infrastructures to help identify hazards autonomously across various working environments.\\nHow do I prevent false positives in near miss reporting?\\nThe first step in preventing false positives is clearly defining what constitutes a near miss. Your organization should have a working definition of the term and specific criteria for what qualifies as a near miss incident. In order for reporting systems to work properly and avoid false positives, employees need training on how to report an incident correctly. Another way to reduce false positives is by regularly reviewing errors in your reports. This means looking out for duplicates or inaccurately categorized incidents in your reports, identifying trends or patterns in reported errors, and taking corrective action where needed.\\nHow to prevent workplace accidents and injuries?\\nThe first step in preventing workplace accidents and injuries is establishing a clear safety policy. This policy should outline specific expectations related to safety, including how employees should behave while on the job. The next step is to identify potential risks in the workplace and to take appropriate steps to mitigate or control these risks. Employees must also receive adequate training for prevent any workplace accidents, thus reducing the likelihood of injuries.\\nHow to prevent electrical accidents in the workplace?\\nOne of the most important aspects of preventing electrical accidents is ensuring that all employees are educated on the potential dangers of electricity. It’s also important for employers to ensure that all electrical equipment is properly maintained and inspected on a regular basis. Employees should also be trained on proper use of any electrically-powered equipment they may encounter in their work environment. They should be aware of any safety features built into the machine such as ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) which can help prevent electrocution in case something goes wrong.\\nWhat are the tools used to identify hazards in the workplace?\\nHere are some common tools that can be used to identify hazards in the workplace: Risk assessment matrix: This tool helps EHS teams identify hazards and prioritize them based on their severity and likelihood of occurrence. The matrix has two axes—one for identifying the severity of an accident, and the other for the likelihood of it happening.Job Safety Analysis: This method works by breaking down a job into its individual components and analyzing each step of the process for any potential risks or dangers that may exist.Checklists: EHS teams can also use a checklist to identify any major hazards. The checklist generally includes a series of points or questions that a supervisor or person in charge must go through.\\nWhat percentage of workplace accidents are preventable?\\nAccording to numerous research studies, up to 99% of accidents can be prevented. In 2021, the National Safety Council reported 4,472 preventable injury-related deaths.\\nView moreView less⟨45⟩\\n![⟨52⟩](https://www.protex.ai/</>)\\nEuropean HQ3 Castle StreetDublinD02 F950⟨53⟩US HQ2261 Market Street#4394San Francisco,CA94114⟨54⟩\\ninfo@protex.ai[](https://www.protex.ai/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/75876016>)\\nVisibility\\nVehicle Control⟨3⟩Ergonomics⟨4⟩Behavioural Safety⟨5⟩Area Control⟨6⟩PPE Detection⟨7⟩Housekeeping⟨8⟩\\nReporting\\nCopilot Gen-Al⟨9⟩Reporting & Workflows⟨10⟩\\nIntegrations\\nCCTV Integrations⟨12⟩EHS Management Systems⟨13⟩BI Integrations⟨14⟩\\nBy industry\\nLogistics & Supply-Chain⟨15⟩Retail & Wholesale⟨16⟩Industrial Manufacturing⟨17⟩Food & Bev Manufacturing⟨18⟩Ports & Maritime⟨19⟩Warehouse⟨20⟩\\nCompany\\nCompany⟨21⟩Product⟨2⟩CareersWe're hiring!⟨22⟩Contact Us⟨55⟩Partnerships⟨24⟩News⟨23⟩\\nResources\\nBlog⟨25⟩Webinars⟨26⟩Whitepapers⟨28⟩Case Studies⟨30⟩Glossary⟨29⟩Guides⟨27⟩\\nTerms Of Use⟨56⟩Privacy Policy⟨57⟩Anti-Harassment Policy⟨58⟩Equal Opportunity Policy⟨59⟩Security & Privacy⟨11⟩\\n# Proactive Safety Powered by AI\\n24/7 unsafe event capture, revolutionizing how enterprise EHS teams make proactive safety decisions.\\nWatch video⟨45⟩Request Demo⟨45⟩\\n**About cookies on this site**\\nWe use cookies to collect and analyse information on site performance and usage, to provide social media features and to enhance and customise content and advertisements.\\nLearn more⟨60⟩\\nShow detailsAllow all cookies\\n**About cookies on this site**\\n❮\\n❯\\n  * Categories⟨61⟩\\n\\n\\nCookies used on the site are categorized and below you can read about each category and allow or deny some or all of them.

  "generated_description": "Protex AI is a forward-thinking startup based in Limerick, Ireland, on a mission to enhance workplace safety in industrial environments through cutting-edge computer vision technology. Founded in 2020 and a member of Y Combinator's S21 batch, Protex AI focuses on transforming how health and safety (EHS) teams identify and manage risks.\n\n### The Challenge\n\nWorkplace safety is a daunting task, especially in high-risk industries like manufacturing and logistics. In the U.S., over 5,000 workplace fatalities occurred in 2019, and injuries cost businesses a staggering $62 billion annually. Most safety measures have been reactive—waiting for incidents to happen before acting.\n\n### The Solution\n\nProtex AI is flipping the script with their innovative platform that acts as a digital guardian angel, using existing CCTV infrastructure to monitor safety compliance in real-time. Their software helps EHS teams translate documentation into actionable insights, automatically auditing facilities for safety risks and compliance issues. This data can be used during safety meetings, audits, and discussions about insurance claims.\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Seamless Integration:** The platform easily integrates with existing camera systems, allowing companies to utilize their current infrastructure without extensive investment.\n   \n2. **Customizable Safety Rules:** EHS teams can tailor safety rules and reporting dashboards to fit unique workplace needs.\n\n3. **Real-Time Insights:** The system provides actionable intelligence on unsafe behaviors and incidents, enabling proactive adjustments to safety protocols.\n\n4. **Empowered Decision-Making:** Through intuitive reporting tools and a Gen-AI feature called Copilot, teams can swiftly identify issues and take corrective actions.\n\n### Impact and Results\n\nProtex AI has demonstrated impressive results with their clients. For example, Marks and Spencer saw an 80% reduction in overall incidents within the first 10 weeks of deploying the system, while a global food distributor reduced area control risks by 76%.\n\n### The Future\n\nAs Protex AI continues to expand and refine their offering—having recently secured $36M in Series B funding—they are poised to make substantial waves in the industrial workplace safety sector. Their vision of a safer workplace aligns seamlessly with the increasing need for proactive safety measures in industries where hazards are prevalent.\n\nYou can learn more about Protex AI and their solutions [here](https://www.protex.ai)."
