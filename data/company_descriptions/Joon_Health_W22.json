By directly involving parents through intuitive tools and real-time data collection, Joon enhances treatment integrity and accountability. Clinicians can monitor progress more effectively, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.\n\n**Feedback from Clinicians and Families**\n\nClinicians are lauding Joon for its ability to bridge the gap between them and the families they serve. Parents, on the other hand, have found the platform transformative—turning what was once an overwhelming process into an engaging experience that children look forward to.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nJoon Health is on a mission to fundamentally change how pediatric behavioral health is managed—transforming consultations into collaborations that genuinely involve families.
