  "description": "At Verse Therapy, we're dedicated to making quality speech therapy accessible for everyone by empowering speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to launch and grow their own independent practices. We help therapists focus on what they do best—providing compassionate, personalized care—by taking care of the administrative tasks that often lead to burnout. Through thoughtful marketing and partnerships with care organizations like rehab centers, we connect SLPs with individuals who need their expertise. Our AI-enabled back office streamlines insurance processing, scheduling, and documentation, reducing non-therapy overhead. We're now live in 10 states with over 35 dedicated therapists and are in-network with leading insurance providers, making it easier for clients to receive the support they need.",

I had a lot of worries, being based in California-how will my child stay engaged through tele-therapy sessions, will her teacher be able to foster that attention from her that is needed for her to improve and will this program be effective? Let me tell you Verse Therapy and Liz were all that and more. Not only was my daughter interested and engaged but in times of difficulty Liz was so patient and encouraging fluidity throughout the session. Verse Therapy’s strategy to incorporate simple tips into our routine has put my child leaps and bounds ahead of where we started.\"\\n![Verse](https://versetherapy.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Frmdche6f%2Fproduction%2F9957060032c85a8031f508f5b4aaf195c1098284-560x665.jpg%3Fw%3D1600%26q%3D100%26fit%3Dmax%26auto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=80)\\nFor Paul McGill\\n\"Paul has been working with my son for over a year now.

Thank you for going above and beyond for my child. It wasn\\'t always easy with my son but you never gave up and kept a positive attitude through it all. You taught my son in a way he could understand. In the beginning my son wasn\\'t able to ask his teachers for help, due to them not understanding him BUT now a year later and thanks to you Liz, he can have a mini conversation.

She truly cares, and this is evident because she makes a point to give attention to what my son’s specific needs are! He often finds therapy difficult to sit through, but with Stephanie, I noted him looking forward to sessions, seeing him enthusiastic during them and excited to complete a task with her.

That\\'s what I found when I connected to my therapist on Verse. For anyone else wondering if they have found the right place, I know I found hope. I can\\'t wait for my next session.\"\\n![Verse⟨25⟩]\\nFor Liz Zyzo\\n\"When I met with Liz for the initial session through Verse Therapy, I was blown away with how kind and thorough the service was. I had a lot of worries, being based in California-how will my child stay engaged through tele-therapy sessions, will her teacher be able to foster that attention from her that is needed for her to improve and will this program be effective? Let me tell you Verse Therapy and Liz were all that and more. Not only was my daughter interested and engaged but in times of difficulty Liz was so patient and encouraging fluidity throughout the session. Verse Therapy’s strategy to incorporate simple tips into our routine has put my child leaps and bounds ahead of where we started.\"\\n![Verse⟨26⟩]\\nFor Paul McGill\\n\"Paul has been working with my son for over a year now. He has always showed up with a smile. He has fully supported my son\\'s needs. He has introduced my son to two different AAC applications. Paul is very knowledgeable and is an open book to support his client and parents. He has answered all of my endless questions. He is transparent, trustworthy, and gently pushes the child out of their comfort zone.\"\\n![Verse⟨27⟩]\\nFor Julie Meyerowitz\\n“As a result of working with Julie, our daughter little by little started saying more and more sounds. She helped facilitate this process and helped our daughter realize what she was capable of, one sound at a time. Now, our daughter doesn\\'t stop talking all day long!” \\n![Verse⟨28⟩]\\nFor Kristen Riley\\n“My son has been working with Ms. Kristen for a few months and I am blown away with the results, confidence and his eagerness to partcipate. She goes above and beyond to be fun, prompt, engaging and it’s something that my child is eager to do and is so beneficial for him. She is amazing at also providing support for the parents and we appreciate her so much. I cannot stress how happy we are that we found her and that my son has the pleasure to work with her.” \\n![Verse⟨29⟩]\\nFor Stephanie Rich\\n“We have seen genuine care for our son’s progress in the short time we have worked with her. Our son is a very busy little boy who is always all over the place. Stephanie is patient and accommodating to what may work best to help our son. Knowing that we are our son’s primary “therapist” since speech therapy is weekly, we appreciate her time teaching us additional tools for working with our little one at home each week. Our family has been part of his growth. We have seen such progress and will always be grateful!”\\n![Verse⟨24⟩]\\nFor Sarah Sponseller\\n\"I\\'m very happy. My voice is sounding a lot better. I think that the Verse set up is wonderful and I\\'m happy to see my progress. Other speech places have said there is nothing I can do, but Sarah has helped me and given me more than anywhere else I\\'ve tried.\" \\n![Verse⟨25⟩]\\nFor Liz Zyzo\\n\"Liz, our family is forever grateful for you. Thank you for going above and beyond for my child. It wasn\\'t always easy with my son but you never gave up and kept a positive attitude through it all. You taught my son in a way he could understand. In the beginning my son wasn\\'t able to ask his teachers for help, due to them not understanding him BUT now a year later and thanks to you Liz, he can have a mini conversation. Perfect for a 3 year old. I would recommend Liz to any other parent trying to better their child’s speech.\"\\n![Verse⟨27⟩]\\nFor Julie Meyerowitz\\n“As a result of working with Julie my children have greatly improved in everyday speech and now speak more clearly. More family members and friends understand them while they are speaking, telling stories of their favorite things or trying to explain something.”\\n![Verse⟨29⟩]\\nFor Stephanie Rich\\n“Stephanie is very thorough and helped my son stay focused and on task, all while making therapy fun and keeping him engaged. She truly cares, and this is evident because she makes a point to give attention to what my son’s specific needs are! He often finds therapy difficult to sit through, but with Stephanie, I noted him looking forward to sessions, seeing him enthusiastic during them and excited to complete a task with her. I was very impressed with this and was extremely happy with his progress. Her methods worked out very quickly and well for him!”\\n## Our team has been featured in:\\n![logo⟨30⟩]\\n![logo⟨31⟩]\\n![logo⟨32⟩]\\n![logo⟨33⟩]\\n![logo⟨30⟩]\\n![logo⟨31⟩]\\n![logo⟨32⟩]\\n![logo⟨33⟩]\\n## How It Works\\nFind a Speech Therapist⟨8⟩\\n![Verse⟨34⟩]\\n01\\nFind a speech therapist.\\nChoose from our team of Verse-Vetted SLPs based on your needs and insurance coverage.\\n![Verse⟨35⟩]\\n02\\nSchedule an evaluation.\\nBook a session instantly to work with your SLP to create a personalized therapy plan tailored to you.\\n![Verse⟨36⟩]\\n03\\nStart your journey.\\nWe’ll fit your schedule and track your progress, with the comfort of knowing your SLP is available for support at any time.\\nWhy We\\'re Better\\nVerse\\nOthers\\n01\\nWait Time\\nYou can start therapy within days.\\nLong wait times.

  "generated_description": "**Verse Therapy: A New Era in Speech Therapy**\n\nFounded in 2024, Verse Therapy is redefining the landscape of speech therapy, driven by the mission of connecting all ages with speech-language pathologists (SLPs). The company is headquartered in San Francisco and is a proud participant of the Y Combinator Batch W24. With a small, dedicated team of just three employees, Verse Therapy is currently operating in ten states and has onboarded over 35 therapists.\n\n### The Vision\n\nAt its core, Verse Therapy seeks to make quality speech therapy accessible to everyone. They empower SLPs to establish and grow their practices, allowing them to focus on what they do best: providing compassionate and personalized care. By taking care of the often-overwhelming administrative tasks—think scheduling, insurance processing, and documentation—Verse Therapy significantly reduces the burnout that many therapists experience.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe platform features an AI-enabled back office that streamlines the business side of therapy. This innovation not only facilitates insurance processing and scheduling, but also enhances documentation practices, enabling therapists to prioritize client interaction. For clients, the process is straightforward: you can expect to start therapy in a matter of days instead of months. \n\n### Affordable and Convenient\n\nVerse Therapy is making strides in reducing the costs associated with speech therapy. Clients typically pay less than half the cost of traditional therapies, as they work with a wide array of insurance providers. Furthermore, they offer self-pay options starting at just $95 per session.\n\n### Services Offered\n\nVerse Therapy caters to a broad range of speech-related issues, including:\n- Speech sound disorders\n- Voice disorders\n- Fluency disorders\n- Cognitive-communication therapy (essential for those recovering from strokes and brain injuries)\n- Gender-affirming voice therapy\n- Public speaking and professional communication strategies\n\nWhether for children or adults, the platform's therapists are equipped to manage various communication challenges. \n\n### Client-Centric Approach\n\nOne of the standout features of Verse Therapy is its commitment to ongoing support. Therapists are accessible outside of scheduled sessions, allowing clients to reach out for additional help when they need it most. This level of accessibility and flexibility is a notable differentiator in the therapy space. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith a clear mission, a smart use of technology, and a focus on affordable care, Verse Therapy is set to change how individuals access speech therapy. By placing therapists and their clients first, they are championing a new paradigm where therapy is not only effective but also approachable for everyone, regardless of age or background. \n\nFor more information, check out their website at [Verse Therapy](https://versetherapy.com)."
