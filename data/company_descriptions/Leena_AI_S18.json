  "description": "HR/IT/Finance professionals spend 50% of their time answering employees' questions and tickets. Itâs even worse on the employee side, they have to wait for a long time for simple answers.\r\n\nWe are live with 500 customers like Coca-Cola, Sony, Puma, Vodafone, Nestle, P&G, Airbnb, etc. We have raised over $40M from top VCs like Bessemer, Greycroft, Elad Gil, etc.\r\n\nLeena AI consumes companyâs enterprise knowledge & starts answering all employee questions just like a human would. It can even answer complex personalized questions like Why is my salary less this month?\r\n\nEmployees can access Leena AI from commonly used UIs like MS Teams or Slack.",
