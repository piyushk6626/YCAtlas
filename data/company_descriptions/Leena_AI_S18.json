  "description": "HR/IT/Finance professionals spend 50% of their time answering employees' questions and tickets. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s even worse on the employee side, they have to wait for a long time for simple answers.\r\n\nWe are live with 500 customers like Coca-Cola, Sony, Puma, Vodafone, Nestle, P&G, Airbnb, etc. We have raised over $40M from top VCs like Bessemer, Greycroft, Elad Gil, etc.\r\n\nLeena AI consumes companyÃ¢Â€Â™s enterprise knowledge & starts answering all employee questions just like a human would. It can even answer complex personalized questions like Why is my salary less this month?\r\n\nEmployees can access Leena AI from commonly used UIs like MS Teams or Slack.",

  "generated_description": "### Leena AI: Revolutionizing Employee Support with AI\n\n**Overview**  \nLeena AI is a cutting-edge virtual assistant designed to streamline employee queries in organizations, specifically in the sectors of HR, IT, and Finance. Founded in the Y Combinator Batch S18, the company started with a simple mission: to save employees from the frustration of waiting for simple answers to their questions. With a remarkable presence that includes heavyweights like Coca-Cola, Sony, and Airbnb among its 500 customers, Leena AI has raised over $40 million from prominent venture capital firms, including Bessemer and Greycroft.\n\n**The Problem**  \nTraditionally, HR, IT, and Finance professionals spend about 50% of their time addressing employee inquiries and managing tickets. For employees, waiting for needed information can be time-consuming and tedious. Leena AI tackles this issue head-on by providing instant responses to employee questions, creating a more efficient workflow and improving the overall employee experience.\n\n**How It Works**  \nLeena AI's technology consumes a companyâ€™s enterprise knowledge, enabling it to respond to queries in a manner similar to that of a human. For instance, it can handle specialized questions like \"Why is my salary less this month?\"â€”providing tailored responses that meet individual employee needs. \n\nEmployees can engage with Leena AI via popular platforms like MS Teams and Slackâ€”an integration that enhances usability and ease of access.\n\n**Location and Team**  \nBased in Redwood City, CA, Leena AI boasts a strong team of 500 employees working towards transforming enterprise communication and efficiency.\n\n**Product Offerings and Unique Features**  \n- **Agentic AI**: Central to Leena AI's offerings is its Agentic AI technology that allows for a significant 70% self-service guarantee for IT, HR, and Finance tickets. \n- **Multi-channel Support**: The assistant seamlessly integrates with existing employee communication channels, ensuring help is just a click away.\n- **Multilingual Support**: Leena AI caters to diverse teams by offering support in over 100 languages.\n- **Autonomous Agent**: The newest innovation allows for complex task management across multiple applications with just one prompt, streamlining processes that were previously disjointed.\n\n**Security and Compliance**  \nUnderstanding the importance of data security, Leena AI complies with EU AI Act standards and ensures that customer data is never used to train its models, promoting trust among its users.\n\n**Recognition**  \nThe company has received accolades from industry leaders, appearing in Gartner's Hype Cycle reports and being recognized in several categories including Virtual Support Agents and AI Applications for IT Service Management.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nIn a world where efficiency is crucial, Leena AI stands out as a robust solution for organizations looking to enhance their employee experience. With continuous innovations and a strong commitment to security and user satisfaction, Leena AI is not just simplifying processes; itâ€™s transforming how companies engage with their employees.\n\nFor more information, visit [Leena AI](https://www.leena.ai)."
