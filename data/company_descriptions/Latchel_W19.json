  "generated_description": "Latchel is shaking up the property management scene with a sleek end-to-end platform that's all about resident experience and maintenance automation. Founded in 2016 and part of Y Combinator's Winter 2019 batch, this Seattle-based company has grown rapidly, now serving over 80,000 homes across the United States. \n\nAt the core of Latchel’s mission is to deliver a 24/7 emergency maintenance department tailored for property managers. They equip their clients with tools to handle maintenance intake, emergency support, work order tracking, and even invoicing and reporting—all while ensuring residents receive top-notch amenities and experiences.\n\nTheir approach is two-fold: they simplify the management side, reducing time spent on endless coordination, while simultaneously enhancing the resident's interaction with services. With features aimed at boosting resident retention, such as direct communication with maintenance experts and a user-friendly interface, Latchel takes on the burden of property maintenance, allowing property managers to focus on growth instead of firefighting.\n\nLatchel is also keen on turning maintenance costs into ancillary revenue. They achieve this by offering residents credits for damages and care services which improve satisfaction and retention. For those on the lookout for a position, the company is on the hunt for a Product Designer to continue their momentum.\n\nWith a dedicated team behind it, and a vision that puts residents at the forefront, Latchel is not just another SaaS company—it’s positioning itself as a vital partner for property managers who recognize the importance of a stellar resident experience. For more details, you can check out [Latchel's website](http://latchel.com). \n\nIn a nutshell, Latchel aims to transform routine maintenance into moments that residents love, paving the way for smoother operations and strengthened relationships for property managers."
