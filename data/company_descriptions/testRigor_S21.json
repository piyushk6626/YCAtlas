Tests are automatically generated based on our AI\\'s mirroring of how your end users are using your application in your production environment. In addition, tests are produced to map your most important functionality out of the box. This is achieved by using our JavaScript library in your production environment to capture metadata around your users\\' habits within your app. We use this metadata to automatically generate & maintain behavior-driven tests for your most frequently used functionality & flows. We also add the possibility for tests of most important functionality based on common and industry-specific rules.\\n2. Our tests are in [plain English](https://testrigor.com/</docs/language>), so it is possible to understand what is being tested and to search for all tests affecting certain buttons, inputs, etc. Using the same language support, you can also customize rules to fit your own internal verbiage.\\n3. Because testRigor tests are not dependent on XPath, they are ultra-stable. Our customers are running thousands of tests multiple times a day without a single failure.\\n4. Our tests are adaptable. We not only extract and show unique issues, but we also identify and group together all the cases affected by the same issue and allow our customers to fix them in place all at once with quick and easy editing tools.\\nHow are you different from Cucumber/Gherkin?\\nYou can think of testRigor as Cucumber already implemented for your project. We have eliminated the need to write and maintain any underlying Selenium code, as our system uses an NLP-based parser to parse plain English and executes your specifications in place.\\nWhat are your end-to-end tests actually testing for?\\nAcceptance-level functional UI-level regression tests. We test that functionality works via UI. For example, for Amazon we would test that a person can successfully purchase a product from log in to purchase confirmation.\\nWhat do you test well?\\nOur system is particularly adept at testing form-based UI or functionality that has a predictable input/output. A few other strengths unique to our tool are... 1. ...cases that require multiple users to interact be the same flow be it via email, SMS, or instant messages. 2. ...cases built for platforms with constantly changing code and HTML IDs. 3. ...complex flows that need to combine actions like image comparison, audio quality, dragging & dropping all into one.\\nWhat don\\'t you test well?\\nWe don\\'t test games.\\n[Read More](https://testrigor.com/</faq/>)\\n## Software Testing Tool\\nTest automation simplified\\n![](https://testrigor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/deploy-faster.png)\\nDeploy faster with more stable tests\\nGet to production in hours instead of weeks.\\ntestRigor tests work as long as your specifications in plain English remain true.\\ntestRigor is ideal for CI/CD because testRigor tests won’t fail unless functionality changes.\\n![](https://testrigor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/reduce-qa-headache.png)\\nReduce QA headaches and make your team happy\\nStart testing within minutes.\\nfree your QA team from manual click-through regression testing and maintaining automated scripts.\\nRefocus your test team to work on other more meaningful testing initiatives.\\n![](https://testrigor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/29.png)\\nAdapt to new functionality with ease\\nEliminate repetitive work.\\nSurvive UI framework changes\\ntestRigor extracts unique issues from all tests.\\nAdapt to new changes with a few clicks of a button and a few plain-English words.\\nNO CODE / CODELESS\\n## Test Automation Tool\\nThe only end-to-end test automation tool you’ll ever need. testRigor empowers the whole team to write end-to-end UI tests quickly and efficiently.

This means identifying elements as you see them on the screen instead of using element locators. And the tests are so stable that some of our customers even use them for monitoring. These are just a few benefits of the testRigor test automation tool.\\n![Test Automation Tool](https://testrigor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/test-automation-tool-codeless-img.png)\\nSpecial Features\\nWrite Complex Tests In Plain English\\nObliterate Test Maintenance\\nAutomate Your Tests 100X Faster\\nEnable Team Scaling\\nby using one of the best\\n## software testing tools\\non the market\\nScale your software engineering teams by allowing them to focus on what matters instead of being bogged down with mundane test maintenance.

Tests are automatically generated based on our AI\\'s mirroring of how your end users are using your application in your production environment. In addition, tests are produced to map your most important functionality out of the box. This is achieved by using our JavaScript library in your production environment to capture metadata around your users\\' habits within your app. We use this metadata to automatically generate & maintain behavior-driven tests for your most frequently used functionality & flows. We also add the possibility for tests of most important functionality based on common and industry-specific rules.\\n2. Our tests are in plain English⟨52⟩, so it is possible to understand what is being tested and to search for all tests affecting certain buttons, inputs, etc. Using the same language support, you can also customize rules to fit your own internal verbiage.\\n3. Because testRigor tests are not dependent on XPath, they are ultra-stable. Our customers are running thousands of tests multiple times a day without a single failure.\\n4. Our tests are adaptable. We not only extract and show unique issues, but we also identify and group together all the cases affected by the same issue and allow our customers to fix them in place all at once with quick and easy editing tools.\\nHow are you different from Cucumber/Gherkin?\\nYou can think of testRigor as Cucumber already implemented for your project. We have eliminated the need to write and maintain any underlying Selenium code, as our system uses an NLP-based parser to parse plain English and executes your specifications in place.\\nWhat are your end-to-end tests actually testing for?\\nAcceptance-level functional UI-level regression tests. We test that functionality works via UI. For example, for Amazon we would test that a person can successfully purchase a product from log in to purchase confirmation.\\nWhat do you test well?\\nOur system is particularly adept at testing form-based UI or functionality that has a predictable input/output. A few other strengths unique to our tool are... 1. ...cases that require multiple users to interact be the same flow be it via email, SMS, or instant messages. 2. ...cases built for platforms with constantly changing code and HTML IDs. 3. ...complex flows that need to combine actions like image comparison, audio quality, dragging & dropping all into one.\\nWhat don\\'t you test well?\\nWe don\\'t test games.\\nRead More⟨53⟩\\n## Software Testing Tool\\nTest automation simplified\\n![](https://testrigor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/deploy-faster.png)\\nDeploy faster with more stable tests\\nGet to production in hours instead of weeks.\\ntestRigor tests work as long as your specifications in plain English remain true.\\ntestRigor is ideal for CI/CD because testRigor tests won’t fail unless functionality changes.\\n![](https://testrigor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/reduce-qa-headache.png)\\nReduce QA headaches and make your team happy\\nStart testing within minutes.\\nfree your QA team from manual click-through regression testing and maintaining automated scripts.\\nRefocus your test team to work on other more meaningful testing initiatives.\\n![](https://testrigor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/29.png)\\nAdapt to new functionality with ease\\nEliminate repetitive work.\\nSurvive UI framework changes\\ntestRigor extracts unique issues from all tests.\\nAdapt to new changes with a few clicks of a button and a few plain-English words.\\nNO CODE / CODELESS\\n## Test Automation Tool\\nThe only end-to-end test automation tool you’ll ever need. testRigor empowers the whole team to write end-to-end UI tests quickly and efficiently. Seamlessly create, edit, and update tests of any complexity, allowing the team to expand test coverage rapidly.\\nUnlike most other codeless test automation tools available on the market, all tests are created entirely from a user’s perspective. This means identifying elements as you see them on the screen instead of using element locators. And the tests are so stable that some of our customers even use them for monitoring. These are just a few benefits of the testRigor test automation tool.\\n![Test Automation Tool⟨54⟩]\\nSpecial Features\\nWrite Complex Tests In Plain English\\nObliterate Test Maintenance\\nAutomate Your Tests 100X Faster\\nEnable Team Scaling\\nby using one of the best\\n## software testing tools\\non the market\\nScale your software engineering teams by allowing them to focus on what matters instead of being bogged down with mundane test maintenance.

  "generated_description": "testRigor is an innovative company founded in 2015 and is a part of Y Combinator's Batch S21. Based in San Francisco with a team of 25 employees, their mission is to simplify test automation by allowing users to write executable specifications in plain English. Essentially, testRigor transforms what traditionally could take a highly technical QA engineer hours into something that can be accomplished swiftly and efficiently by manual QA testers—up to 15 times faster and with 200 times less time spent maintaining code.\n\nThey excel in using AI technologies to automate testing, making it accessible for anyone on the team to contribute. Instead of delving into complicated coding processes, users can specify actions such as \"purchase a Kindle,\" and testRigor translates that into actionable test steps like searching for the product and adding it to the cart. This focus on usability promises increased productivity and reduced maintenance burdens, which many organizations struggle with.\n\nWith over 54,000 companies counting on testRigor, its solutions encompass web testing, mobile testing, desktop testing, and more, using a robust platform that integrates easily with popular tools like GitHub, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps. They prioritize security, following industry standards like SOC2 and HIPAA, ensuring that user data remains confidential.\n\ntestRigor's platform is particularly valuable for those looking to enhance test coverage without the media costs usually associated with more technical solutions. It has garnered recognition as a \"Cool Vendor\" by Gartner in 2023, highlighting its innovative edge in the software engineering sector.\n\nIn summary, testRigor represents a forward-thinking approach to test automation, making it accessible and efficient while resolving some of the core inefficiencies in traditional testing methodologies.
