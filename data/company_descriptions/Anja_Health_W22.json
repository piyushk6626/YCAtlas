Her parents noticed early developmental delays. Then, they agreed to participate in a blinded trial, which started a year and a half ago, involves infusing either cord blood or a placebo, with the conditions revealed only after the second infusion. Following the treatment, it was revealed that she received cord blood, and Allison exhibited significant improvements, particularly in speech, leading to her graduation from speech therapy, offering hope to her parents for further enhancements in her ability to walk and lead a more active, normal life.\\n![children](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622fe41167960612305a1556/65d46a5499b8561b21d4d6ca_Case%206.webp)\\n## New Orleans teen survives cancer thanks to sister\\'s stem cells, shares his story at the Vatican\\nCredits: Nola.com\\nAlthough the survival rate among children with [acute lymphoblastic] leukemia is between 80 percent to 90 percent, Quentin was among a patient population with genetic markers that lowered the survival rate to between 20 to 30 percent. At the time of his diagnosis, she [his mother] was 5 months pregnant with Jory. She gave birth to Jory on Dec. 3, 2007. An obstetrician extracted blood from her umbilical cord and the placenta. The blood was then transported to Celgene to determine whether the siblings were a genetic match. Quentin\\'s system accepted the transplant quickly and he was able to start producing healthy blood cells less than a month after the transplant. He is now 10 years in remission.\\n![kid](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622fe41167960612305a1556/65d36caeaa56c76c88f5b01b_case%203.webp)\\n## Cord Blood Rescue After Cardiac Arrest\\nCredits: Parent\\'s Guide to Cord Blood Foundation\\nA 2.5-year-old boy in Germany, initially healthy, experienced a cardiac arrest, leading to prolonged oxygen deprivation and a persistent vegetative state.

When you give birth, take your collection kit with you. Immediately after birth, your baby\\'s umbilical cord is clamped and cut. A doctor or midwife draws cord blood from the clamped cord into a collection bag. Once you call the number on our collection kit or fill out the pickup form to alert our shipping team that you\\'ve given birth, a medical courier picks up the collection kit and speedily delivers it to a lab. Necessary testing and processing is carried out, and cord blood stem cells are stored in a liquid nitrogen storage tank within a lab facility.\\nCan I freeze it at home?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622fe41167960612305a1556/64b44e028883c0cbf9ec8bca_chevron-blue.svg)\\nNo, maintaining stem cell viability requires careful cryopreservation in extreme temperatures. (-190° Celsius for safe-keeping!)

Umbilical cord blood stem cells are FDA-approved to treat cancers, blood disorders, immune disorders, and metabolic disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, leukemia, and sickle cell anemia. After birth, you have access to a portal where you can view your stem cell certificate and contact us in the case you ever want to retrieve your stem cells. You would need to have a physician ready to receive the stem cells for treatment (generally for a FDA-approved or clinical trial use case). We can get the stem cells to your designated physician shortly after you contact us.\\nWhat should I bank?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622fe41167960612305a1556/64b44e028883c0cbf9ec8bca_chevron-blue.svg)\\nBanking your cord blood, cord tissue, and your placenta gives you the greatest quantity and variety of stem cells for future treatment possibilities.Stem cells are the body\\'s master cells, creating all tissues and organs.

Umbilical cords and placentas have saved the following lives:\\n![kid⟨33⟩]\\n## Clinical trial at Georgia Health Sciences University uses cord blood to ease cerebral palsy symptoms\\nCredits: Augusta Chronicle\\nBefore the clinical trial at Georgia Health Sciences University, 2-year-old Allison Thurman struggled with developmental milestones due to cerebral palsy. Her parents noticed early developmental delays. Then, they agreed to participate in a blinded trial, which started a year and a half ago, involves infusing either cord blood or a placebo, with the conditions revealed only after the second infusion. Following the treatment, it was revealed that she received cord blood, and Allison exhibited significant improvements, particularly in speech, leading to her graduation from speech therapy, offering hope to her parents for further enhancements in her ability to walk and lead a more active, normal life.\\n![children⟨34⟩]\\n## New Orleans teen survives cancer thanks to sister\\'s stem cells, shares his story at the Vatican\\nCredits: Nola.com\\nAlthough the survival rate among children with [acute lymphoblastic] leukemia is between 80 percent to 90 percent, Quentin was among a patient population with genetic markers that lowered the survival rate to between 20 to 30 percent. At the time of his diagnosis, she [his mother] was 5 months pregnant with Jory. She gave birth to Jory on Dec. 3, 2007. An obstetrician extracted blood from her umbilical cord and the placenta. The blood was then transported to Celgene to determine whether the siblings were a genetic match. Quentin\\'s system accepted the transplant quickly and he was able to start producing healthy blood cells less than a month after the transplant. He is now 10 years in remission.\\n![kid⟨35⟩]\\n## Cord Blood Rescue After Cardiac Arrest\\nCredits: Parent\\'s Guide to Cord Blood Foundation\\nA 2.5-year-old boy in Germany, initially healthy, experienced a cardiac arrest, leading to prolonged oxygen deprivation and a persistent vegetative state. Following an infusion of his own cord blood, the child showed remarkable progress over three years. Improvements included motor skills, cognition, and speech.\\n![family⟨36⟩]\\n## Maria\\'s Progress (MS / Neuropathy Patient)\\nCredits: Da Vinci Wellness Centre\\nMaria received a therapy involving mesenchymal stem cells derived from cord tissue. She was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis that caused her to lose full use of her right arm and hand. Only 8 hours after she completed her treatment she was able to open her hand, which she previously could not move at all, and move her fingers, feeling sensation in each finger.\\n![family⟨37⟩]\\n## 6 Year Old Treated with Cord Blood\\nCredits: CBC Health\\nIn November 2017, Sophia experienced a hemorrhagic stroke due to a ruptured Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM). Facing various challenges, including mobility and cognitive issues, she underwent a cord blood treatment in January 2020. As of now, eleven weeks post-transplant, she has shown promising improvements, such as walking without her AFO brace, regaining movement in her left toes and ankle, and demonstrating progress in speech therapy. Our family is optimistic about continued success in the coming months, witnessing positive changes in her mental and physical well-being.\\n![friends⟨38⟩]\\n## Stem Cells Treat 57-Year-Old After Stroke\\nCredits: CBC Health\\nAfter a stroke, my husband faced right-side paralysis, severe apraxia of speech, seizures, and post-stroke pain. Desperate for solutions, we explored cord blood transplants based on Stanford and Duke studies. Days after starting the process, my husband received cord blood stem cell infusions. Remarkably, he has been seizure-free since the treatment, and his pain started subsiding around four weeks post-treatment. Cord blood transplantation brought us hope, an experience we\\'ll treasure for a lifetime.\\n![children⟨39⟩]\\n## Brodie\\'s sibling cord blood therapy for cerebral palsy\\nCredits: Parent\\'s Guide to Cord Blood Foundation\\nBrodie attributes his newfound strength to one source: \"Zoey\\'s blood.\" This profound statement encapsulates the transformative impact of the sibling cord blood treatment he underwent in December 2018 for his left hemiplegia cerebral palsy. Before the groundbreaking therapy, Brodie faced challenges such as irregularities in movements and uneven strength in his left side, a result of a stroke in the womb. However, as one of the pioneering recipients of the sibling cord blood treatment in Australia, Brodie\\'s life took a positive turn. Brodie\\'s parents observed substantial improvements following the sibling cord blood treatment, including increased movement and strength in his left arm, marking a notable enhancement in his daily life.\\n![family⟨40⟩]\\n## Kamsiyochukwu Cured of Sickle Cell by Cord Blood Transplant\\nCredits: Parent\\'s Guide to Cord Blood Foundation\\nKamsiyochukwu and his family are from Nigeria, but they were living in India when he was diagnosed with Sickle Cell Anaemia at the age of two years old in 2013. Kamsiyochukwu’s mother, Blessing Ezenwa, learned from her son’s doctors that a stem cell transplant from a sibling could stop his pain crises and cure his Sickle Cell. She gave birth to a second son in 2018 and stored his cord blood with Cordlife Sciences India. Then in January of 2020, Kamsiyochukwu underwent chemotherapy at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi and next received a transplant of his baby brother’s cord blood stem cells. His mother says, \"Since then till now, there is no crisis, no pain, no nothing, he is okay.

When you give birth, take your collection kit with you. Immediately after birth, your baby\\'s umbilical cord is clamped and cut. A doctor or midwife draws cord blood from the clamped cord into a collection bag. Once you call the number on our collection kit or fill out the pickup form to alert our shipping team that you\\'ve given birth, a medical courier picks up the collection kit and speedily delivers it to a lab. Necessary testing and processing is carried out, and cord blood stem cells are stored in a liquid nitrogen storage tank within a lab facility.\\nCan I freeze it at home?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622fe41167960612305a1556/64b44e028883c0cbf9ec8bca_chevron-blue.svg)\\nNo, maintaining stem cell viability requires careful cryopreservation in extreme temperatures. (-190° Celsius for safe-keeping!) These stem cells have no known expiration date so we’ll keep them safe as long as you need.\\nHow can I use the stem cells?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622fe41167960612305a1556/64b44e028883c0cbf9ec8bca_chevron-blue.svg)\\nThe umbilical cord is rich with powerful stem cells - hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to be precise. Umbilical cord blood stem cells are FDA-approved to treat cancers, blood disorders, immune disorders, and metabolic disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, leukemia, and sickle cell anemia. After birth, you have access to a portal where you can view your stem cell certificate and contact us in the case you ever want to retrieve your stem cells. You would need to have a physician ready to receive the stem cells for treatment (generally for a FDA-approved or clinical trial use case). We can get the stem cells to your designated physician shortly after you contact us.\\nWhat should I bank?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622fe41167960612305a1556/64b44e028883c0cbf9ec8bca_chevron-blue.svg)\\nBanking your cord blood, cord tissue, and your placenta gives you the greatest quantity and variety of stem cells for future treatment possibilities.Stem cells are the body\\'s master cells, creating all tissues and organs. They can repair, restore, and regenerate cells and offer treatment possibilities for numerous medical conditions. These unique cells can develop into various cell types, from muscle to brain, and are the only type of cell in the body that has the natural ability to generate new cell types.At your birth, we can collect and store Multipotent stem cells from the cord blood, cord tissue, and the placenta. Multipotent stem cells can develop into any cell type within a family of tissues.**Umbilical cord blood** stem cells, Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs), are FDA-approved to treat cancers, blood disorders, immune disorders, and metabolic disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, leukemia, and sickle cell anemia.**The placenta** is rich with Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) and Amniotic Epithelial Cells (AECs). These stem cells have valuable growth elements, which are potentially effective when it comes to anti-aging, limiting neural degeneration, and more.**Umbilical cord tissue** , filled with Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), are the subject of clinical research looking at treatments for lung disease, Alzheimer\\'s, Autism, heart disease, hair loss, and more. In the case of personal injury or physical ailments, these can potentially be extremely helpful.To learn more in depth, check out our posts:\\u200dCord Blood Banking: Is It Worth It?⟨59⟩What is the placenta, and how does it work?⟨60⟩Cord Blood vs. Cord Tissue: What’s the Difference?⟨61⟩Curious how Mesenchymal Stem Cells can be used?⟨62⟩\\nHow much does Anja Health cost?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/622fe41167960612305a1556/64b44e028883c0cbf9ec8bca_chevron-blue.svg)\\nFor more information about the pricing check out our pricing page⟨5⟩\\n## Chat with our team\\nWe are quick.
