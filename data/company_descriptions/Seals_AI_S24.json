  "description": "Seals is a suite of AI Employees for Wholesalers & Distributors. Instead of relying on humans to quote, take orders, collect payments, place purchase orders and enter data into ERPs. We build AI Employees that do these manual repetitive tasks for the 700k wholesalers in the US.\r\n\nWe’re a team of three Computer Science majors, and Fernando launched and grew AT&T in Mexico to $120M ARR. Previously, we all worked together at our last YC-backed startup, building it to over $6M in revenue. It was there that we placed thousands of purchase orders with wholesalers.\r\n\nWe realized that almost every physical product comes from B2B sales in the supply chain. However, it turns out that most of these operations are still done manually through phone and email, involving tasks like quoting, taking orders, collecting payments, entering data into ERPs, and providing support. By automating these tasks with AI agents in a human-like manner, we are creating a massive opportunity to convert $100B of payroll expenses into software spending.",

  "generated_description": "**Seals AI**  \nFounded in 2024, Seals AI is on a mission to bring automation to wholesalers and distributors through a suite of AI employees. The core idea is to replace time-consuming manual tasks—like quoting, order taking, and data entry—with smart software that can manage all these operations efficiently. With around 700,000 wholesalers in the U.S. still relying heavily on outdated practices, this presents a monumental opportunity for cost savings and productivity boosts.\n\nThe team behind Seals AI consists of three Computer Science graduates with notable experience in the tech industry. Fernando, one of the co-founders, played a critical role in launching AT&T's operations in Mexico, driving it to a whopping $120 million ARR. They previously collaborated at a Y Combinator-backed startup, where they successfully navigated the intricacies of B2B sales and processed thousands of purchase orders.\n\nSeals AI aims to revolutionize the B2B supply chain landscape, where communication often happens via phone or email and numerous tasks remain manual. By integrating AI agents capable of interacting through various means—phone, email, SMS, and even WhatsApp—the company is positioned to help businesses turn approximately $100 billion of payroll expenses into software spending. This could redefine how wholesalers operate, making them more agile and profitable.\n\nLocated in San Francisco and currently part of the YCombinator S24 batch, Seals AI is a lean team of four, backed by industry experts. Their AI offerings include specialized roles like AI Sales, which handles orders and quotes; AI Retention, focused on customer engagement; and AI Support, ensuring customer issues are resolved swiftly. This holistic approach promises to drive sales and enhance customer relationships, all while providing real-time monitoring and management of business workflows.\n\nIn summary, Seals AI is not just another software company; it's a visionary player aiming to transform the wholesale and distribution sector through the power of AI.
