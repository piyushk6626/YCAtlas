Often this is the mom of one of the students. She recruits a class of up to 10 students, and we provide everything she needs to run a microschool - training, support, software, curriculum, and funding so she gets paid. In",

They seemed lost or bored - the conventional structure just wasn\\'t set up to cater to their individual needs. But kids should naturally love learning! So, I invited seven neighborhood kids around my kitchen table to try a different way\u2026\\n  * I set kids up working on projects, solving problems, collaborating with each other, nurturing their inherent curiosity.\\n  * I pulled from innovative, evidence-based research and focused on academics and emotional well-being.\\n  * I began to notice how other kids were thrilled when traditional school was canceled for a snow day, but devastated (to the point of tears!) when my microschool was canceled.\\n\\n\\nI wondered if there were other passionate people who might want to start their own microschools and help kids love learning again. Prenda has since grown into a full, K-8th grade learning experience. With a research-driven curriculum, real community and support, and plug-and-play software, you\\'ll have everything you need to start your own microschool and help kids discover their love of learning again.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335273f0595851975599_Signature.png)\\n**Kelly Smith** \u2013 Prenda Founder\\n[Learn More About Us](https://prenda.com/</who-we-are>)\\n![Prenda Guide with students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335273f0595851975592_Frame%201%20\\\\(1\\\\).webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335873f05958519759ce_hero-mobile%20\\\\(2\\\\).webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335273f0595851975592_Frame%201%20\\\\(1\\\\).webp)\\n## Kids (and Parents) love Prenda\\nI was looking for a different education option for my son. An environment that sparked his love of learning. Where he would feel comfortable, and like he belonged\u2026 I enrolled him in a Prenda Microschool. He was thrilled to be a part of this small-group setting where he could work at his own pace, collaborate with others, and get one-on-one support.In just a year, he went from two years behind in math to one year ahead. He was confident, and thriving, and that\u2019s all I ever wanted.\\nA Prenda Parent\\n![Prenda Student](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335573f0595851975738_Image%205.webp)\\nOur guide goes above and beyond for all her students. She has been working with my girls this whole school year and I\u2019ve seen such improvement in their academics and behavior, it really is amazing to see.

When he started public school for kindergarten, I began to see a change in him. He became quiet, and anxious, and didn\\'t seem to be learning much.

As I explored the idea of microschooling and researched Prenda, I found that it was the perfect fit for my family. Prenda has been a huge blessing for me as a guide, for my son, and for my other learners. Prenda\\'s teaching philosophy is top-notch. The program encourages autonomy which is one of the things that I value most in education. I am so grateful to God for placing me on this teaching journey with Prenda!

Prenda has allowed me the opportunity to bring my kids home and school them with great resources in a way that empowers them as learners. They learn to own their education, and they can work at their level regardless of where the other kids in their class are.\\nStephanie\\n\u2013 Prenda Guide\\n## FAQs\\nWhat is a microschool and what are the requirements to get started as a guide?\\nA microschool is a small group of learners led by a caring adult or \u201cguide\u201d that helps kids progress academically while deepening their love of learning and supporting a strong sense of self-efficacy.\\nThere are a few basic prerequisites to run a Prenda microschool:\\n  * a safe and suitable location\\n  * the internet\\n  * and you\u2013a caring, dependable, willing-to-learn adult! \\n\\n\\nDo I need to be a certified teacher to guide a microschool?\\nNo. There is no educational requirement to guide a microschool. Interestingly, about half of all guides are certified teachers and the other half are passionate parents or community members who want to make a difference for the students in their lives. We\u2019ve seen successful microschools run by homeschool parents, business leaders, soccer coaches, grandparents, and church leaders.\\n\u201cGuiding\u201d is different than \u201cteaching.\u201d Our learning experience does not depend on the guide to provide instruction as a teacher would in a classroom setting. Instead, you help students set goals, monitor their progress, and support them as they learn how to learn. Academic coaches provide expert support for guides and live 24-hour math tutoring is available for students when needed.\\nHow much does Prenda cost and how am I paid as a guide?\\nPrenda charges a per-student platform fee of $2,199 per year for state scholarship students or $219.90 per month for direct-pay students. \\nGuides charge an additional fee for microschool services provided to students. Each guide determines their own fee during the microschool setup process.\\nPrenda collects the total microschool fee from students, retains the Prenda platform fee, and transfers the guide fee portion to the guide through a third-party payment processor. The timing of billing and guide payments depends on how students in the microschool are funded.\\nCan I guide only my own children?\\nYes! We call this a \"Single-Family Microschool\" but we consider you just as much a guide as if you were guiding a \u201cMulti-Family Microschool.\u201d You still have access to all the tools and support a Multi-Family Microschool gets except payment services, unless you expand to serving students beyond your family.\\nWhat kind of time commitment is involved in guiding a microschool?\\nThe Prenda learning experience was designed around a 16-hour week for K-2nd grade students (4, 4-hour days) and a 20-hour week for 3-8th grade students (4, 5-hour days). However, you can choose to adjust this schedule to meet the needs of your community. You may also choose to guide more than one microschool. You\\'ll set your calendar for the year during the microschool setup process.\\nHow many students are in a microschool?\\nIn our experience, 7-10 learners in a microschool is ideal. You may choose to exceed 10 students, but we have found that when groups get too big the magic of the small group is lost and guiding becomes stressful. Most parents are looking for a small-group experience so if you accept more students, your microschool may become less attractive.\\nWhat is a State Scholarship?\\nA state scholarship provides public funding to families to use for their student\u2019s education. Families can use these state scholarship funds to pay for a student\u2019s Prenda microschool experience. The most common term for these scholarships is an \"Education Savings Account\" or \"ESA.\" Availability and details of these programs vary by state. If available in your state, this funding is typically enough to allow families to participate in a Prenda microschool with little to no out-of-pocket costs. \\nCheck out your state\\'s funding page by clicking your state on the map [here](https://prenda.com/</become-a-guide#funding>) for more information.\\nWhat does Direct Pay mean?\\nDirect Pay means that parents pay out of pocket for their child to utilize Prenda\\'s learning model and attend your microschool. Each student signs up for a monthly subscription that includes the $219.90 Prenda fee plus whatever you (the guide) decide to charge as a monthly guide fee. You\\'ll set your guide fee during the microschool setup process.\\nWhat is the guide\u2019s relationship with Prenda? \\nEach guide is an independent business owner, who is solely responsible for operating their own microschool. You are not a Prenda employee or independent contractor. Prenda is an educational service provider that helps provide you with the resources and support you need to run a successful microschool.\\nDoes Prenda find students for my microschool?\\nPrenda does not assign students to microschools. It is up to you as the guide to recruit students and families for your microschool. We provide helpful resources like Facebook pages where guides and families can connect, the microschool map, and a customizable microschool profile page to help you spread the word about your school. Additionally, we provide you with information and shareable resources to help your community understand what a microschool is and why they might be interested in attending with you.\\nYou can learn more about how to recruit students to your microschool on our free webinar \"marketing your microschool\" [here.](https://prenda.com/<https:/learn.prenda.com/buildingbuzz>)\\nAre locations provided for microschools?\\nPrenda does not provide locations for microschools. It is up to you as the guide to find and secure a suitable location for your microschool. Most guides operate out of their home, but many use more formal locations like churches, commercial spaces, or community centers. Some guides share a larger location and host several microschools together. If finding a location sounds hard, reach out to us and we can help you think through your options and connect you with a guide coach that can support you.\\nDoes Prenda ensure the security and safety of students in my microschool?\\nNo. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of students rests with the guide and the families who choose to enroll in the microschool. Prenda does not approve or certify microschool locations and does not guarantee the safety and security of students in the microschool. It is important for parents to conduct due diligence and make sure the guide and microschool environment is a good fit for their child.\\nPrenda requires a background check for every guide and adult who will be at the location during school hours. Prenda pays for all background checks. Guides should ensure that students are always safe while at their microschool. This includes controlling access to things like drugs, medicine, chemicals, alcohol, or weapons, and any bodies of water as well as ensuring that students are safe on the internet. \\nWhat is a microschool and what are the requirements to get started as a guide?\\nA microschool is a small group of learners led by a caring adult or \u201cguide\u201d that helps kids progress academically while deepening their love of learning and supporting a strong sense of self-efficacy.\\nThere are a few basic prerequisites to run a Prenda microschool:\\n  * a safe and suitable location\\n  * the internet\\n  * and you\u2013a caring, dependable, willing-to-learn adult! \\n\\n\\nDo I need to be a certified teacher to guide a microschool?\\nNo. There is no educational requirement to guide a microschool.

They seemed lost or bored - the conventional structure just wasn\\'t set up to cater to their individual needs. But kids should naturally love learning! So, I invited seven neighborhood kids around my kitchen table to try a different way\u2026\\n  * I set kids up working on projects, solving problems, collaborating with each other, nurturing their inherent curiosity.\\n  * I pulled from innovative, evidence-based research and focused on academics and emotional well-being.\\n  * I began to notice how other kids were thrilled when traditional school was canceled for a snow day, but devastated (to the point of tears!) when my microschool was canceled.\\n\\n\\nI wondered if there were other passionate people who might want to start their own microschools and help kids love learning again. Prenda has since grown into a full, K-8th grade learning experience. With a research-driven curriculum, real community and support, and plug-and-play software, you\\'ll have everything you need to start your own microschool and help kids discover their love of learning again.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335273f0595851975599_Signature.png)\\n**Kelly Smith** \u2013 Prenda Founder\\nLearn More About Us\u27e84\u27e9\\n![Prenda Guide with students\u27e836\u27e9].webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students\u27e837\u27e9].webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students\u27e836\u27e9].webp)\\n## Kids (and Parents) love Prenda\\nI was looking for a different education option for my son.

The program encourages autonomy which is one of the things that I value most in education. I am so grateful to God for placing me on this teaching journey with Prenda!

Education is fun again and parents are witnessing their whole child grow. I can\u2019t tell you how honored I am to provide an educational environment like this to these kids and foster a love of lifelong learning in each of them.\\nJamie\\n\u2013 Prenda Guide\\n![Prenda Guide with students\u27e854\u27e9]\\n![Prenda Guide with students\u27e855\u27e9]\\nI was unsure about leaving my job and pulling my kids from public school.

We made the jump, and I started a microschool with my own two children and four additional learners. My students love coming to school every day so much that going home is the most challenging transition. Thank you to Prenda for offering this life-changing experience.\\nHeather\\n\u2013 Prenda Guide\\n![Prenda Guide with students\u27e856\u27e9]\\n![Prenda Guide with students\u27e857\u27e9]\\nAs a previous homeschool parent, I know the stress of choosing curriculum and making sure you have all your bases covered to teach your children independently. Prenda has allowed me the opportunity to bring my kids home and school them with great resources in a way that empowers them as learners. They learn to own their education, and they can work at their level regardless of where the other kids in their class are.\\nStephanie\\n\u2013 Prenda Guide\\n## FAQs\\nWhat is a microschool and what are the requirements to get started as a guide?\\nA microschool is a small group of learners led by a caring adult or \u201cguide\u201d that helps kids progress academically while deepening their love of learning and supporting a strong sense of self-efficacy.\\nThere are a few basic prerequisites to run a Prenda microschool:\\n  * a safe and suitable location\\n  * the internet\\n  * and you\u2013a caring, dependable, willing-to-learn adult! \\n\\n\\nDo I need to be a certified teacher to guide a microschool?\\nNo. There is no educational requirement to guide a microschool. Interestingly, about half of all guides are certified teachers and the other half are passionate parents or community members who want to make a difference for the students in their lives. We\u2019ve seen successful microschools run by homeschool parents, business leaders, soccer coaches, grandparents, and church leaders.\\n\u201cGuiding\u201d is different than \u201cteaching.\u201d Our learning experience does not depend on the guide to provide instruction as a teacher would in a classroom setting. Instead, you help students set goals, monitor their progress, and support them as they learn how to learn. Academic coaches provide expert support for guides and live 24-hour math tutoring is available for students when needed.\\nHow much does Prenda cost and how am I paid as a guide?\\nPrenda charges a per-student platform fee of $2,199 per year for state scholarship students or $219.90 per month for direct-pay students. \\nGuides charge an additional fee for microschool services provided to students. Each guide determines their own fee during the microschool setup process.\\nPrenda collects the total microschool fee from students, retains the Prenda platform fee, and transfers the guide fee portion to the guide through a third-party payment processor. The timing of billing and guide payments depends on how students in the microschool are funded.\\nCan I guide only my own children?\\nYes! We call this a \"Single-Family Microschool\" but we consider you just as much a guide as if you were guiding a \u201cMulti-Family Microschool.\u201d You still have access to all the tools and support a Multi-Family Microschool gets except payment services, unless you expand to serving students beyond your family.\\nWhat kind of time commitment is involved in guiding a microschool?\\nThe Prenda learning experience was designed around a 16-hour week for K-2nd grade students (4, 4-hour days) and a 20-hour week for 3-8th grade students (4, 5-hour days). However, you can choose to adjust this schedule to meet the needs of your community. You may also choose to guide more than one microschool. You\\'ll set your calendar for the year during the microschool setup process.\\nHow many students are in a microschool?\\nIn our experience, 7-10 learners in a microschool is ideal. You may choose to exceed 10 students, but we have found that when groups get too big the magic of the small group is lost and guiding becomes stressful. Most parents are looking for a small-group experience so if you accept more students, your microschool may become less attractive.\\nWhat is a State Scholarship?\\nA state scholarship provides public funding to families to use for their student\u2019s education. Families can use these state scholarship funds to pay for a student\u2019s Prenda microschool experience. The most common term for these scholarships is an \"Education Savings Account\" or \"ESA.\" Availability and details of these programs vary by state. If available in your state, this funding is typically enough to allow families to participate in a Prenda microschool with little to no out-of-pocket costs. \\nCheck out your state\\'s funding page by clicking your state on the map here\u27e858\u27e9 for more information.\\nWhat does Direct Pay mean?\\nDirect Pay means that parents pay out of pocket for their child to utilize Prenda\\'s learning model and attend your microschool. Each student signs up for a monthly subscription that includes the $219.90 Prenda fee plus whatever you (the guide) decide to charge as a monthly guide fee.

It is up to you as the guide to recruit students and families for your microschool. We provide helpful resources like Facebook pages where guides and families can connect, the microschool map, and a customizable microschool profile page to help you spread the word about your school. Additionally, we provide you with information and shareable resources to help your community understand what a microschool is and why they might be interested in attending with you.\\nYou can learn more about how to recruit students to your microschool on our free webinar \"marketing your microschool\" here.\u27e859\u27e9\\nAre locations provided for microschools?\\nPrenda does not provide locations for microschools. It is up to you as the guide to find and secure a suitable location for your microschool. Most guides operate out of their home, but many use more formal locations like churches, commercial spaces, or community centers. Some guides share a larger location and host several microschools together. If finding a location sounds hard, reach out to us and we can help you think through your options and connect you with a guide coach that can support you.\\nDoes Prenda ensure the security and safety of students in my microschool?\\nNo. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of students rests with the guide and the families who choose to enroll in the microschool. Prenda does not approve or certify microschool locations and does not guarantee the safety and security of students in the microschool. It is important for parents to conduct due diligence and make sure the guide and microschool environment is a good fit for their child.\\nPrenda requires a background check for every guide and adult who will be at the location during school hours. Prenda pays for all background checks. Guides should ensure that students are always safe while at their microschool. This includes controlling access to things like drugs, medicine, chemicals, alcohol, or weapons, and any bodies of water as well as ensuring that students are safe on the internet. \\nWhat is a microschool and what are the requirements to get started as a guide?\\nA microschool is a small group of learners led by a caring adult or \u201cguide\u201d that helps kids progress academically while deepening their love of learning and supporting a strong sense of self-efficacy.\\nThere are a few basic prerequisites to run a Prenda microschool:\\n  * a safe and suitable location\\n  * the internet\\n  * and you\u2013a caring, dependable, willing-to-learn adult! \\n\\n\\nDo I need to be a certified teacher to guide a microschool?\\nNo. There is no educational requirement to guide a microschool. Interestingly, about half of all guides are certified teachers and the other half are passionate parents or community members who want to make a difference for the students in their lives. We\u2019ve seen successful microschools run by homeschool parents, business leaders, soccer coaches, grandparents, and church leaders.\\n\u201cGuiding\u201d is different than \u201cteaching.\u201d Our learning experience does not depend on the guide to provide instruction as a teacher would in a classroom setting. Instead, you help students set goals, monitor their progress, and support them as they learn how to learn. Academic coaches provide expert support for guides and live 24-hour math tutoring is available for students when needed.\\nHow much does Prenda cost and how am I paid as a guide?\\nPrenda charges a per-student platform fee of $2,199 per year for state scholarship students or $219.90 per month for direct-pay students. \\nGuides charge an additional fee for microschool services provided to students. Each guide determines their own fee during the microschool setup process.\\nPrenda collects the total microschool fee from students, retains the Prenda platform fee, and transfers the guide fee portion to the guide through a third-party payment processor. The timing of billing and guide payments depends on how students in the microschool are funded.\\nLearn more about how much you can earn as a guide here.\u27e860\u27e9\\nCan I guide only my own children?\\nYes! We call this a \"Single-Family Microschool\" but we consider you just as much a guide as if you were guiding a \u201cMulti-Family Microschool.\u201d You still have access to all the tools and support a Multi-Family Microschool gets except payment services, unless you expand to serving students beyond your family.\\nWhat kind of time commitment is involved in guiding a microschool?\\nThe Prenda learning experience was designed around a 16-hour week for K-2nd grade students (4, 4-hour days) and a 20-hour week for 3-8th grade students (4, 5-hour days). However, you can choose to adjust this schedule to meet the needs of your community. You may also choose to guide more than one microschool. You\\'ll set your calendar for the year during the microschool setup process.\\nHow many students are in a microschool?\\nIn our experience, 7-10 learners in a microschool is ideal. You may choose to exceed 10 students, but we have found that when groups get too big the magic of the small group is lost and guiding becomes stressful. Most parents are looking for a small-group experience so if you accept more students, your microschool may become less attractive.\\nWhat is a State Scholarship?\\nA state scholarship provides public funding to families to use for their student\u2019s education. Families can use these state scholarship funds to pay for a student\u2019s Prenda microschool experience. The most common term for these scholarships is an \"Education Savings Account\" or \"ESA.\" Availability and details of these programs vary by state. If available in your state, this funding is typically enough to allow families to participate in a Prenda microschool with little to no out-of-pocket costs. \\nCheck out your state\\'s funding page by clicking your state on the map here\u27e860\u27e9 for more information.\\n**What does Direct Pay mean?**\\nDirect Pay means that parents pay out of pocket for their child to utilize Prenda\\'s learning model and attend your microschool.

    "generated_description": "### Prenda: Redefining K-8 Education with Microschools\n\n**Overview**  \nFounded in 2017 and an alum of Y Combinator's Batch S19, Prenda is blazing a new trail in education through its innovative microschool model. Based in Mesa, Arizona, with a growing team of 150, Prenda aims to rekindle the love of learning in children by offering personalized, community-based education.\n\n**Mission**  \nAt its core, Prenda's mission is to facilitate the establishment of K-8 microschools within local neighborhoods.
