They seemed lost or bored - the conventional structure just wasn\\'t set up to cater to their individual needs. But kids should naturally love learning! So, I invited seven neighborhood kids around my kitchen table to try a different way…\\n  * I set kids up working on projects, solving problems, collaborating with each other, nurturing their inherent curiosity.\\n  * I pulled from innovative, evidence-based research and focused on academics and emotional well-being.\\n  * I began to notice how other kids were thrilled when traditional school was canceled for a snow day, but devastated (to the point of tears!) when my microschool was canceled.\\n\\n\\nI wondered if there were other passionate people who might want to start their own microschools and help kids love learning again. Prenda has since grown into a full, K-8th grade learning experience. With a research-driven curriculum, real community and support, and plug-and-play software, you\\'ll have everything you need to start your own microschool and help kids discover their love of learning again.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335273f0595851975599_Signature.png)\\n**Kelly Smith** – Prenda Founder\\n[Learn More About Us](https://prenda.com/</who-we-are>)\\n![Prenda Guide with students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335273f0595851975592_Frame%201%20\\\\(1\\\\).webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335873f05958519759ce_hero-mobile%20\\\\(2\\\\).webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335273f0595851975592_Frame%201%20\\\\(1\\\\).webp)\\n## Kids (and Parents) love Prenda\\nI was looking for a different education option for my son. An environment that sparked his love of learning. Where he would feel comfortable, and like he belonged… I enrolled him in a Prenda Microschool. He was thrilled to be a part of this small-group setting where he could work at his own pace, collaborate with others, and get one-on-one support.In just a year, he went from two years behind in math to one year ahead. He was confident, and thriving, and that’s all I ever wanted.\\nA Prenda Parent\\n![Prenda Student](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335573f0595851975738_Image%205.webp)\\nOur guide goes above and beyond for all her students. She has been working with my girls this whole school year and I’ve seen such improvement in their academics and behavior, it really is amazing to see. I’m a single mom of 3 girls and I thought that traditional education was my only option, thanks to Prenda and our guide, my girls are getting the education they need and deserve.\\nA Prenda Parent\\n![Prenda Students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335b73f0595851975ca2_Image%202.webp)\\nMy little guy has always been bold, kind, outspoken, brave, and funny. When he started public school for kindergarten, I began to see a change in him. He became quiet, and anxious, and didn\\'t seem to be learning much. He started Prenda for second grade, and I am beyond impressed. My son got his spark back! He cares about how he learns best! He is not just surviving school, he is thriving, and I couldn\\'t be happier! He is back to his old self, and honestly, he is even better. I got my kid back, thanks to Prenda.\\nA Prenda Parent\\n![Prenda Students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335573f0595851975748_Image%203.webp)\\nOur Prenda guide has changed the lives of my daughter and my family. Our daughter has ADHD and was really struggling in public school. This frustration led to poor behaviors. She has been with her Prenda guide the past two years and she is thriving. She went from a kid who absolutely hated school to one that LOVES it. Her whole attitude changed and we got our sweet and thoughtful girl back. All of the stress and anxiety that our family had is gone.\\nA Prenda Parent\\n![Prenda Student](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335b73f0595851975c85_Image%204.webp)\\nMy child joined Prenda in the middle of third grade and we had struggled with her learning. I had my suspicions that she was behind but the school kept pushing her forward. When she joined Prenda my suspicions were confirmed - she was two years behind in Math and Reading.

An environment that sparked his love of learning. Where he would feel comfortable, and like he belonged… I enrolled him in a Prenda Microschool. He was thrilled to be a part of this small-group setting where he could work at his own pace, collaborate with others, and get one-on-one support.In just a year, he went from two years behind in math to one year ahead. He was confident, and thriving, and that’s all I ever wanted.\\nA Prenda Parent\\n![Prenda Student](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335573f0595851975738_Image%205.webp)\\n![Prenda Student](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335573f0595851975738_Image%205.webp)\\nOur guide goes above and beyond for all her students. She has been working with my girls this whole school year and I’ve seen such improvement in their academics and behavior, it really is amazing to see.

When he started public school for kindergarten, I began to see a change in him. He became quiet, and anxious, and didn\\'t seem to be learning much. He started Prenda for second grade, and I am beyond impressed. My son got his spark back! He cares about how he learns best!

As I explored the idea of microschooling and researched Prenda, I found that it was the perfect fit for my family. Prenda has been a huge blessing for me as a guide, for my son, and for my other learners. Prenda\\'s teaching philosophy is top-notch. The program encourages autonomy which is one of the things that I value most in education. I am so grateful to God for placing me on this teaching journey with Prenda! It has been amazing!\\n**Ranita**\\n– Prenda Guide\\n![Prenda Guide with students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335673f059585197582e_IMG%20\\\\(12\\\\).webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335a73f0595851975b48_image-1.webp)\\nI love Prenda! This is an educator\\'s dream job! I have never (in my nearly 30 years of being an educator) been so excited to see graphs, data charts, and diagnostic reports! I\\'m genuinely giddy!

But I can just say that Prenda is a miracle for my students and me.I have no burnout. I have minimal stress. I wake up, make the commute down my hallway, and get my home space ready to teach.

Prenda has allowed me the opportunity to bring my kids home and school them with great resources in a way that empowers them as learners. They learn to own their education, and they can work at their level regardless of where the other kids in their class are.\\nStephanie\\n– Prenda Guide\\n## FAQs\\nWhat is a microschool and what are the requirements to get started as a guide?\\nA microschool is a small group of learners led by a caring adult or “guide” that helps kids progress academically while deepening their love of learning and supporting a strong sense of self-efficacy.\\nThere are a few basic prerequisites to run a Prenda microschool:\\n  * a safe and suitable location\\n  * the internet\\n  * and you–a caring, dependable, willing-to-learn adult! \\n\\n\\nDo I need to be a certified teacher to guide a microschool?\\nNo. There is no educational requirement to guide a microschool. Interestingly, about half of all guides are certified teachers and the other half are passionate parents or community members who want to make a difference for the students in their lives. We’ve seen successful microschools run by homeschool parents, business leaders, soccer coaches, grandparents, and church leaders.\\n“Guiding” is different than “teaching.” Our learning experience does not depend on the guide to provide instruction as a teacher would in a classroom setting. Instead, you help students set goals, monitor their progress, and support them as they learn how to learn. Academic coaches provide expert support for guides and live 24-hour math tutoring is available for students when needed.\\nHow much does Prenda cost and how am I paid as a guide?\\nPrenda charges a per-student platform fee of $2,199 per year for state scholarship students or $219.90 per month for direct-pay students. \\nGuides charge an additional fee for microschool services provided to students. Each guide determines their own fee during the microschool setup process.\\nPrenda collects the total microschool fee from students, retains the Prenda platform fee, and transfers the guide fee portion to the guide through a third-party payment processor. The timing of billing and guide payments depends on how students in the microschool are funded.\\nCan I guide only my own children?\\nYes! We call this a \"Single-Family Microschool\" but we consider you just as much a guide as if you were guiding a “Multi-Family Microschool.” You still have access to all the tools and support a Multi-Family Microschool gets except payment services, unless you expand to serving students beyond your family.\\nWhat kind of time commitment is involved in guiding a microschool?\\nThe Prenda learning experience was designed around a 16-hour week for K-2nd grade students (4, 4-hour days) and a 20-hour week for 3-8th grade students (4, 5-hour days). However, you can choose to adjust this schedule to meet the needs of your community. You may also choose to guide more than one microschool. You\\'ll set your calendar for the year during the microschool setup process.\\nHow many students are in a microschool?\\nIn our experience, 7-10 learners in a microschool is ideal. You may choose to exceed 10 students, but we have found that when groups get too big the magic of the small group is lost and guiding becomes stressful. Most parents are looking for a small-group experience so if you accept more students, your microschool may become less attractive.\\nWhat is a State Scholarship?\\nA state scholarship provides public funding to families to use for their student’s education. Families can use these state scholarship funds to pay for a student’s Prenda microschool experience. The most common term for these scholarships is an \"Education Savings Account\" or \"ESA.\" Availability and details of these programs vary by state. If available in your state, this funding is typically enough to allow families to participate in a Prenda microschool with little to no out-of-pocket costs. \\nCheck out your state\\'s funding page by clicking your state on the map [here](https://prenda.com/</become-a-guide#funding>) for more information.\\nWhat does Direct Pay mean?\\nDirect Pay means that parents pay out of pocket for their child to utilize Prenda\\'s learning model and attend your microschool. Each student signs up for a monthly subscription that includes the $219.90 Prenda fee plus whatever you (the guide) decide to charge as a monthly guide fee. You\\'ll set your guide fee during the microschool setup process.\\nWhat is the guide’s relationship with Prenda? \\nEach guide is an independent business owner, who is solely responsible for operating their own microschool. You are not a Prenda employee or independent contractor. Prenda is an educational service provider that helps provide you with the resources and support you need to run a successful microschool.\\nDoes Prenda find students for my microschool?\\nPrenda does not assign students to microschools. It is up to you as the guide to recruit students and families for your microschool. We provide helpful resources like Facebook pages where guides and families can connect, the microschool map, and a customizable microschool profile page to help you spread the word about your school. Additionally, we provide you with information and shareable resources to help your community understand what a microschool is and why they might be interested in attending with you.\\nYou can learn more about how to recruit students to your microschool on our free webinar \"marketing your microschool\" [here.](https://prenda.com/<https:/learn.prenda.com/buildingbuzz>)\\nAre locations provided for microschools?\\nPrenda does not provide locations for microschools. It is up to you as the guide to find and secure a suitable location for your microschool. Most guides operate out of their home, but many use more formal locations like churches, commercial spaces, or community centers. Some guides share a larger location and host several microschools together. If finding a location sounds hard, reach out to us and we can help you think through your options and connect you with a guide coach that can support you.\\nDoes Prenda ensure the security and safety of students in my microschool?\\nNo. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of students rests with the guide and the families who choose to enroll in the microschool. Prenda does not approve or certify microschool locations and does not guarantee the safety and security of students in the microschool. It is important for parents to conduct due diligence and make sure the guide and microschool environment is a good fit for their child.\\nPrenda requires a background check for every guide and adult who will be at the location during school hours. Prenda pays for all background checks. Guides should ensure that students are always safe while at their microschool. This includes controlling access to things like drugs, medicine, chemicals, alcohol, or weapons, and any bodies of water as well as ensuring that students are safe on the internet. \\nWhat is a microschool and what are the requirements to get started as a guide?\\nA microschool is a small group of learners led by a caring adult or “guide” that helps kids progress academically while deepening their love of learning and supporting a strong sense of self-efficacy.\\nThere are a few basic prerequisites to run a Prenda microschool:\\n  * a safe and suitable location\\n  * the internet\\n  * and you–a caring, dependable, willing-to-learn adult! \\n\\n\\nDo I need to be a certified teacher to guide a microschool?\\nNo. There is no educational requirement to guide a microschool.

They seemed lost or bored - the conventional structure just wasn\\'t set up to cater to their individual needs. But kids should naturally love learning! So, I invited seven neighborhood kids around my kitchen table to try a different way…\\n  * I set kids up working on projects, solving problems, collaborating with each other, nurturing their inherent curiosity.\\n  * I pulled from innovative, evidence-based research and focused on academics and emotional well-being.\\n  * I began to notice how other kids were thrilled when traditional school was canceled for a snow day, but devastated (to the point of tears!) when my microschool was canceled.\\n\\n\\nI wondered if there were other passionate people who might want to start their own microschools and help kids love learning again. Prenda has since grown into a full, K-8th grade learning experience. With a research-driven curriculum, real community and support, and plug-and-play software, you\\'ll have everything you need to start your own microschool and help kids discover their love of learning again.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61783ff414c9d8285b7d8e7a/664d335273f0595851975599_Signature.png)\\n**Kelly Smith** – Prenda Founder\\nLearn More About Us⟨4⟩\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨36⟩].webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨37⟩].webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨36⟩].webp)\\n## Kids (and Parents) love Prenda\\nI was looking for a different education option for my son. An environment that sparked his love of learning. Where he would feel comfortable, and like he belonged… I enrolled him in a Prenda Microschool. He was thrilled to be a part of this small-group setting where he could work at his own pace, collaborate with others, and get one-on-one support.In just a year, he went from two years behind in math to one year ahead. He was confident, and thriving, and that’s all I ever wanted.\\nA Prenda Parent\\n![Prenda Student⟨38⟩]\\nOur guide goes above and beyond for all her students.

As I explored the idea of microschooling and researched Prenda, I found that it was the perfect fit for my family. Prenda has been a huge blessing for me as a guide, for my son, and for my other learners. Prenda\\'s teaching philosophy is top-notch. The program encourages autonomy which is one of the things that I value most in education. I am so grateful to God for placing me on this teaching journey with Prenda! It has been amazing!\\n**Ranita**\\n– Prenda Guide\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨50⟩].webp)\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨51⟩]\\nI love Prenda! This is an educator\\'s dream job! I have never (in my nearly 30 years of being an educator) been so excited to see graphs, data charts, and diagnostic reports! I\\'m genuinely giddy! The collaborative efforts that happen when they have ownership of their learning, and their eagerness to work on the next subject--it makes my heart flutter! This educator mama\\'s heart is bursting!\\nTrina\\n– Prenda Guide\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨52⟩]\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨53⟩]\\nI can’t describe to you precisely the magic that happens here. But I can just say that Prenda is a miracle for my students and me.I have no burnout. I have minimal stress. I wake up, make the commute down my hallway, and get my home space ready to teach. Education is fun again and parents are witnessing their whole child grow. I can’t tell you how honored I am to provide an educational environment like this to these kids and foster a love of lifelong learning in each of them.\\nJamie\\n– Prenda Guide\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨54⟩]\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨55⟩]\\nI was unsure about leaving my job and pulling my kids from public school. I was nervous that I didn\\'t have what it took to teach, and leaving the only system I knew seemed scary and crazy. We made the jump, and I started a microschool with my own two children and four additional learners. My students love coming to school every day so much that going home is the most challenging transition. Thank you to Prenda for offering this life-changing experience.\\nHeather\\n– Prenda Guide\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨56⟩]\\n![Prenda Guide with students⟨57⟩]\\nAs a previous homeschool parent, I know the stress of choosing curriculum and making sure you have all your bases covered to teach your children independently. Prenda has allowed me the opportunity to bring my kids home and school them with great resources in a way that empowers them as learners. They learn to own their education, and they can work at their level regardless of where the other kids in their class are.\\nStephanie\\n– Prenda Guide\\n## FAQs\\nWhat is a microschool and what are the requirements to get started as a guide?\\nA microschool is a small group of learners led by a caring adult or “guide” that helps kids progress academically while deepening their love of learning and supporting a strong sense of self-efficacy.\\nThere are a few basic prerequisites to run a Prenda microschool:\\n  * a safe and suitable location\\n  * the internet\\n  * and you–a caring, dependable, willing-to-learn adult! \\n\\n\\nDo I need to be a certified teacher to guide a microschool?\\nNo. There is no educational requirement to guide a microschool. Interestingly, about half of all guides are certified teachers and the other half are passionate parents or community members who want to make a difference for the students in their lives. We’ve seen successful microschools run by homeschool parents, business leaders, soccer coaches, grandparents, and church leaders.\\n“Guiding” is different than “teaching.” Our learning experience does not depend on the guide to provide instruction as a teacher would in a classroom setting. Instead, you help students set goals, monitor their progress, and support them as they learn how to learn. Academic coaches provide expert support for guides and live 24-hour math tutoring is available for students when needed.\\nHow much does Prenda cost and how am I paid as a guide?\\nPrenda charges a per-student platform fee of $2,199 per year for state scholarship students or $219.90 per month for direct-pay students. \\nGuides charge an additional fee for microschool services provided to students. Each guide determines their own fee during the microschool setup process.\\nPrenda collects the total microschool fee from students, retains the Prenda platform fee, and transfers the guide fee portion to the guide through a third-party payment processor. The timing of billing and guide payments depends on how students in the microschool are funded.\\nCan I guide only my own children?\\nYes! We call this a \"Single-Family Microschool\" but we consider you just as much a guide as if you were guiding a “Multi-Family Microschool.” You still have access to all the tools and support a Multi-Family Microschool gets except payment services, unless you expand to serving students beyond your family.\\nWhat kind of time commitment is involved in guiding a microschool?\\nThe Prenda learning experience was designed around a 16-hour week for K-2nd grade students (4, 4-hour days) and a 20-hour week for 3-8th grade students (4, 5-hour days). However, you can choose to adjust this schedule to meet the needs of your community. You may also choose to guide more than one microschool. You\\'ll set your calendar for the year during the microschool setup process.\\nHow many students are in a microschool?\\nIn our experience, 7-10 learners in a microschool is ideal. You may choose to exceed 10 students, but we have found that when groups get too big the magic of the small group is lost and guiding becomes stressful. Most parents are looking for a small-group experience so if you accept more students, your microschool may become less attractive.\\nWhat is a State Scholarship?\\nA state scholarship provides public funding to families to use for their student’s education. Families can use these state scholarship funds to pay for a student’s Prenda microschool experience. The most common term for these scholarships is an \"Education Savings Account\" or \"ESA.\" Availability and details of these programs vary by state. If available in your state, this funding is typically enough to allow families to participate in a Prenda microschool with little to no out-of-pocket costs. \\nCheck out your state\\'s funding page by clicking your state on the map here⟨58⟩ for more information.\\nWhat does Direct Pay mean?\\nDirect Pay means that parents pay out of pocket for their child to utilize Prenda\\'s learning model and attend your microschool. Each student signs up for a monthly subscription that includes the $219.90 Prenda fee plus whatever you (the guide) decide to charge as a monthly guide fee. You\\'ll set your guide fee during the microschool setup process.\\nWhat is the guide’s relationship with Prenda? \\nEach guide is an independent business owner, who is solely responsible for operating their own microschool. You are not a Prenda employee or independent contractor. Prenda is an educational service provider that helps provide you with the resources and support you need to run a successful microschool.\\nDoes Prenda find students for my microschool?\\nPrenda does not assign students to microschools. It is up to you as the guide to recruit students and families for your microschool. We provide helpful resources like Facebook pages where guides and families can connect, the microschool map, and a customizable microschool profile page to help you spread the word about your school. Additionally, we provide you with information and shareable resources to help your community understand what a microschool is and why they might be interested in attending with you.\\nYou can learn more about how to recruit students to your microschool on our free webinar \"marketing your microschool\" here.⟨59⟩\\nAre locations provided for microschools?\\nPrenda does not provide locations for microschools. It is up to you as the guide to find and secure a suitable location for your microschool. Most guides operate out of their home, but many use more formal locations like churches, commercial spaces, or community centers. Some guides share a larger location and host several microschools together. If finding a location sounds hard, reach out to us and we can help you think through your options and connect you with a guide coach that can support you.\\nDoes Prenda ensure the security and safety of students in my microschool?\\nNo. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of students rests with the guide and the families who choose to enroll in the microschool. Prenda does not approve or certify microschool locations and does not guarantee the safety and security of students in the microschool. It is important for parents to conduct due diligence and make sure the guide and microschool environment is a good fit for their child.\\nPrenda requires a background check for every guide and adult who will be at the location during school hours. Prenda pays for all background checks. Guides should ensure that students are always safe while at their microschool. This includes controlling access to things like drugs, medicine, chemicals, alcohol, or weapons, and any bodies of water as well as ensuring that students are safe on the internet. \\nWhat is a microschool and what are the requirements to get started as a guide?\\nA microschool is a small group of learners led by a caring adult or “guide” that helps kids progress academically while deepening their love of learning and supporting a strong sense of self-efficacy.\\nThere are a few basic prerequisites to run a Prenda microschool:\\n  * a safe and suitable location\\n  * the internet\\n  * and you–a caring, dependable, willing-to-learn adult! \\n\\n\\nDo I need to be a certified teacher to guide a microschool?\\nNo. There is no educational requirement to guide a microschool.

You\\'ll set your calendar for the year during the microschool setup process.\\nHow many students are in a microschool?\\nIn our experience, 7-10 learners in a microschool is ideal. You may choose to exceed 10 students, but we have found that when groups get too big the magic of the small group is lost and guiding becomes stressful. Most parents are looking for a small-group experience so if you accept more students, your microschool may become less attractive.\\nWhat is a State Scholarship?\\nA state scholarship provides public funding to families to use for their student’s education. Families can use these state scholarship funds to pay for a student’s Prenda microschool experience. The most common term for these scholarships is an \"Education Savings Account\" or \"ESA.\" Availability and details of these programs vary by state. If available in your state, this funding is typically enough to allow families to participate in a Prenda microschool with little to no out-of-pocket costs. \\nCheck out your state\\'s funding page by clicking your state on the map here⟨60⟩ for more information.\\n**What does Direct Pay mean?**\\nDirect Pay means that parents pay out of pocket for their child to utilize Prenda\\'s learning model and attend your microschool. Each student signs up for a monthly subscription that includes the $219.90 Prenda fee plus whatever you (the guide) decide to charge as a monthly guide fee. You\\'ll set your guide fee during the microschool setup process.\\nWhat is the guide’s relationship with Prenda? \\nEach guide is an independent business owner, who is solely responsible for operating their own microschool. You are not a Prenda employee or independent contractor. Prenda is an educational service provider that helps provide you with the resources and support you need to run a successful microschool.\\nDoes Prenda find students for my microschool?\\nPrenda does not assign students to microschools. It is up to you as the guide to recruit students and families for your microschool. We provide helpful resources like Facebook pages where guides and families can connect, the microschool map, and a customizable microschool profile page to help you spread the word about your school. Additionally, we provide you with information and shareable resources to help your community understand what a microschool is and why they might be interested in attending with you.\\nYou can learn more about how to recruit students to your microschool on our free webinar \"marketing your microschool\" here\\nAre locations provided for microschools?\\nPrenda does not provide locations for microschools. It is up to you as the guide to find and secure a suitable location for your microschool. Most guides operate out of their home, but many use more formal locations like churches, commercial spaces, or community centers. Some guides share a larger location and host several microschools together. If finding a location sounds hard, reach out to us and we can help you think through your options and connect you with a guide coach that can support you.\\nDoes Prenda ensure the security and safety of students in my microschool?\\nNo. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of students rests with the guide and the families who choose to enroll in the microschool. Prenda does not approve or certify microschool locations and does not guarantee the safety and security of students in the microschool. It is important for parents to conduct due diligence and make sure the guide and microschool environment is a good fit for their child.\\nPrenda requires a background check for every guide and adult who will be at the location during school hours. Prenda pays for all background checks. Guides should ensure that students are always safe while at their microschool. This includes controlling access to things like drugs, medicine, chemicals, alcohol, or weapons, and any bodies of water as well as ensuring that students are safe on the internet. \\nStart My

  "generated_description": "### Prenda: Redefining K-8 Education with Microschools\n\n**Overview**  \nFounded in 2017 and an alum of Y Combinator's Batch S19, Prenda is blazing a new trail in education through its innovative microschool model. Based in Mesa, Arizona, with a growing team of 150, Prenda aims to rekindle the love of learning in children by offering personalized, community-based education.\n\n**Mission**  \nAt its core, Prenda's mission is to facilitate the establishment of K-8 microschools within local neighborhoods. The premise is straightforward yet powerful: empower passionate adults—often parents or community members—to create small, tailored educational environments for up to 10 students.\n\n**How It Works**  \nPrenda provides everything necessary for running a microschool. Here’s what you get:\n\n- **Guidance and Training**: New guides receive comprehensive training and ongoing support, ensuring they’re equipped to nurture learners.\n- **Curriculum and Software**: Prenda supplies a flexible curriculum that adapts to students' individual needs alongside intuitive software for school management.\n- **Funding**: The model incorporates funding mechanisms so guides can earn a living while contributing to their communities.\n\n**Who Can Be a Guide?**  \nYou don’t have to be a certified teacher. Many guides come from diverse backgrounds—a blend of educators, parents, and community leaders—all motivated to make a difference. \n\n**The Prenda Experience**  \nA typical day in a Prenda microschool revolves around four key modes of learning:\n1. **Connect**: Building values and personal development.\n2. **Conquer**: Mastery-focused personalized academics.\n3. **Collaborate**: Inquiry-led group activities.\n4. **Create**: Hands-on project-based learning.\n\nThese principles are designed to keep students actively engaged and help them thrive academically and socially.\n\n**Why Microschools?**  \nThe advent of microschools addresses a significant challenge: conventional education systems often fail to meet the diverse needs of learners, leading to disengagement. Prenda’s unique approach seeks not just to educate but to inspire curiosity, self-discovery, and a lifelong love for learning.\n\n**Impact and Results**  \nParents rave about the transformation their children experience in Prenda microschools. Students previously struggling in traditional settings often regain their confidence and enthusiasm for learning. With tailored education that meets them at their own level, many children advance beyond their previous academic hurdles.\n\n**Ready to Join?**  \nIf you're curious about how to create or join a microschool, Prenda offers easy ways to get started, including detailed guides and workshops. Visit [Prenda's Website](https://prenda.com) to learn more about becoming a guide or to find a microschool in your area.\n\nIn essence, Prenda is not just about education; it’s about community, empowerment, and helping kids rediscover the joy of learning in a way that suits them best."
