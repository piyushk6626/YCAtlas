Our **key differentiator** is that **our AI auto-label the document for you and always seamlessly exports it back in the original format.** This took us 3 years of R&D and could be sold as a standalone product.

Is your support 24/7?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5efe96a2310d7d72045afbda/5efe96a2842de32fed39a2cd_plus-icon-saasy-template.svg)\\nYes.With our premium support package, we offer 24/7 support specifically tailored for Enterprise customers. This comes with a dedicated account manager and technical support team member. For ease of communication we also setup a shared Slack or Teams channel where our team is always available for any requests. This also simplifies the communication of the customer’s feature's requests and bugs reporting. We provide contractual SLA for technical support response time depending on the severity of the case/issue. The highest priority being a 10min acknowledgement of the issue and 1 hour response time. We also offer bi-weekly calls and prioritization of the customer’s feature requests along with access to our roadmap as part of our premium support offering.\\nCan I collaborate on the platform?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5efe96a2310d7d72045afbda/5efe96a2842de32fed39a2cd_plus-icon-saasy-template.svg)\\nCollaboration is one of the significant factors in completing security questionnaires as no one can know everything. Therefore, our solution comes with natively built-in tools that facilitate broad communication and workflow in real time and connected to Slack or Teams. In Skypher software, you can:\\u200d**•****Assign people** who are responsible for particular questions or tasks• **Comment** on questions to give some feedback and ask for help• **Have a notification** on each step of responding to security questionnaires in the channel you prefer.\\nDo you use customer data to train your AI? How does your AI improve over time?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5efe96a2310d7d72045afbda/5efe96a2842de32fed39a2cd_plus-icon-saasy-template.svg)\\nSkypher AI has two ways to improve its accuracy on a specific customer use-case:• We periodically retrain our retrieval algorithm on anonymized customer feedback. Selecting / not selecting an answer gives feedback on our neural network algorithms. You can always opt out this process.• Usage data is also stored at the user / organization level and used at the inference stage to better fit your organization and user behaviors. Especially, our alias system will ensure that if a piece of content is used to answer a specific question, it’ll be proposed again in priority if a similar question is asked in the future. This data isn’t used at all in the training of our algorithm and never leave your account. It is completely deleted if you delete your content / account.\\nCan you use live internal wikis/websites/sources to ingest knowledge based content?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5efe96a2310d7d72045afbda/5efe96a2842de32fed39a2cd_plus-icon-saasy-template.svg)\\nYes, you can integrate live websites and sources to ingest knowledge-based content, including connecting your own wiki or online internal knowledge base / Trust Center.Our system continuously crawls and indexes internal wikis and documentation sites, keeping information current by recursively indexing interconnected web pages. The extracted information is vectorized in our database and leveraged to provide accurate answers. Automated synchronization ensures that any changes in your documentation/pages are detected and the vector database is updated, so responses are always based on the most up-to-date information.\\nDoes Skypher offer SSO?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5efe96a2310d7d72045afbda/5efe96a2842de32fed39a2cd_plus-icon-saasy-template.svg)\\nSkypher seamlessly integrates with all major Single Sign-On (SSO) protocols, including SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect, and Identity Providers such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, etc. to provide a secure and streamlined login experience.\\nIs there a way for me to assess the accuracy or confidence level of your responses?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5efe96a2310d7d72045afbda/5efe96a2842de32fed39a2cd_plus-icon-saasy-template.svg)\\nWe are the only security automation tool on the market immune to hallucinations, delivering over 96% accuracy thanks to our unique proprietary extractive AI technology.

Therefore, our solution comes with natively built-in tools that facilitate broad communication and workflow in real time and connected to Slack or Teams.

Selecting / not selecting an answer gives feedback on our neural network algorithms. You can always opt out this process.• Usage data is also stored at the user / organization level and used at the inference stage to better fit your organization and user behaviors. Especially, our alias system will ensure that if a piece of content is used to answer a specific question, it’ll be proposed again in priority if a similar question is asked in the future. This data isn’t used at all in the training of our algorithm and never leave your account. It is completely deleted if you delete your content / account.\\nCan you use live internal wikis/websites/sources to ingest knowledge based content?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5efe96a2310d7d72045afbda/5efe96a2842de32fed39a2cd_plus-icon-saasy-template.svg)\\nYes, you can integrate live websites and sources to ingest knowledge-based content, including connecting your own wiki or online internal knowledge base / Trust Center.Our system continuously crawls and indexes internal wikis and documentation sites, keeping information current by recursively indexing interconnected web pages.

Automated synchronization ensures that any changes in your documentation/pages are detected and the vector database is updated, so responses are always based on the most up-to-date information.\\nDoes Skypher offer SSO?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5efe96a2310d7d72045afbda/5efe96a2842de32fed39a2cd_plus-icon-saasy-template.svg)\\nSkypher seamlessly integrates with all major Single Sign-On (SSO) protocols, including SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect, and Identity Providers such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, etc. to provide a secure and streamlined login experience.\\nIs there a way for me to assess the accuracy or confidence level of your responses?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5efe96a2310d7d72045afbda/5efe96a2842de32fed39a2cd_plus-icon-saasy-template.svg)\\nWe are the only security automation tool on the market immune to hallucinations, delivering over 96% accuracy thanks to our unique proprietary extractive AI technology.
