My mother suffered from the unfortunate consequence of believing she was in remission when her breast cancer returned unbeknownst to her. ATUSA provides a window into the activity of cancer, and, more importantly, builds from this a cancer profile previously unknown to physicians and patients alike.\\n![Testimonial author](https://isonohealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/lance.jpg)\\nLance M. Black, MD, MBID\\nTMC Innovation Institute\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\nWho is the ATUSA System designed for?\\nInitially, the ATUSA system is aimed at physicians offices and women’s health clinics to allow for fast and convenient whole breast imaging at the point of care. The ATUSA system is fully automated, easy to operate and is meant to be used by physicians, nurses, and medical assistants.\\nWhat are the components of the ATUSA system?\\nThe ATUSA system is made up of a 3D ultrasound scanner, a wearable accessory, a Windows application (desktop and tablet, Windows 7 and higher) for real-time image display, review and measurement and a secure web application for remote viewing with advanced 3D visualization\\nHow does the ATUSA system work?\\nFirst, the patient attaches the wearable accessory and lies on her back. The operator then adjusts the breast tissue, applies coupling medium and attaches the 3D scanner. When the scanner is ready, it can be started from the ATUSA software with the press of a button to automatically image the whole breast volume, which takes approximately two minutes. This procedure can then be repeated on the patient’s other breast.\\nWhere can I try and/or purchase the ATUSA system?\\nPhysicians, women’s health clinics and other relevant health care professionals can get access to the device by registering for a [free demo](http://www.isonohealth.com/<https:/isonohealth.typeform.com/to/HaoFNI>) or registering their interest to [participate in the ATUSA pilot program](http://www.isonohealth.com/<https:/isonohealth.typeform.com/to/rfF7ag>). The ATUSA system is currently only available for investigational use and is not yet available for sale.\\nWhat kind of training is required to use ATUSA?\\nThe ATUSA system does not require a radiologist or ultrasound technologist for image acquisition. ATUSA comes with comprehensive instructional videos for system operation and an initial live demo/training session. However, interpretation of images requires a physician with training in breast ultrasound.\\nHow does the ATUSA scanner connect to my tablet or laptop? Is internet connectivity required to use the System?\\nThe ATUSA system connects to your tablet or laptop via USB and does not require an internet connection.

  "generated_description": "**iSono Health: Revolutionizing Breast Health with AI**\n\nFounded in 2016 and a graduate of Y Combinator's W16 batch, iSono Health is based in San Francisco and specializes in transforming breast health diagnostics. At its core, the company is driven by a clear mission: to make breast health more accessible and personalized through an innovative, AI-powered platform.\n\n**The Technology:**  \n\niSono Health has developed the ATUSA, the world’s first automated 3D breast ultrasound scanner. This device captures entire breast volumes in just two minutes, eliminating the need for trained operators. It works by integrating an automated scanning mechanism with cloud computing and machine learning algorithms to identify abnormal masses using acoustic biomarkers. The compact scanner connects seamlessly to smartphones, tablets, or laptops, with all data securely stored in the cloud for processing.\n\n**Key Benefits:** \n\n1. **Safety First:** There’s no radiation involved with the ATUSA system, making it a safer option compared to traditional imaging methods.\n   \n2. **Speed and Convenience:** The scans take only two minutes, making it ten to fifteen times faster than manual methods. This rapid processing means women can undergo screenings with minimal disruption.\n  \n3. **User-Friendly:** Designed to be operated by healthcare providers at the point of care, the ATUSA system is intuitive enough that it can be utilized even by nurses or medical assistants without extensive training.\n\n4. **AI-Driven Insights:** By leveraging AI, iSono Health provides actionable feedback to both patients and their healthcare providers, enabling early detection and continuous monitoring of breast health.\n\n**The Team:**  \n\niSono Health is driven by a dedicated team of nine employees, including CEO Neda Razavi and Founder/CTO Shadi Saberi. With a strong technical background, they’re committed to improving breast health care accessibility. Their goal is to provide high-risk individuals with regular, personalized monitoring, enhancing patient experience while ensuring peace of mind.\n\n**Market Position and Future:**  \n\nWith a growing emphasis on personalized healthcare, iSono Health is positioned well within the consumer health services and medical device sectors. Supported by key partnerships and innovations, they aim to scale their impact—making breast health screenings and monitoring not just a medical necessity but a simple and routine part of healthcare.\n\nFor more information or to request a demo, visit their website at [iSono Health](http://www.isonohealth.com)."
