  "generated_description": "Linum is a pioneering company that sits at the intersection of text and video, aiming to radically transform how we think about content creation. Founded in 2022 by brothers Sahil and Manu Chopra, Linum is harnessing the power of AI to build state-of-the-art text-to-video diffusion models. Their mission? To allow anyone to \"type text\" and \"dream video,\" democratizing the creation of animated content much like YouTube did for video sharing over the past decade.\n\nSahil, with his strong background in AI, even co-authored a graduate course at Stanford on Large Language Models. Meanwhile, Manu has specialized in Reinforcement Learning applications in healthcare, making them a well-rounded duo with a decade of combined experience. \n\nLinum's headquarters are in San Francisco, where a small but dedicated team of three is hard at work. They are currently part of the Y Combinator Batch W23, where they are honing their product and looking to scale.\n\nThe company anticipates a future where everyday people will generate the majority of animation, TV, and film—a vision they’re actively putting into practice. If you’re interested in what they’re creating, you can sign up for their beta on their website at [linum.ai](https://www.linum.ai/).\n\nIn summary, Linum isn’t just about tech; they’re about enabling creativity and expression for the masses. If you’re intrigued by the potential of text-to-video technology, don’t miss the chance to get in on this ground floor opportunity."
