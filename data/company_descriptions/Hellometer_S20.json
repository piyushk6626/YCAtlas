  "generated_description": "Hellometer is a startup founded in 2020 and hailing from Los Angeles, California. This small but ambitious company, part of Y Combinator's Summer 2020 batch, is on a clear mission: to make fast food even faster. They tackle a significant pain point in the industry—wait times.\n\nThe core idea is straightforward: speed of service is what defines fast food. Yet, owners often lack solid methods to measure and improve it. Hellometer steps in with a solution that harnesses the power of security cameras. By analyzing footage, they pinpoint when and where slowdowns happen in the service process. They have found that every 7 seconds shaved off wait times translates to a 1% increase in revenues. For some fast food chains, that could mean a whopping $30,000 boost annually.\n\nTheir offerings include innovative tools such as the Drive-Thru Timer and Dining Room Timer. These tools allow restaurants to gauge guest experiences accurately—from the moment they arrive to when they receive their food. With cutting-edge AI and computer vision technology, Hellometer not only helps in improving efficiency but also enhances customer satisfaction.\n\nThe team may be small—only 2 employees—but they have a clear focus and a well-defined market. They tap into the burgeoning B2B SaaS and computer vision sectors, making their mark by providing a service that is surprisingly easy to implement. Just put up a camera, and the data starts flowing.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of how they work, take a look at their website: [Hellometer](https://hellometer.io/). Here, they emphasize that their technology can lead to faster wait times—averaging a reduction of 47 seconds—and a smoother overall operation for quick-service restaurants.\n\nIn a nutshell, Hellometer is transforming how fast food restaurants operate, turning wait times from a mystery into a measurable metric that can drive profits. It’s about making the drive-thru convenient and the dining experience smooth, all while keeping an eye on the bottom line."
