  "generated_description": "**Panorama Education: Enhancing Student Success**\n\nFounded in 2012 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S13, Panorama Education is a Boston-based tech company on a mission to improve education for every student. They serve over 2,000 school systems across the United States, impacting 15 million students. What do they do? They're in the business of making data actionable in education. Their platform allows educators to gauge students’ academic and social-emotional strengths and identify those needing extra support.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n### **What They Offer**\n\n1. **Data Tools:** Panorama provides a suite of tools designed to address various aspects of student support. Through surveys focused on school climate and social-emotional learning, they empower schools to cultivate environments where students can thrive.\n   \n2. **Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS):** This framework allows schools to develop effective strategies and interventions tailored to various student needs, promoting a more inclusive educational experience.\n\n3. **Professional Development:** They provide ongoing training and support for educators, helping schools become adept at using data to inform their teaching practices and initiatives.\n\n### **Impact on Education**\n\nPanorama's platform not only aggregates data but also supports educators in interpreting it to take meaningful actions. This means quicker decision-making processes and a more responsive educational environment. In fact, using their tools, schools have reported improvements such as:\n\n- **8 percentile points gain in reading** for middle and high school students.\n- **33% increase in graduation rates** at participating schools.\n- **80% more students feeling a sense of belonging** within their school communities.\n\n### **The Big Picture**\n\nThe company’s focus goes beyond metrics—they're about fostering a supportive network between students, families, and school personnel. Their tools aim to engage families as partners in education, which is critical for holistic student development.\n\n### **Team and Leadership**\n\nWith a team of about 350 employees, Michael Seibel serves as a Group Partner, lending the weight of Y Combinator's experience to their growth journey.\n\n### **Concluding Thoughts**\n\nPanorama Education exemplifies how technology can transform traditional education practices. By intertwining data with caring, personalized education, they are not just improving individual student outcomes but reshaping how schools can engage with their entire student body. If you want to see their impact live, don't miss out on their upcoming demos and resources available on their website: [Panorama Education](https://www.panoramaed.com/). \n\nThey’re not just another SaaS company; they’re on a mission to make education equitable and fulfilling for every student."
