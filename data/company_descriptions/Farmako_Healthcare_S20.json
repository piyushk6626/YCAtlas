  "description": "We are India's fastest medicine delivery service. We deliver medicines in just 30 minutes. We have built highly optimized pharmacy stores and a set of internal tools designed to process prescriptions quickly.\r\n\nWe also provide easy-to-integrate APIs and SDK for anyone to start a virtual pharmacy without needing a license, pharmacy, or delivery fleet. Any doctor, teleconsultation app, or EMR provider can start delivering medicines to their patients on WhatsApp or App using our service in the background. We have more than 80 B2B partners, including India's top teleconsultation apps, EMR providers, hospitals, elderly care apps, and insurance providers.\r\n\nWe operate 24/7 in Gurgaon, New Delhi, and Moradabad and deliver over 15,000 orders monthly. So far, we have processed more than 250K orders and done thousands of life-saving deliveries.\r\n\nWe started in 2020 with the vision to build a centralized health record system for India. We had an AI-powered EMR app for doctors and a SaaS for diagnostic labs to add patients' medical records to Farmako Health ID. We have more than 3M health records added on Farmako. In 2022, the Indian government launched ABHA Health ID and we became one of the first official partners with them. In 2023, we launched quick medicine delivery and decided to move forward with ABHA Health ID for medical records.\r\n\nNow, we are building a safe health assistant inside our medicine delivery app, which will be connected to your Health ID and all your past medical records. Our goal is to make it a super-safe and accurate health assistant for the world, which can eliminate your doctor in the long run for all primary care issues.",

We are the fastest medicine delivery service in India (maybe even in the world). Farmako has a very young team from IIT Roorkee and other top colleges in India. We noticed that there was no service providing on-demand medicines in minutes. While there are great pharmacy services for planned purchases, when it comes to urgent needs, there is no end-to-end service available, and people often have to rely on nearby pharmacies.\\nWhy choose Farmako?\\n  * The fastest medicine delivery\\n  * Get the best discounts\\n  * The best medicine delivery experience\\n  * All medicines available\\n\\n\\nGet up to 20% discount on medicines\\nWe provide some of the best discounts in the market based on the medicine and your order value. As the order value increases, the percentage discount also increases. In most cases, if your order value is above INR 1499 or INR 1999, you get the best discounts. We also offer uncapped discounts. For instance, if you order medicines worth INR 10,000, the discount isn't limited to INR 600 or INR 1000—you can save more than INR 2000-3000 on your order, unlike other pharmacy apps.\\nAwards and recognition\\nFarmako has a team of some of the best professionals from colleges like IIT Roorkee. We were part of the startup accelerator Y Combinator in the Summer 2020 batch. Farmako was included in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia Healthcare companies list in 2022. We have also been featured in The Indian Express, YourStory, Inc42, TechCrunch, and ET Now.\\nOur team and vision\\nOur team consists of around 50 people, including experts in tech, design, sales, and operations, all working together with a vision to solve one of the biggest problems in healthcare. We believe that in a country like India, where medical resources and infrastructure are limited, structured health records can play a major role in addressing many challenges.\\nOur partnered labs and doctors\\nFarmako has partnered with hundreds of diagnostic labs to help them share lab reports with patients in a better way and create a better diagnostics experience. Farmako allows you to book a lab test from any of the partnered labs on Farmako.

We will soon expand to other cities and additional parts of New Delhi in the coming months.\\nOur partnership with Government of India\\nFarmako has partnered with the Government of India and ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission) to officially create ABHA accounts for Indian citizens.

We, as a company, are very serious and responsible when dealing with any layer of data access, even internally. For example, when you share your medical details with us, a pharmacist reviews them.
