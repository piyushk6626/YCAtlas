  "generated_description": "Snackpass is a vibrant startup founded in 2017 and a proud member of Y Combinator's W18 batch. Nestled in the heart of San Francisco, this innovative company has a mission that resonates with food lovers: order ahead at restaurants and earn rewards, especially when you bring your friends along. \n\nThe app, which initially aimed to let users skip the line and send gifts to friends, has evolved into a modern point of sale (POS) system tailored for the next generation of dining experiences.
