I had a terrible time trying to get an appointment with the group my insurance recommended. The health practitioner is knowledgeable and kind, and I feel like I'm getting both good physical and psychological support. \\n#### Adalyn\\nI have ADHD and this format of meeting with providers is very ADHD friendly. It makes it easy to make appointments and the reminds and app are helpful. \\n#### Nathen\\nI find the staff and doctors to be very friendly and helpful. Going with Circle Medical has made treatment for ADHD so much easier for me! \\n#### Emerson\\nI've already recommended it to someone else frustrated by their doctor not taking their ADHD symptoms seriously, which is so often the case. \\n#### Shyla\\nCircle Medical helped me get diagnosed for ADHD. It absolutely changed my life for the better. I've already recommended it to multiple people. Access to affordable care like this is amazing and I want everyone to benefit from it. \\n#### Jewel\\nBecause I felt very heard and wasn't embarrassed or shamed for needing to look into ADD medication in my 30s. \\n#### Jasper\\nIt is a very well organized system, efficient and easy. My provider has specific ADHD training and you let us know how your ADHD program rolls (up front). No one likes surprises. My provider was kind and helpful and I got a follow up on our discussion and what I can do to empower myself NOW. Thanks Circle. \\n#### Cloe\\nSo fast and flexible getting an appointment. As someone with ADHD and anxiety looking for a doctor is a daunting task and keeps you from getting the care you need. They also actually listen to you and what's bothering you, working with you to come up with the best course of action. \\n#### Darryl\\nMy provider heard me out and helped me with my ADHD. I really appreciate how smooth it all was. Y'all are great! \\n#### Katherine\\nLove the convenience of the video consultations for refills on my ADHD medication!!! This is wonderful!!! Also love my health practitioner\u2014 he is fantastic!!! A++++++ \\n#### Sharon\\nThey are quick, professional, and responsive by app. They also take my insurance \u2014 what more can I ask for? \\n#### Matthew\\nMy provider is great. To be honest, for me it started out with wanting to privately get my ADD addressed. But now it is so much more. She seems genuinely concerned about my health and asks questions that help me address and focus on issues as needed. Highly recommend. \\n#### Kyle\\nI have already recommended it to many people. I'm a college student and my university health center has several barriers that make it almost impossible for anyone to afford the services required to get ADHD treatment through them, even with insurance. Circle Medical is convenient and being an app with reminders that I can call from anywhere makes it helpful to remember and make appointments. \\n#### Yvonne\\nThis service is a godsend. I am a single mom of 2 beautiful boys under the age of 5, at home full time as well as working full time. Having the ability to see my provider on a schedule that works for me and takes my insurance is awesome! Thank you guys for all your guidance and support on my journey through life! \\n#### Leland\\nThe scheduling experience is really easy. The provider I chose was on time and she was great. She listened well and I didn't feel rushed or judged. Even though the journey to ask ADHD diagnosis has been a bit scary and anxiety inducing, I left the appointment feeling pretty good about everything. \\n#### Giada\\nJoining Circle Medical has saved my life. I was so lost and didn't know why or what was wrong with me. I took a chance and downloaded the app, and had an appointment in the comfort of my own home within a week. I'm now getting the help I always needed and it has been a game changer. \\n#### Eliza\\nI finally found a provider who cares about me as a patient. She took time to go over my medical history and went to great lengths to go over how ADHD has affected me and we came up with goals that I want to achieve under her care. Medication isn't the only avenue for someone living with ADHD. \\n#### Uriah\\nMy practitioner was extremely friendly and empathetic, and an expert at ADHD and ADD so he knew exactly how to help me and with questions to ask. \\n#### Justin\\nDidn't feel like my last doctor's appointments. My provider felt genuinely compassionate about helping me manage my life obstacles with my ADHD. Was skeptical at first but so glad I made the decision. Super affordable for the quality of care. \\n#### Edwin\\nAs someone who has ADHD, simply setting up an account on the site was so easy. You can tell that this was made with neurodivergent people in mind. Things are just SIMPLE. \\n#### Madalynn\\nThis system, the efficiency, and care behind it is the best that I have come across. I have been uncomfortable addressing issues like ADD and ADHD as an adult, so I put this off for years. My provider has already helped in 2 sessions and I started my prescription within days. I have to say, I am already feeling better simply taking the initial steps. A big thanks to this team! \\n#### Reginald\\nIt has been a good experience for me. If I have any friends or family members who are looking for ADHD help, I will recommend Circle Medical. \\n#### Natalya\\nAs a person with ADHD, going to the doctor in person can be really difficult. I used to put off making appointments because it felt like too many steps and I'd go without seeing a doctor for a few years at a time. Circle Medical allows me to access quality care from home and I never miss my appointments thanks to this convenience. \\n#### Braeden\\nLocally, I've been on a waiting list for seeking an ADHD diagnosis for several months. But then I found this app, and within a few days, it's done! I finally have that peace of mind and can move forward with a treatment plan. Thank you. \\n#### Simone\\nADHD assessment was tailored to adult women. The expert gave nuanced additions and clarification to questions or statements. I feel much better equipped to handle life and am making progress in ways that seemed impossible before. \\n#### June\\nMy provider has been so kind, validating, and understanding. She's helped me understand my ADHD and treat it. \\n#### Zander\\nFinding a good and reliable remote healthcare provider to diagnose and treat ADHD is extremely difficult. Circle Medical has made this process easy for me and I am thankful I chose Circle Medical. \\n#### Immanuel\\nFast and clear appointment and scheduling process. Knowledgeable providers. Responsive support staff. \\n#### Ben\\nMy first interaction with my provider was a positive experience. He listened to my story and we had many things in common. I love having a provider that is also diagnosed with ADHD. This way we can treat my condition properly on a common ground approach. Thank you for being there for me! \\n#### Eric\\nIt is so difficult to access mental health care services right now especially for ADHD, so far I have received immediate and responsive care that has already improved my quality of life, thank you. \\n#### Abdiel\\nHelped me get my ADHD medication renewed when I couldn't find an in-person provider after moving across the country. My provider is amazing and has listened to me, and followed through with my requests beautifully, making sure I'm educated and know what to expect each time I do make a decision/request. \\n#### Camryn\\nMy provider is very professional and knowledgeable about ADHD. She also asks for and listens to my opinions about my treatment. The available hours are convenient. I don't have to take any time off from work. \\n#### Deanna\\nI am very happy with my treatment and my provider has been really great and helpful. I came to Circle from Done, and Circle is far better at patient follow-up and working with me so that I can manage my ADHD in the best way possible. Also, I am very happy with the communication with Circle Medical. \\n#### Van\\nI'm very likely to recommend Circle Medical because of the progress that I have made. My provider has made it possible for me to accept and understand my ADHD with the upmost positivity and total honesty. I have never been able to love and accept myself till now. \\n3,367 more reviews available upon request \\n![Close icon](https://circlemedical.com/_image?href=%2F_astro%2FdarkClose.WOpVBCqE.svg&w=24&h=24&f=svg)\\n## 4.98\\n(1,759) \\nFull names have been changed in compliance with federal patient privacy laws. \\n[ View Providers ](https://circlemedical.com/<https:/booking-v2.circlemedical.com/>) ![Reviews hero](https://circlemedical.com/_image?href=%2F_astro%2FreviewModalHero.FcHaNqJJ.webp&f=webp)\\n##  Real Hormone Therapy patient reviews \\n#### Hailey\\nExcellent bedside manner, honest and trustworthy.

We have flagship clinics in San Francisco, Beverly Hills, and New York City, with more coming soon, and offer limited in-person clinic availability for our established ADHD patients at 24 shared clinic locations. \\nVirtual appointments allow our patients to see their providers in the comfort of their own homes, without the hassle of travel, finding parking, or taking time off of work. Our providers are also able to offer more flexible hours beyond what in-person doctor's offices provide. \\n#  What if I need in-person testing or examinations? \\nFor virtual appointments, if any in-person care is needed, such as bloodwork, vaccinations, or other testing, our providers are able to send the appropriate request to a nearby lab. Results will be integrated with our HIPAA-compliant mobile app so that patients have access to all of their medical records in one secure place. \\n#  How much does this cost me? \\nFor those with insurance, cost will depend on the specific type of care you receive and the coverage of your insurance plan. We provide a cost estimate based on each patient's insurance plan when they book an appointment. \\nFor those without insurance, we provide the self-pay costs of each appointment when a patient is booking their appointment. \\n#  What states do you operate in? \\nTo see our list of currently available states, begin booking an appointment. \\nYou must be currently residing in the state of treatment as well as have your primary pharmacy be in that same state in order to be a patient at our practice. \\nBilling\\n#  How do I know how much my specific appointment will cost? \\nWe provide a cost estimate when you are booking your appointment. For those with insurance, your actual cost is determined after we submit the insurance claim for your appointment. Once we submit the claim, insurance companies will pay for a portion of the appointment and pass on any remaining cost to you. Once we know what this cost is, we will update you with an invoice within the app. \\n#  When do I get charged for my appointment? \\nFor those with insurance, it typically takes 1-3 weeks for the insurance claim to be processed. Once processed, we'll send you an invoice within the app with any remaining costs. You can then opt to pay through the app, or we will automatically charge the payment card on file after 48 hours of sending you the invoice. \\nFor those without insurance (or with out of network insurance), we will send you the invoice 1-2 days after your appointment is completed. You can then opt to pay through the app, or we will automatically charge the payment card on file after 48 hours of sending you the invoice. \\nInsurance\\n#  How long are the appointments? \\nThe first intake appointment is 30 minutes. Follow-up appointments are 20 minutes each. \\n#  What insurance do you accept? \\nWe accept over 1,500+ insurance plans. We cover most of the major PPO insurance companies (payors) across the United States. The best way to confirm coverage of your insurance plan is to begin booking an appointment on our website or via our mobile app. During the booking process, you'll be prompted to enter your insurance information for a real-time verification of your insurance plan. \\n#  What if I am having issues verifying my insurance plan coverage? \\nCall the Member Services number on the back of your insurance card to confirm coverage. You can reference our NPI: 1134596091. For additional assistance, use our in-app chat to message our team. \\n#  What is the total cost of diagnosis and treatment? \\nYour per-appointment costs are set by your insurance plan. If the costs seem high, you may be on a high deductible health plan (HDHP). This means that you have an annual out-of-pocket amount that you must pay on healthcare in a given year before your insurance plan will cover more of your per-appointment costs. \\nIf you are on an HDHP and have confirmed your insurance information in our mobile app, your remaining deductible for the year will be displayed on the \u201cBook Appointment\u201d page. Note that this amount may be outdated if you have had recent insurance claims processed. \\n[ ![Circle Medical Logo](https://circlemedical.com/_image?href=%2F_astro%2Flogo.B6HQVoip.webp&f=webp) ](https://circlemedical.com/</>)\\nMedical services provided by Circle Medical Care of California, an independent medical practice.

I had a terrible time trying to get an appointment with the group my insurance recommended. The health practitioner is knowledgeable and kind, and I feel like I'm getting both good physical and psychological support. \\n#### Adalyn\\nI have ADHD and this format of meeting with providers is very ADHD friendly. It makes it easy to make appointments and the reminds and app are helpful. \\n#### Nathen\\nI find the staff and doctors to be very friendly and helpful. Going with Circle Medical has made treatment for ADHD so much easier for me! \\n#### Emerson\\nI've already recommended it to someone else frustrated by their doctor not taking their ADHD symptoms seriously, which is so often the case. \\n#### Shyla\\nCircle Medical helped me get diagnosed for ADHD. It absolutely changed my life for the better. I've already recommended it to multiple people. Access to affordable care like this is amazing and I want everyone to benefit from it. \\n#### Jewel\\nBecause I felt very heard and wasn't embarrassed or shamed for needing to look into ADD medication in my 30s. \\n#### Jasper\\nIt is a very well organized system, efficient and easy. My provider has specific ADHD training and you let us know how your ADHD program rolls (up front). No one likes surprises. My provider was kind and helpful and I got a follow up on our discussion and what I can do to empower myself NOW. Thanks Circle. \\n#### Cloe\\nSo fast and flexible getting an appointment. As someone with ADHD and anxiety looking for a doctor is a daunting task and keeps you from getting the care you need. They also actually listen to you and what's bothering you, working with you to come up with the best course of action. \\n#### Darryl\\nMy provider heard me out and helped me with my ADHD. I really appreciate how smooth it all was. Y'all are great! \\n#### Katherine\\nLove the convenience of the video consultations for refills on my ADHD medication!!! This is wonderful!!! Also love my health practitioner\u2014 he is fantastic!!! A++++++ \\n#### Sharon\\nThey are quick, professional, and responsive by app. They also take my insurance \u2014 what more can I ask for? \\n#### Matthew\\nMy provider is great. To be honest, for me it started out with wanting to privately get my ADD addressed. But now it is so much more. She seems genuinely concerned about my health and asks questions that help me address and focus on issues as needed. Highly recommend. \\n#### Kyle\\nI have already recommended it to many people. I'm a college student and my university health center has several barriers that make it almost impossible for anyone to afford the services required to get ADHD treatment through them, even with insurance. Circle Medical is convenient and being an app with reminders that I can call from anywhere makes it helpful to remember and make appointments. \\n#### Yvonne\\nThis service is a godsend. I am a single mom of 2 beautiful boys under the age of 5, at home full time as well as working full time. Having the ability to see my provider on a schedule that works for me and takes my insurance is awesome! Thank you guys for all your guidance and support on my journey through life! \\n#### Leland\\nThe scheduling experience is really easy. The provider I chose was on time and she was great. She listened well and I didn't feel rushed or judged. Even though the journey to ask ADHD diagnosis has been a bit scary and anxiety inducing, I left the appointment feeling pretty good about everything. \\n#### Giada\\nJoining Circle Medical has saved my life. I was so lost and didn't know why or what was wrong with me. I took a chance and downloaded the app, and had an appointment in the comfort of my own home within a week. I'm now getting the help I always needed and it has been a game changer. \\n#### Eliza\\nI finally found a provider who cares about me as a patient. She took time to go over my medical history and went to great lengths to go over how ADHD has affected me and we came up with goals that I want to achieve under her care. Medication isn't the only avenue for someone living with ADHD. \\n#### Uriah\\nMy practitioner was extremely friendly and empathetic, and an expert at ADHD and ADD so he knew exactly how to help me and with questions to ask. \\n#### Justin\\nDidn't feel like my last doctor's appointments. My provider felt genuinely compassionate about helping me manage my life obstacles with my ADHD. Was skeptical at first but so glad I made the decision. Super affordable for the quality of care. \\n#### Edwin\\nAs someone who has ADHD, simply setting up an account on the site was so easy. You can tell that this was made with neurodivergent people in mind. Things are just SIMPLE. \\n#### Madalynn\\nThis system, the efficiency, and care behind it is the best that I have come across. I have been uncomfortable addressing issues like ADD and ADHD as an adult, so I put this off for years. My provider has already helped in 2 sessions and I started my prescription within days. I have to say, I am already feeling better simply taking the initial steps. A big thanks to this team! \\n#### Reginald\\nIt has been a good experience for me. If I have any friends or family members who are looking for ADHD help, I will recommend Circle Medical. \\n#### Natalya\\nAs a person with ADHD, going to the doctor in person can be really difficult. I used to put off making appointments because it felt like too many steps and I'd go without seeing a doctor for a few years at a time. Circle Medical allows me to access quality care from home and I never miss my appointments thanks to this convenience. \\n#### Braeden\\nLocally, I've been on a waiting list for seeking an ADHD diagnosis for several months. But then I found this app, and within a few days, it's done! I finally have that peace of mind and can move forward with a treatment plan. Thank you. \\n#### Simone\\nADHD assessment was tailored to adult women. The expert gave nuanced additions and clarification to questions or statements. I feel much better equipped to handle life and am making progress in ways that seemed impossible before. \\n#### June\\nMy provider has been so kind, validating, and understanding. She's helped me understand my ADHD and treat it. \\n#### Zander\\nFinding a good and reliable remote healthcare provider to diagnose and treat ADHD is extremely difficult. Circle Medical has made this process easy for me and I am thankful I chose Circle Medical. \\n#### Immanuel\\nFast and clear appointment and scheduling process. Knowledgeable providers. Responsive support staff. \\n#### Ben\\nMy first interaction with my provider was a positive experience. He listened to my story and we had many things in common. I love having a provider that is also diagnosed with ADHD. This way we can treat my condition properly on a common ground approach. Thank you for being there for me! \\n#### Eric\\nIt is so difficult to access mental health care services right now especially for ADHD, so far I have received immediate and responsive care that has already improved my quality of life, thank you. \\n#### Abdiel\\nHelped me get my ADHD medication renewed when I couldn't find an in-person provider after moving across the country. My provider is amazing and has listened to me, and followed through with my requests beautifully, making sure I'm educated and know what to expect each time I do make a decision/request. \\n#### Camryn\\nMy provider is very professional and knowledgeable about ADHD. She also asks for and listens to my opinions about my treatment. The available hours are convenient. I don't have to take any time off from work. \\n#### Deanna\\nI am very happy with my treatment and my provider has been really great and helpful. I came to Circle from Done, and Circle is far better at patient follow-up and working with me so that I can manage my ADHD in the best way possible.

We have flagship clinics in San Francisco, Beverly Hills, and New York City, with more coming soon, and offer limited in-person clinic availability for our established ADHD patients at 24 shared clinic locations. \\nVirtual appointments allow our patients to see their providers in the comfort of their own homes, without the hassle of travel, finding parking, or taking time off of work. Our providers are also able to offer more flexible hours beyond what in-person doctor's offices provide. \\n#  What if I need in-person testing or examinations? \\nFor virtual appointments, if any in-person care is needed, such as bloodwork, vaccinations, or other testing, our providers are able to send the appropriate request to a nearby lab. Results will be integrated with our HIPAA-compliant mobile app so that patients have access to all of their medical records in one secure place. \\n#  How much does this cost me? \\nFor those with insurance, cost will depend on the specific type of care you receive and the coverage of your insurance plan. We provide a cost estimate based on each patient's insurance plan when they book an appointment. \\nFor those without insurance, we provide the self-pay costs of each appointment when a patient is booking their appointment. \\n#  What states do you operate in? \\nTo see our list of currently available states, begin booking an appointment. \\nYou must be currently residing in the state of treatment as well as have your primary pharmacy be in that same state in order to be a patient at our practice. \\nBilling\\n#  How do I know how much my specific appointment will cost? \\nWe provide a cost estimate when you are booking your appointment. For those with insurance, your actual cost is determined after we submit the insurance claim for your appointment. Once we submit the claim, insurance companies will pay for a portion of the appointment and pass on any remaining cost to you. Once we know what this cost is, we will update you with an invoice within the app. \\n#  When do I get charged for my appointment? \\nFor those with insurance, it typically takes 1-3 weeks for the insurance claim to be processed. Once processed, we'll send you an invoice within the app with any remaining costs. You can then opt to pay through the app, or we will automatically charge the payment card on file after 48 hours of sending you the invoice. \\nFor those without insurance (or with out of network insurance), we will send you the invoice 1-2 days after your appointment is completed. You can then opt to pay through the app, or we will automatically charge the payment card on file after 48 hours of sending you the invoice. \\nInsurance\\n#  How long are the appointments? \\nThe first intake appointment is 30 minutes. Follow-up appointments are 20 minutes each. \\n#  What insurance do you accept? \\nWe accept over 1,500+ insurance plans. We cover most of the major PPO insurance companies (payors) across the United States. The best way to confirm coverage of your insurance plan is to begin booking an appointment on our website or via our mobile app. During the booking process, you'll be prompted to enter your insurance information for a real-time verification of your insurance plan. \\n#  What if I am having issues verifying my insurance plan coverage? \\nCall the Member Services number on the back of your insurance card to confirm coverage. You can reference our NPI: 1134596091. For additional assistance, use our in-app chat to message our team. \\n#  What is the total cost of diagnosis and treatment? \\nYour per-appointment costs are set by your insurance plan. If the costs seem high, you may be on a high deductible health plan (HDHP). This means that you have an annual out-of-pocket amount that you must pay on healthcare in a given year before your insurance plan will cover more of your per-appointment costs. \\nIf you are on an HDHP and have confirmed your insurance information in our mobile app, your remaining deductible for the year will be displayed on the \u201cBook Appointment\u201d page. Note that this amount may be outdated if you have had recent insurance claims processed. \\n ![Circle Medical Logo\u27e8124\u27e9 ](https://circlemedical.com/</>)\\nMedical services provided by Circle Medical Care of California, an independent medical practice.
