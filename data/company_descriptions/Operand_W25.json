  "description": "Operand is building an AI to replace traditional consulting. We help businesses make better decisions by deeply analyzing their data across all sources—something consultants can’t do at scale.\r\n\nWe’re starting in e-commerce and retail, where the businesses’ high data density and real-time feedback loops allow us to show impact fast. Our first capability is pricing and discount strategy. Operand considers everything—competitor pricing, ad strategy, inventory, and more—to ensure businesses maximize profit.\r\n\nAnd unlike other AI solutions, every Operand result is verified by human experts, including ex-MBB consultants, so you get actual impact, not just AI hype.\r\n\nWe’re already generating 6-figure P&L improvements for early customers.",

Operand empowers teams to ask the right questions and deliver insights that drive real results, all while saving time in reporting and analysis.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to up your e-commerce game and make data-driven decisions, Operand might just be the partner you need.\n\nFor more information and to see Operand in action, check out their website: [Try Operand](https://www.tryoperand.com/). \n\n### Tags: \n- Generative AI\n- B2B\n- E-Commerce\n- Retail\n- San Francisco Bay Area\n\nUltimately, Operand is setting a new standard in the way e-commerce brands leverage their data to make informed decisions that lead to growth and success.
