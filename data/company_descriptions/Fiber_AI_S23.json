  "description": "Fiber AI automates SDR and BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI. Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting).\r\n\nOur AI sales platform consists of 3 core components:\r\n\nFirst, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.\r\n\nSecond, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.\r\n\nLastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization—now you don’t have to. We search far and wide to find the “golden nugget” of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.\r\n\nBecause of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.",

  "generated_description": "**Fiber AI: Reinventing Outbound Sales with AI**\n\nFounded in 2023 and nestled in the heart of San Francisco, Fiber AI is on a mission to revolutionize the way Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) and Business Development Representatives (BDRs) approach prospecting and outbound sales. Think of Fiber AI as your intelligent assistant, automating the grind of finding leads and crafting personalized messages that resonate.\n\nAt its core, Fiber AI offers a highly optimized sales platform powered by artificial intelligence. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Email Health Management**: First off, Fiber AI ensures that your emails have an 80% open rate—yes, you read that right. This is achieved by configuring your cold email send-outs with best practices that maximize deliverability. They tackle everything from warming up your email accounts to advanced bounce detection—meaning fewer emails landing in spam and more landing in inboxes.\n\n2. **Dynamic Audience Automation**: The platform isn’t just about sending emails; it’s about sending the right emails to the right people. With access to a database of 60 million B2B companies and 800 million contacts sourced from numerous providers (think LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, and Crunchbase), Fiber AI dynamically segments audiences based on precise targeting criteria. This means you can set it and forget it while the AI continually looks for suitable prospects matching your needs.\n\n3. **AI-Powered Hyper-Personalization**: You know that saying, \"it’s not just what you say, but how you say it\"? Fiber AI takes that to heart. Leveraging advanced models like GPT-4, the platform crafts hyper-personalized messages that connect with prospects on a deeper level. By finding those “golden nuggets” of information, your outreach doesn’t just get opened; it gets responses.\n\nWhat makes Fiber AI stand out is its commitment to maintaining high-quality email interactions while dramatically scaling your team’s outreach efforts. Unlike competitors, whose tools often lead to poor email health or lack the ability to fine-tune personalization, Fiber AI combines scalability with quality.\n\nThe company is part of the Y Combinator Batch S23 and currently operates with a lean team of eight. Their ethos revolves around empowering Sales teams to achieve up to 1000x their output—without sacrificing the personal touch in their communications.\n\nAs Fiber AI picks up momentum, businesses can expect to see a significant boost in their outbound sales efforts. Whether you’re a scrappy startup or a seasoned enterprise, this AI-driven approach might just be the edge you need to connect with prospects like you actually know them. If you’re interested in seeing the magic in action, they invite you to book a demo and explore how Fiber AI can help kick your growth strategy into high gear.\n\nCheck them out at [Fiber AI's website](https://fiber.ai)."
