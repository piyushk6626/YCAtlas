  "description": "With over 500M white-collared job offers rolled out annually, companies find it very difficult to be certain about what to offer. Companies rely on old compensation survey data, which are updated only once every year.\r\n\nThe salary expectations of candidates in the market change significantly on a quarterly basis (~7% statistically) in the startup ecosystem.\r\n\nThis results in more than 50% of qualified/selected candidates not joining the company due to expectation mismatch.\r\n\nCompUp is an API-driven compensation benchmarking tool. We integrate with your existing HR/payroll systems, removing the need for manual data entry, and also getting updated in real-time.\r\n\nCompUp provides the most accurate real-time compensation benchmarking data which helps you make the right offer to the candidate. The platform allows you to make better compensation decisions such as annual increments, candidate offers using internal and external data. \r\n\nThis has the following advantages :\r\n- All the process of compensation data submission is automatic and needs no manual intervention\r\n- Since the job market is dynamic in nature, the offers made on CompUp's real-time benchmarks would be the most efficient\r\n- The presentation of the offer to the candidate makes it look more appealing and explanatory to the candidate",

  "generated_description": "CompUp is a dynamic startup based in Bengaluru, India, founded in 2020 as part of Y Combinator Batch S22. At its core, CompUp is tackling a significant challenge in the hiring ecosystem: the outdated and infrequent nature of compensation data, which leaves companies struggling to make competitive offers. With over 500 million white-collar job offers released annually, many companies are stuck relying on compensation surveys that are updated just once a year. Given that salary expectations in the fast-paced startup environment can change significantly—up to 7% every quarter—this creates a real risk of losing qualified candidates due to mismatched expectations.\n\nEnter CompUp, an API-driven compensation benchmarking tool designed to provide real-time, accurate compensation data integrated smoothly with existing HR and payroll systems. This means no more tedious manual data entry; instead, organizations can access the latest benchmarks effortlessly.
