This isn\\'t a team that sits behind screens all day; they visited us in person, gathered feedback, and **improved the product to better suit our needs**. It\\'s one thing to introduce a tool that people like, but it\\'s another to introduce one that prompts new ways of thinking and adds meaningful value to the educational process.\"\\n\"Most platforms focus solely on either teacher or student, but **Flint** **explicitly caters to the relationship between educators and learners**. Flint is more than just a toolâit\\'s a partner in the classroom that aids in facilitating valuable retrieval practice through immediate feedback.
