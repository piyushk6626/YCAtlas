All you have to do is show up and write down stuff that‚Äôs on your mind. That said, we do have a good mix of hobbyists and professional writers in Foster ‚Äì and in fact, some of us have actually [become pros](https://foster.co/<https:/www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/style/wedding-sheet-cakes-table-long.html>) since joining!\\nWhat does it mean to practice in community?\\nIt means we write together, and we do it often. Right now our weekly Writing Circles primarily take place on Zoom, but we intend to offer in-person circles as our community expands. We also host monthly Cohorts, connect via WhatsApp asynchronously, and get together in person twice a year for retreats.\\nHow do I join Foster?\\nFirst things first, [join one of our Writing Circles](https://foster.co/<https:/tally.so/r/w714J2>) to see if you like it. And then if you‚Äôre interested, you can [join a Cohort](https://foster.co/<https:/www.foster.co/cohorts>).\\nWill Foster help me become a better writer?\\nGetting better at writing is like getting better at anything ‚Äì you have to practice. So we keep our focus on showing up and doing just that. Not because it will do something for our career (though it might!), nor because it will help us gain a ton of followers (though it might do that, too!), but for the sheer joy of it. But yes, to answer your question, if you consistently show up to the practice, you will get better at writing.\\nWill I 10X my productivity as a writer if I join Foster?\\nThat‚Äôs up to you and how often (and how earnestly) you sit down and just do it. That said, people who write with us reliably report breakthroughs in their work. They go deeper, push themselves to try new genres and forms, and publish more often as well.\\nAre you trying to tell me with a straight face that you can make writing easier and more fun?\\nLol it‚Äôs crazy, right? But when you approach it like an experiment and explore what‚Äôs alive and true for you, writing has a way of becoming a lot more enjoyable. Plus, you get that wonderful feeling of clarity and accomplishment when you‚Äôre done writing. It‚Äôs addictive!\\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/660091dc58f2d38047efac50_foster-logo-gray.png)](https://foster.co/</>)\\n[Cohorts](https://foster.co/</cohorts>)[Membership](https://foster.co/</membership>)[Log in](https://foster.co/<https:/app.foster.co/>)\\n[![Substack logo](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/663fb3e1d43ef396ffb6daf0_substack-logo.png)](https://foster.co/<https:/coauthored.co/>)[![X logo](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/663fb370b44dcaec02f94494_x-logo.png)](https://foster.co/<https:/twitter.com/0xFoster>)\\n' markdown_with_citations='![‚ü®1‚ü©](https://foster.co/</>)\\nMembership‚ü®2‚ü©\\n![Substack logo‚ü®3‚ü©]\\n# Find your writing tribe\\nHi, we‚Äôre Foster.

We mix it up with a little bit of practice and a little bit of adventure ‚Äì some of our favorite activities have included yoga, cacao ceremonies, sound healing, aquahara, hiking to waterfalls, surfing, and more.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/66008d075ca456b046fbfd69_image-mandala.jpg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/66008d07179511a669f8c4b7_image-sunset.jpg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/66008d07143b5f99dec6306d_image-shala-circle.jpg)\\n### Community Support\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/65fb87330e81ded4aa88e5fb_icon-whatsapp.png)\\n#### WhatsApp\\nWe love to trade links and discuss all the things worth discussing, and we do that in dedicated WhatsApp channels.\\n![‚ü®5‚ü©Professional EditingLeverage the professional and editors in the Foster collective for thoughtful feedback and edits.](https://foster.co/<https:/app.foster.co>)\\n## Reasons You Might Want to Join Foster\\n  * Start a writing practice or breathe new life into your existing practice. \\n  * Beat back your inner critic and access deeper, more authentic ideas and emotions in your work. \\n  * Explore sensitive and challenging topics in a supportive community. \\n  * Make progress on an idea and/or sustain momentum with your writing projects. \\n  * Stop writing to please others and start writing as a means of expressing yourself and inhabiting new possibilities in your work and life.\\n  * Meet other creative, curious humans in a genuine, earnest, welcoming environment where you feel seen and witnessed in this often lonely pursuit.\\n\\n\\nJoin a Free Writing Circle‚ü®4‚ü©\\n## A Co-Operated Collective\\nWe are a collective of writers, editors, coaches, technologists, metamodern magicians and more who are united by our belief in the transformative, life-affirming power of the written word.

All you have to do is show up and write down stuff that‚Äôs on your mind. That said, we do have a good mix of hobbyists and professional writers in Foster ‚Äì and in fact, some of us have actually become pros‚ü®31‚ü© since joining!\\nWhat does it mean to practice in community?\\nIt means we write together, and we do it often. Right now our weekly Writing Circles primarily take place on Zoom, but we intend to offer in-person circles as our community expands. We also host monthly Cohorts, connect via WhatsApp asynchronously, and get together in person twice a year for retreats.\\nHow do I join Foster?\\nFirst things first, join one of our Writing Circles‚ü®4‚ü© to see if you like it. And then if you‚Äôre interested, you can join a Cohort‚ü®32‚ü©.\\nWill Foster help me become a better writer?\\nGetting better at writing is like getting better at anything ‚Äì you have to practice. So we keep our focus on showing up and doing just that. Not because it will do something for our career (though it might!), nor because it will help us gain a ton of followers (though it might do that, too!), but for the sheer joy of it. But yes, to answer your question, if you consistently show up to the practice, you will get better at writing.\\nWill I 10X my productivity as a writer if I join Foster?\\nThat‚Äôs up to you and how often (and how earnestly) you sit down and just do it. That said, people who write with us reliably report breakthroughs in their work. They go deeper, push themselves to try new genres and forms, and publish more often as well.\\nAre you trying to tell me with a straight face that you can make writing easier and more fun?\\nLol it‚Äôs crazy, right? But when you approach it like an experiment and explore what‚Äôs alive and true for you, writing has a way of becoming a lot more enjoyable. Plus, you get that wonderful feeling of clarity and accomplishment when you‚Äôre done writing. It‚Äôs addictive!\\n![‚ü®33‚ü©](https://foster.co/</>)\\nCohorts‚ü®34‚ü©Membership‚ü®2‚ü©Log in‚ü®35‚ü©\\n![Substack logo‚ü®3‚ü©](https://foster.co/<https:/coauthored.co/>)![X logo‚ü®36‚ü©](https://foster.co/<https:/twitter.com/0xFoster>)\\n' references_markdown='\\n\\n## References\\n\\n‚ü®1‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/65fa5c9eb3cc0c029164d3ce_foster-logo-lockup.svg: ![\\n‚ü®2‚ü© https://foster.co/</membership>: Membership\\n‚ü®3‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/663fb3e1d43ef396ffb6daf0_substack-logo.png: Substack logo\\n‚ü®4‚ü© https://foster.co/<https:/tally.so/r/w714J2>: Join a Free Writing Circle\\n‚ü®5‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/65fb8733fd3ca0bccfb03894_icon-professional-editing.png: ![\\n‚ü®6‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/6600a9f9d563105ac643e6af_image-steward-dan.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®7‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/663fbb8ea6fe9a26f97d4e64_sara-campbell.png: ![\\n‚ü®8‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/6600a9f93ccf390baa799bd1_image-steward-minnow.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®9‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/6600a9f9e9c8c82134cc9b2c_image-steward-steph.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®10‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/6600a9f9685e4750b36d9eba_image-steward-lyle.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®11‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade5f5562151b3f8cad3_alicia-bonner.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®12‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade59f8fb2df9fd6243c_amanda-azadian.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®13‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade5f6779437260f20b5_anthony-pica.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®14‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade5bf0df3a983a45faa_april-resnick.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®15‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade5a048a66f817428df_cassandra-ellis.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®16‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade535c2525cc55f5db3_danver-chandler.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®17‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade59793199d21981d28_dylan-tweney.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®18‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade5541a6b44fb621fda_indigo-habel.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®19‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade53b066142184f5388_jasmine-pierik.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®20‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade5873014ede3952f73_jesse-evers.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®21‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade57c162ee164fecd14_jg.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®22‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade6f3b66246b64fc237_jude-klinger.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®23‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade60489d0185de5d720_joel-christiansen.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®24‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade6f3b66246b64fc22d_melody-song.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®25‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade6e89af2b4fc073de3_nicholas-goodey.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®26‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/664fade61c8257e0967f8aa1_nicholas-forero.jpg: ![\\n‚ü®27‚ü© https://foster.co/<https:/coauthored.co/>: CoAuthored\\n‚ü®28‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/6600bd4dcaf91db80a8851d3_image-article-discovering.webp: ![\\n‚ü®29‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/6600be31fe28188d943603e3_image-article-high.webp: ![\\n‚ü®30‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/6600be4e72c2673924933997_image-article-typist.webp: ![\\n‚ü®31‚ü© https://foster.co/<https:/www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/style/wedding-sheet-cakes-table-long.html>: become pros\\n‚ü®32‚ü© https://foster.co/<https:/www.foster.co/cohorts>: join a Cohort\\n‚ü®33‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/660091dc58f2d38047efac50_foster-logo-gray.png: ![\\n‚ü®34‚ü© https://foster.co/</cohorts>: Cohorts\\n‚ü®35‚ü© https://foster.co/<https:/app.foster.co/>: Log in\\n‚ü®36‚ü© https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65fa57196af60d82922043cc/663fb370b44dcaec02f94494_x-logo.png: ![X logo\\n' fit_markdown='' fit_html=''",
