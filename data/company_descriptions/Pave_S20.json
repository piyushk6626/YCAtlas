When all the elements tie together and it’s set up properly, particularly with the permissioning and ability to ensure the right people can see the right things, Comp Planning makes a big difference for us. It’s a much, much better process than anything we could do with spreadsheets—and we did try (it was not pretty).\\nJacob Wallenberg\\nVP, People & Talent, Ramp \\n![Ramp](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63722fa7f631896277feb5c6/6786c49b6b3adc7dbbf05100_jacob%20wallenberg.jpeg)\\nI have found [Market Data] quite useful for pricing jobs in places where I have few employees.

When all the elements tie together and it’s set up properly, particularly with the permissioning and ability to ensure the right people can see the right things, Comp Planning makes a big difference for us. It’s a much, much better process than anything we could do with spreadsheets—and we did try (it was not pretty).\\nJacob Wallenberg\\nVP, People & Talent, Ramp \\n![Ramp⟨34⟩]\\nI have found [Market Data] quite useful for pricing jobs in places where I have few employees. It is also a good sense to check against legacy market providers.\\nNeil Pfeiffer\\nSenior Manager Global Compensation, Workato\\n![Workato⟨35⟩]\\nPave has been invaluable in streamlining our compensation processes, enabling us to enhance transparency, drive employee engagement, and improve retention. With Pave’s data-driven approach, we’ve been able to make more strategic decisions around compensation, which has had a direct impact on our company\\'s growth and ability to retain top talent. \\nEvan Salisbury\\nVP of Total Rewards & People Support, Ancestry\\n![Ancestry⟨36⟩]\\nI appreciate Pave’s real-time insights, along with the capability to easily filter for relevant peer data to ensure our team stays informed and agile.\\nLeah Springer\\nDirector of Global Compensation, Grammarly\\n![Grammarly⟨37⟩]\\nPave\\'s Market Pricing tool increased my confidence in explaining how our compensation bands were developed.

Even small changes would take a lot of time. With Market Pricing from Pave, we can view all our market data and encode our comp philosophy, enabling us to reprice faster with more confidence.\\nYvonne Liu\\nSenior Manager, Compensation, Clio\\n![Clio⟨39⟩]\\nWith Pave, we can offer transparency for managers in terms of how they should reward employees and also how they can responsibly allocate their budget.

  "generated_description": "**Pave - Elevating Compensation Management**\n\nFounded in 2019 and hailing from San Francisco, Pave is reshaping how companies handle compensation. Remember a time when spreadsheets were the norm for managing salaries and equity? Pave aims to obliterate that old world. Their mission? To allow businesses to plan, communicate, and benchmark their compensation in real-time, making smarter decisions powered by seamless integrations with HRIS, ATS, and Cap Tables.\n\nAfter being part of Y Combinator’s Batch S20, Pave has grown into a robust company with a team of 170 employees. The platform’s backbone is its real-time data, helping over 8,500 companies benchmark against a staggering 1,000,000 employee records—in fact, they manage a total compensation data pool worth $186 billion. \n\nAt its core, Pave addresses a critical business need: compensation is often the largest expense a company faces. With its features like **Market Data**, **Compensation Planning**, **Benchmarking**, and **Total Rewards**, Pave provides an end-to-end solution, enabling HR teams to manage compensation more efficiently and transparently. This is not just a nice-to-have; it’s crucial in a talent market where offering competitive salaries isn't just beneficial—it's essential.\n\nSome standout features of Pave include:\n- **Real-Time Comparisons:** With data flowing in from over 7,500 HRIS integrations, companies can quickly access current salary and equity benchmarks.\n- **Flexible Compensation Workflows:** Businesses can tailor their compensation strategies to match unique employee needs and market conditions.\n- **Intuitive Communication Tools:** Pave enhances clarity around compensation structures, enabling effective discussions from the C-suite down to individual contributors.\n\nPave is touted by industry leaders. For instance, Jacob Wallenberg from Ramp highlights how their Compensation Planning tool significantly improved their processes compared to cumbersome spreadsheets. Others, like Leah Springer of Grammarly, praise Pave’s real-time insights, which keep teams agile and informed. The strength of Pave lies not just in data but also in how it empowers organizations to make informed, strategic decisions regarding their most valuable asset: their people.\n\nInterested in diving deeper? Check out Pave’s services on their [website](https://pave.com). In an era where every competitive edge counts, managing compensation smarter with Pave might just be the game-changer your organization needs."
