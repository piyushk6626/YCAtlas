If, when, I get very busy and do not have the time to do my medical notes right away, the dictation from using VetRec is there.

  "generated_description": "### VetRec: Redefining Veterinary Care with AI\n\n**Overview:**\nFounded in 2023 and based in Seattle, WA, VetRec is revolutionizing how veterinarians manage clinical notes. As part of the Y Combinator Batch S23, this innovative startup aims to enhance patient care by saving valuable time—time that should be spent focused on the animals, not on paperwork. \n\n**Mission:**\nAt its core, VetRec's mission is to serve as an AI-powered scribe specifically designed for veterinarians. The idea is straightforward: if veterinary consultations are precious, the time spent on note-taking should be slashed. VetRec automates the generation of clinical notes in mere seconds, allowing vets to concentrate on what truly matters—caring for pets.\n\n**How It Works:**\nThe process is simple:\n1. **Record** the consultation with a click of a button.\n2. Let VetRec **process** the session, either using built-in templates or customizable SOAP formats.\n3. Within **30 seconds**, have the generated notes ready for review and integration into your practice management system (PiMS).\n\nThis setup isn't just about taking notes faster; it’s about accuracy and efficiency, minimizing the mental load on veterinarians during and after consultations.\n\n**Team and Support:**\nVetRec is powered by a small but mighty team of 8 employees, with guidance from Group Partner Aaron Epstein. The team is known for its responsiveness and commitment to improving the platform based on user feedback, which is vital in a field where every second counts.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Comprehensive AI Integration:** VetRec not only records conversations but also processes them intelligently, creating a seamless workflow from consultation to documentation.\n- **Custom Templates:** Users can choose from over 35 templates or design their own, tailoring the notes to suit varying needs and specialties.\n- **Patient History Summarization:** Summarize extensive patient histories—up to 1500 pages—bringing together all necessary information in one concise document.\n- **Two-Way PiMS Integration:** Effortlessly export notes to designated PiMS platforms with a single click, enhancing workflow efficiency even further.\n\n**Pricing:**\nVetRec adopts a straightforward pricing model:\n- **$149/month** for individual veterinarians or clinics per vet, with a two-week free trial.\n- Discounts are available for non-profits and relief work, showcasing a commitment to accessibility in veterinary care.\n\n**Feedback and Testimonials:**\nVeterinarians using VetRec praise its accuracy and the freedom it offers during consultations. Users report feeling more present with their patients and less encumbered by the administrative burden of record-keeping.\n\n**Get Started:**\nFor veterinarians looking to simplify their workflow, VetRec offers a free trial sign-up at [vetrec.io](https://vetrec.io). The platform is designed to work across devices, necessitating no special equipment—a simple microphone suffices to start recording.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nVetRec isn't just another software tool; it's a transformative approach to veterinary practice, blending technology with compassion. By streamlining the note-taking process, VetRec empowers veterinarians to focus on what truly matters: the health and well-being of the pets they serve."
