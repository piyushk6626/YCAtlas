Our software is designed with those challenges in mind. We\\'re one system created to work across all of your development teams without the steep learning curve. \\nInvest in your software just as you would invest in your team. With continuous innovation, we\\'re that partner that you can rely on. We\\'re with you \\'til the end, we promise. \\nWe Giveffect about you.\\nThe greatest thing about Giveffect is that everything is in one system. When we were considering which nonprofit software to use, the four key things we were looking for was a volunteer management database, donor management database, online giving system and registration forms. We were really looking for a CRM database that was able to spit out reports and had an easy way for importing data. What I also liked was the e-marketing piece because we can track the data that comes in for everything the donors give and market them with a newsletter. It’s also really easy with the Giveffect nonprofit software to spin out a thank you notes and issue tax receipts. Then we follow-up with our Goodwill donors with a phone call. \\nKlassie Alcine, Director of Community Engagement - Goodwill of Western Missouri & Eastern Kansas\\nBy switching to Giveffect we have eliminated having to use multiple non-profit platforms to function. Everything was separate for us before and we basically were spending a ton of time moving between nonprofit software, platforms and systems that didn\\'t communicate well together and/or did not allow us to present the look and feel of our non-profit organization. With Giveffect, we can easily accomplish all of our tasks from one non-profit software AND on the frontend of things it integrates seamlessly with our own Big Brothers Big Sisters website! \\nKris Hoxie, Office Manager - Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwestern Michigan\\nWe are using Giveffect to manage our database of contacts, our donor relationships, our fundraising efforts, and our volunteer engagement. We’re using Giveffect as a one-stop-shop for our entire ministry - from Family Partnership to Partner Family Mortgage Management to Community Outreach/Volunteerism to Marketing and Communications. We were in much the same situation as many nonprofits - using a dozen services that we had to reconcile together (and pay for separately). We were missing out on engagement opportunities left and right because data was everywhere and making sense of it all collectively was a seemingly impossible task. \\nKevin Miller, Director of Marketing and Communications - Habitat for Humanity East Central Ohio\\nMy Development Director had left and we didn\\'t even have to hire another person to replace that position. Giveffect is really easy to use! With our previous software, we’d spent hours on hours to make an event website, then we’d put stuff into the CRM and it would always mess up. Giveffect is so user-friendly, even our 70 year old CFO can run with Giveffect. \\nAbbey Scott, Chief Executive Officer - Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwest Wyoming\\nWe wanted a system that looked better with more functionality in the database’s backend! The Smart Automation piece that goes on behind the scenes made a larger scale impact on my workload when it came to automating administrative tasks and reporting.\"\\nMartin Mai - Development Director, UCLA Unicamp\\nAs we transition from our last donor database to Giveffect, it is very refreshing to know there is help just a click away when we get stuck. Compared to our last database, the potential this system has is far superior and I\\'m excited to explore and learn of all the options it has to offer. The on-line chat service to help navigate through the system is outstanding. Being one of those who is not technologically savvy, the tutorials and online help have made this transition super easy. I am so thrilled to have been a part of this transition with Giveffect right there ready to help. \\nDeanna Deering, Director of Special Events/Community Outreach - Boys & Girls Clubs of the Los Angeles Harbor\\nThe most helpful part of Giveffect is that everything is under one platform. I can look at a profile and know exactly how that individual is interacting with our organization from emails, interactions, donations, volunteer hours and survey responses! It\\'s also very helpful that the event software and forms are integrated into the platform. The donation forms are easy to use and you can set up campaigns very quickly that will help increase support for your initiatives. We have also been impressed with the reporting feature - it has allowed us to track a lot of different analytics quickly that we weren\\'t able to do with our previous CRM. \\nMelissa Jones, Development Manager - Habitat for Humanity of Kansas City\\nGiveffect has been a life saver. It is easy to use and I love that the software has email capability, online giving, relationship management tracking and great reports. I like having the ability to do many business processes in one system. Ease of use was incredibly important. Giveffect\\'s team members were great with onboarding and set up. \\nMichael Fuller, Executive Director - Foundation for the Los Angeles Community Colleges\\nEven though I have searched through other options of CRM databases for our nonprofit, Giveffect is just one place that can do everything we need. There\\'s no hassle with multiple accounts; everything is built right in. It makes managing our contacts and reaching out so much easier! Scheduled, constant communication with our donors and making it personalized using gathered data from click and open rates. It causes the donor to keep coming back, or re-engage them again after a lapse in giving. \\nKasey Lofties, Development Manager - York Habitat for Humanity\\nGiveffect is a very efficient place to keep all of our donor contact information. Working at a non-profit, we utilize Giveffect to keep our donations organized, send out upcoming event invites, and manage our website. Giveffect has a very excellent support team that is always willing to answer questions for us in a very timely manner. Giveffect has helped our company thrive by keeping all of our important data and contact information secure. \\nAndrea Lacey, Program Director - No Limits for Deaf Children\\n[More reviews ](http://giveffect.com/</clients>)\\n####  Boost Your Nonprofit\\'s Success! \\nSubscribe to receive expert insights, exclusive invites to events and webinars, plus inspiring resources – all delivered directly to your inbox.\\nReady to get downto business?\\n[Schedule a Call](http://giveffect.com/</schedule-a-call>)\\n![Giveffect Logo](http://giveffect.com/home_v2/images/giveffect-logo.png)\\nGiveffect gives your nonprofit the technology you need to succeed in today\\'s fast-paced environment. \\n  * [Testimonials](http://giveffect.com/</clients>)\\n  * [Terms of Use](http://giveffect.com/</terms-of-use-agreement>)\\n  * [Privacy](http://giveffect.com/</privacy-policy>)\\n  * [Security](http://giveffect.com/</security>)\\n  * [Careers](http://giveffect.com/</careers>)\\n  * [Contact Sales](http://giveffect.com/</schedule-a-call>)\\n  * Contact Support\\n\\n\\n[](http://giveffect.com/<https:/www.twitter.com/giveffect>) [](http://giveffect.com/<https:/www.facebook.com/giveffect>) [](http://giveffect.com/<https:/www.instagram.com/giveffect>) [](http://giveffect.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/giveffect>)\\n© 2025 Giveffect, Inc. \\n' markdown_with_citations=' ![Giveffect Logo⟨1⟩ ![Giveffect Logo⟨2⟩] ](http://giveffect.com/</>)\\n  * Features⟨3⟩\\n    * Online Giving⟨4⟩\\n    * Volunteering⟨5⟩\\n    * Events & Fundraising⟨6⟩\\n      * Ticket Sales⟨7⟩\\n      * Peer-to-Peer Fundraisers⟨8⟩\\n      * Team Fundraisers⟨9⟩\\n      * Auction Fundraising Software⟨10⟩\\n      * Third Party Fundraisers⟨11⟩\\n    * Relationship Management⟨12⟩\\n    * Nonprofit Management⟨13⟩\\n    * Membership Management⟨14⟩\\n    * Marketing & Communications⟨15⟩\\n    * Donor Moves Management⟨16⟩\\n    * Grant Management⟨17⟩\\n    * Nonprofit Analytics⟨18⟩\\n    * Wealth Screening⟨19⟩\\n    * Websites & Web Hosting⟨20⟩\\n    * Smart Automation⟨21⟩\\n  * Learn More⟨3⟩\\n    *  Webinars & Events ⟨22⟩\\n    *  Client Case Studies ⟨23⟩\\n    *  Resource Center ⟨22⟩\\n    *  Software Grant ⟨24⟩\\n    *  FAQ ⟨25⟩\\n  * Pricing⟨26⟩\\n  *  Login⟨27⟩\\n\\nSchedule a Call⟨28⟩\\nThe most successful nonprofits run on Giveffect\\nAn all-in-one platform to grow and automate your nonprofit.\\nTry It Free for 14 Days⟨29⟩ 5 / 5 ratings on Capterra & G2\\n# Grow Your Organization with Giveffect: The 10-in-One Nonprofit Software\\nNonprofit software that connects and automates your organization.

With Giveffect, we can easily accomplish all of our tasks from one non-profit software AND on the frontend of things it integrates seamlessly with our own Big Brothers Big Sisters website! \\nKris Hoxie, Office Manager - Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwestern Michigan\\nWe are using Giveffect to manage our database of contacts, our donor relationships, our fundraising efforts, and our volunteer engagement. We’re using Giveffect as a one-stop-shop for our entire ministry - from Family Partnership to Partner Family Mortgage Management to Community Outreach/Volunteerism to Marketing and Communications. We were in much the same situation as many nonprofits - using a dozen services that we had to reconcile together (and pay for separately). We were missing out on engagement opportunities left and right because data was everywhere and making sense of it all collectively was a seemingly impossible task. \\nKevin Miller, Director of Marketing and Communications - Habitat for Humanity East Central Ohio\\nMy Development Director had left and we didn\\'t even have to hire another person to replace that position. Giveffect is really easy to use! With our previous software, we’d spent hours on hours to make an event website, then we’d put stuff into the CRM and it would always mess up. Giveffect is so user-friendly, even our 70 year old CFO can run with Giveffect. \\nAbbey Scott, Chief Executive Officer - Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwest Wyoming\\nWe wanted a system that looked better with more functionality in the database’s backend! The Smart Automation piece that goes on behind the scenes made a larger scale impact on my workload when it came to automating administrative tasks and reporting.\"\\nMartin Mai - Development Director, UCLA Unicamp\\nAs we transition from our last donor database to Giveffect, it is very refreshing to know there is help just a click away when we get stuck. Compared to our last database, the potential this system has is far superior and I\\'m excited to explore and learn of all the options it has to offer. The on-line chat service to help navigate through the system is outstanding. Being one of those who is not technologically savvy, the tutorials and online help have made this transition super easy. I am so thrilled to have been a part of this transition with Giveffect right there ready to help. \\nDeanna Deering, Director of Special Events/Community Outreach - Boys & Girls Clubs of the Los Angeles Harbor\\nThe most helpful part of Giveffect is that everything is under one platform. I can look at a profile and know exactly how that individual is interacting with our organization from emails, interactions, donations, volunteer hours and survey responses! It\\'s also very helpful that the event software and forms are integrated into the platform. The donation forms are easy to use and you can set up campaigns very quickly that will help increase support for your initiatives. We have also been impressed with the reporting feature - it has allowed us to track a lot of different analytics quickly that we weren\\'t able to do with our previous CRM. \\nMelissa Jones, Development Manager - Habitat for Humanity of Kansas City\\nGiveffect has been a life saver. It is easy to use and I love that the software has email capability, online giving, relationship management tracking and great reports. I like having the ability to do many business processes in one system. Ease of use was incredibly important. Giveffect\\'s team members were great with onboarding and set up. \\nMichael Fuller, Executive Director - Foundation for the Los Angeles Community Colleges\\nEven though I have searched through other options of CRM databases for our nonprofit, Giveffect is just one place that can do everything we need. There\\'s no hassle with multiple accounts; everything is built right in. It makes managing our contacts and reaching out so much easier! Scheduled, constant communication with our donors and making it personalized using gathered data from click and open rates. It causes the donor to keep coming back, or re-engage them again after a lapse in giving. \\nKasey Lofties, Development Manager - York Habitat for Humanity\\nGiveffect is a very efficient place to keep all of our donor contact information. Working at a non-profit, we utilize Giveffect to keep our donations organized, send out upcoming event invites, and manage our website. Giveffect has a very excellent support team that is always willing to answer questions for us in a very timely manner. Giveffect has helped our company thrive by keeping all of our important data and contact information secure. \\nAndrea Lacey, Program Director - No Limits for Deaf Children\\nMore reviews ⟨50⟩\\n####
