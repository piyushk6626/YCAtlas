It saves veterinary professionals time, allowing them to focus more on their patients.\\n  * Does Vetnio replace my EMR/PIMS?\\nNo, Vetnio doesn\\'t replace your existing system; on the contrary, we make working with your current system easier.\\n  * How does it work?\\nVetnio\\'s set up before the patient meeting. The meeting takes place as usual. After the meeting, the recording stops, and a clinical note and communication are generated automatically. The texts can easily be edited if you\\'re not satisfied; if you are, you can just pull them from Vetnio and into your system.\\n  * Do I need to speak in a special way?\\nWith Vetnio, you can run your appointments just like you normally do - there\\'s no need to change a thing. Our AI automatically filters out irrelevant conversations. Unlike many other voice-to-text tools, you won\\'t have to spell out medical terms or dictate punctuation, among other things.\\n  * Do I need any extra equipment to use Vetnio?\\nNo, Vetnio can be used on everything from mobile phones to computers, and it doesn\\'t require you to download anything or acquire any physical equipment. However, the better sound recording capability your device has, the better the results will be.\\n  * What is a penetration test?\\nAn independent penetration test is a costly method for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in systems within a controlled environment, so attackers can\\'t exploit them later. We bring in external teams of recognized security experts for this.\\n\\n\\n### Interested in learning more?\\nPlease fill out the form, and we\\'ll get back to you shortly.\\nSend\\nAI Solutions Shaping the Future of Veterinary Care.\\nSign up for our newsletter and stay updated\\nSubscribe\\n  * [](https://vetnio.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/vetnio/posts/?feedView=all>)\\n\\n\\n#### Home\\n  * [Features](https://vetnio.com/</home/en/features>)\\n  * [Data & Safety](https://vetnio.com/</home/en/data-and-safety>)\\n  * [About Us](https://vetnio.com/</home/en/about-us>)\\n  * [Recruitment](https://vetnio.com/<#>)\\n  * [Contact Us](https://vetnio.com/<#contact>)\\n\\n\\n#### Compliance\\n  * [Impressum](https://vetnio.com/</home/en/impressum>)\\n\\n\\n#### Product\\n  * [Pricing](https://vetnio.com/<#>)\\n  * [Changelog](https://vetnio.com/<#>)\\n  * [Resource Centre](https://vetnio.com/<#>)\\n\\n\\n#### Home\\n  * [Features](https://vetnio.com/</home/en/features>)\\n  * [Data & Safety](https://vetnio.com/</home/en/data-and-safety>)\\n  * [About Us](https://vetnio.com/</home/en/about-us>)\\n  * [Recruitment](https://vetnio.com/<#>)\\n  * [Contact Us](https://vetnio.com/<#contact>)\\n\\n\\n#### Compliance\\n  * [Impressum](https://vetnio.com/</home/en/impressum>)\\n\\n\\n#### Product\\n  * [Pricing](https://vetnio.com/<#>)\\n  * [Changelog](https://vetnio.com/<#>)\\n  * [Resource Centre](https://vetnio.com/<#>)\\n\\n\\nSign up for our newsletter and stay updated\\nSubscribe\\n© 2024 Vetnio.

  "generated_description": "**Vetnio: Streamlining Veterinary Administration with AI**\n\nFounded in 2024 and a proud participant in Y Combinator's W25 batch, Vetnio is on a mission to revolutionize how veterinary professionals manage their administrative tasks. With an impressive insight that veterinarians spend around 40% of their time on administrative work, including over 20% just on note-taking, Vetnio aims to free them up to focus where it really counts — caring for animals.\n\nLocated in an undisclosed location with a tight-knit team of 8, Vetnio utilizes artificial intelligence to simplify the note-taking process during veterinary consultations. Picture this: a veterinarian can just conduct their meeting as usual, and at the end, Vetnio's technology automatically generates comprehensive clinical notes. This not only saves time but also enhances accuracy in record-keeping without the need for disruptive procedural changes.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Automatic Note Generation**: Virtually eliminates the tedious task of manually documenting meetings. \n- **User-Friendly**: Can seamlessly integrate with existing electronic medical records and practice management systems without replacing them.\n- **Accessibility**: Operates across devices, from mobile phones to computers, making it easy to use without special equipment.\n- **GDPR-Compliant**: With a strong focus on data privacy, all data is stored within the EU, ensuring compliance with regulations. \n\n### Why Vetnio Matters:\nPet care professionals are dedicated to their craft; however, the burden of administration has historically taken a toll on their efficiency and effectiveness. By integrating Vetnio's system, veterinarians can reclaim precious time, allowing them to devote more energy to their patients. \n\nBacked by Y Combinator and led by Group Partner Gustaf Alstromer, Vetnio is set to make a significant impact in the veterinary field by leveraging technology to bring a vital change in how veterinary care is delivered.\n\nYou can explore more about Vetnio and their innovative solutions at [vetnio.com](https://vetnio.com). \n\nIn a nutshell, Vetnio is about pushing boundaries in veterinary care, where the focus should be on healing, not paperwork. That's a goal worth pursuing."
