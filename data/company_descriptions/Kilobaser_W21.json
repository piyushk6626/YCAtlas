  "generated_description": "**Kilobaser Overview**\n\n**Founded:** 2014  \n**Location:** Graz, Austria  \n**Team Size:** 10 Employees  \n**Y Combinator Batch:** W21  \n**Website:** [Kilobaser](https://www.kilobaser.com)\n\n---\n\n**Mission & Vision**  \nKilobaser is on a clear mission to democratize access to DNA synthesis with its innovative product: the **Kilobaser One-XT**, the first microfluidic chip and cartridge-based personal DNA and RNA synthesizer. This device aims to revolutionize laboratory practices by allowing life scientists to synthesize custom DNA right at their benchtops—no more waiting for outsourced services. Think of it as the **Nespresso Machine for DNA**. \n\n**The Problem**  \nTraditionally, researchers faced long delays and inflated costs when outsourcing DNA synthesis. This bottleneck has stifled innovation in life sciences. Kilobaser aims to empower researchers by putting the power of DNA synthesis in their hands, significantly speeding up the research process.\n\n**Product Offerings**  \nKilobaser’s main product is the **Kilobaser One-XT**, which enables users to create custom DNA and RNA on-demand quickly, efficiently, and independently.
