  "generated_description": "Actipulse Neuroscience is a pioneering company specializing in non-invasive brain stimulation technologies, particularly aimed at treating psychiatric and neurological disorders. Founded in 2017 and based in Cambridge, MA, Actipulse is part of the Y Combinator W22 batch and employs a dedicated team of 38 people. Their mission is ambitious yet straightforward: to bring non-invasive brain stimulation from a hospital setting into the comfort of patients' homes. \n\nTraditionally, brain stimulation treatments like these have been restricted to clinical environments due to the complexity and high costs associated with the devices. However, Actipulse has developed a proprietary device that allows patients to receive effective treatment at home, significantly reducing the treatment's cost while maintaining efficacy.\n\nCurrently, the company is in a pivotal phase of FDA testing for its technology targeting Major Depressive Disorder and is also conducting pilot studies for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The vision is clear—Actipulse aims to become the golden standard for neuromodulation technologies, helping millions suffering from these debilitating conditions within the next five years.\n\nTheir work is backed by the Paris Brain Institute, positioning them as a leader in the neurotechnology space, with a strong commitment to ethical and clinical research standards. Beyond just treating symptoms, Actipulse is also focused on addressing the neglected pathogenic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nFor more details, check out their website [Actipulse Neuroscience](http://www.actipulseneuroscience.com). The company is geared towards a future where treatment is not only effective but also accessible, transforming the landscape of mental health and neurodegenerative disorder therapies."
