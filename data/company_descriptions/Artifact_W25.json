  "generated_description": "Artifact is positioning itself as a game-changer in the realm of electrical design, launched in 2025 from Atlanta, GA. Initially developed as a 2D CAD tool, it leverages the power of AI to free designers from monotonous and error-prone tasks like datasheet ingestion, system design, and documentation. The mission here is clear: to create a modern workspace that elevates electrical design from concept all the way to detailed products.\n\nThe startup is part of Y Combinator's Batch W25, which is really a badge of honor and highlights its innovative potential. With a tiny but mighty team of just two employees, co-founders Antony Samuel and Corbin Klett, they embody the passionate spirit of startup culture. Antony, with his background in avionics for high-speed aircraft, and Corbin, an aerospace PhD from Georgia Tech, bring a wealth of knowledge to the table.\n\nArtifact’s platform supports multi-fidelity design—meaning you can choose the level of detail you need at any point in your project. Whether you're drafting a schematic or generating pinout tables, Artifact allows for an adaptable workflow without constraining creativity. Their AI component, dubbed an \"Engineering Copilot,\" assists with many mundane tasks, enabling engineers to focus on what truly matters: innovation and design excellence.\n\nIf you’re an electrical engineer looking to streamline your design process, Artifact might just be the tool you need. You can check out their website at [artifact.engineer](https://www.artifact.engineer/) to learn more, join their waitlist, or book a demo.\n\nIn summary, Artifact is almost like a conversation between tradition and technology, aiming to revolutionize how electrical systems are designed and built. In a landscape where complexity is the norm, Artifact is striving to simplify your workflow, allowing for creativity and precision to coexist in perfect harmony."
