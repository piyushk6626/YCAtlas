The mission is simple yet profound: to ensure that no one has to go it alone, fostering vital human connections through companion care and assistance with everyday tasks. With a growing team of about 500 employees, Papa is not just working to improve lives but is also actively making strides towards greater equality in the workplace by supporting initiatives like the ParityPledge®.\n\n**Services**  \nPapa connects health plans and employers with members and their families to provide compassionate and practical support. Their services include companion care, transportation assistance, help with errands, and more. The emphasis is on maintaining independence for older adults and addressing the unique challenges faced by often marginalized communities. Moreover, for those in need, becoming a \"Papa Pal\" offers both meaningful work and the chance to make a positive difference in the lives of others.\n\n**Impact**  \nThe outcomes speak for themselves: research indicates that Papa members experience improved physical and mental well-being, fewer hospital visits, and greater overall satisfaction. For employers, this innovative care model stands as a unique benefit that enhances employee retention and attracts talent by supporting the family's needs. \n\n**Investors and Growth**  \nPapa's growth is backed by high-profile investors such as Canaan, Tiger Global Management, Comcast Ventures, and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. The company is also a proud member of Y Combinator’s Batch S18, which highlights its potential for substantial impact in the consumer health services sector.\n\n**Culture and Employment**  \nAs an equal opportunity employer, Papa champions diversity at all levels of the organization.
