  "description": "Better Opinions is a prediction market of India which allows users to trade their opinion on everyday topics. For example, If you think India Covid cases will decrease by 10% this week, you can trade this insight and win money if correct.\r\n\nOur aim is to make the app inclusive for all. The stock market unfortunately can be very technical and opaque and therefore isn’t always accessible for all. However, when we start allowing trading in categories such as cricket, politics and entertainment, not only do we make trading more relatable, but we also help improve their financial literacy.",

  "generated_description": "**Better Opinions: A Brief Overview**\n\nBetter Opinions was founded in 2021 and aimed to establish itself as India's innovative prediction market, allowing users to trade on everyday topics. The premise was simple yet engaging: if you believed that COVID-19 cases in India would drop by 10% in a week, you could stake that opinion and potentially earn money if you were right. This approach aimed to democratize trading away from the technical complexities of the stock market and make it more accessible to a broader audience. The platform allowed users to trade in various relatable categories, such as cricket, politics, and entertainment, fostering not just trading but also enhancing financial literacy among users.\n\nLocated in Gurugram, India, the company was part of Y Combinator's W22 batch and had a small team of 12 employees. Its mission was clear: to empower everyone to express and monetize their opinions in a fun and engaging way. With over 150,000 active users and more than 600,000 sign-ups, it seemed to be on a promising trajectory, attracting interest and raising over $1 million in pre-seed funding from notable investors.\n\nHowever, in a significant turn of events, Better Opinions ceased operations on September 30, 2023, due to unspecified business reasons. Despite shutting down, the company reassured users that their ability to withdraw funds from the app would remain unaffected.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n- **Mission:** Prediction market for India, enabling users to trade opinions on various topics.\n- **Founded:** 2021\n- **Location:** Gurugram, India\n- **Team Size:** 12 employees\n- **Users:** 150K+ active users, 600K+ sign-ups\n- **Funding:** Over $1 million raised in pre-seed funding\n- **Current Status:** Ceased operations on September 30, 2023\n\nFor more information and updates, check their website at [betteropinions.in](https://betteropinions.in/)."
