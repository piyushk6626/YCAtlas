  "description": "Zeit Medical leverages the power of AI and wearable sensors to deliver peace of mind for those affected by stroke. Zeit’s smart headband immediately detects the onset of stroke and notifies 911. Each year more than 90% of the one million strokes in the US go untreated, resulting in life-long disability and exploding medical costs north of $100b. The lack of timely treatment is the result of delays in alerting the emergency services. More than 10 million Americans with an elevated stroke risk live with constant fear that a stroke may go unnoticed for hours, while they are asleep or alone. The company was founded by Orestis Vardoulis  PhD  a biomedical & mechanical engineer and expert in digital health (EPFL/Stanford) and Urs Naber  MD  a critical care physician (Dartmouth/Stanford). They have both seen the devastating effects of stroke in their families and came up with the idea of addressing this unmet clinical need during their Stanford Biodesign Innovation Fellowship.",

  "generated_description": "### Zeit Medical: Revolutionizing Stroke Detection\n\n**Mission**: To enable immediate stroke detection at home.\n\nFounded in 2019, Zeit Medical aims to radically transform the way strokes—a condition that affects nearly 1 million Americans annually—are detected and treated, all from the comfort of home. Their smart headband, powered by cutting-edge AI and wearable sensors, constantly monitors the electrical activity of the brain. When it identifies signs of a stroke, it promptly alerts emergency services (911), significantly reducing the delay that often contributes to long-term disabilities and exorbitant medical costs.\n\n#### The Problem at Hand\n\nStrokes are a time-sensitive medical emergency. Unfortunately, over 90% of stroke sufferers in the U.S. go untreated, which inevitably leads to debilitating effects and skyrocketing healthcare expenditures exceeding $100 billion. The underlying issue? A staggering number of individuals—over 10 million Americans at elevated risk—live with anxiety, fearing that if a stroke occurred during the night or while they were alone, it would go unnoticed. Founded by Orestis Vardoulis, PhD (a biomedical and mechanical engineer) and Urs Naber, MD (a critical care physician), both driven by personal experiences of stroke in their families, Zeit Medical was born out of an innovation fellowship at Stanford.\n\n#### Innovative Solution\n\nThe Zeit Medical headband is more than just a piece of wearable technology; it embodies a proactive approach to brain health. It continuously scans for specific patterns in EEG readings that signal a neurological crisis, akin to how an EKG detects arrhythmias. This ability enables swift diagnosis and intervention when needed.\n\nTheir vision extends beyond immediate stroke detection; they aspire to provide comprehensive brain health monitoring across diverse environments.
