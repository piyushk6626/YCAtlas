With a small but dedicated team of nine employees, LifestyleRx has quickly established itself in the telehealth and healthcare sectors as a promising solution for managing and potentially reversing diabetes.\n\n#### Approach to Diabetes Reversal\nAt the core of LifestyleRx's program is a structured, physician-led, fully virtual 12-week course. Patients across British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario can access this program at no cost, fully covered by provincial health plans. The program emphasizes the **4+2 Diabetes Reversal Strategy**, focusing on six key lifestyle changes involving diet, light exercise, sleep, and stress management.

The emphasis on gradual, sustainable changes encourages participants to adopt healthier habits that stick long after the program concludes.\n\n#### Impact and Testimonials\nPatients like Bob, age 73, and Alicia, age 57, have shared their success stories, highlighting dramatic improvements in blood sugar levels and overall health after participating in the program. Feedback emphasizes a wealth of newfound knowledge about diabetes management that many had not encountered in traditional medical settings.\n\n#### Community and Professional Outreach\nBeyond direct patient care, LifestyleRx actively engages with health professionals, providing resources for primary care providers and pharmacists to refer patients into their program. This collaborative approach extends their reach and potentially enhances patient outcomes across the community.\n\n#### Conclusion\nLifestyleRx is paving the way for a new model of care, leveraging technology to provide accessible and effective treatment options for those battling Type 2 Diabetes.
