Lynx is built with enterprise-grade security measures to ensure data protection and operational safety within your environment:\\n\\u200d\\n  * **End-to-End Encryption** : All data transmitted to and from Lynx is protected with end-to-end encryption (AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit), ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information.\\n  * **Data Segmentation and Isolation** : Each customer’s data is logically segmented and isolated within our infrastructure, preventing any unauthorized access across tenants. We never train models with customer data.\\n  * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Single sign-on (SSO) Support** : Lynx supports MFA and integrates with leading SSO providers to ensure secure and streamlined access control.\\n  * **Customer-Controlled Data Retention Policies** : Lynx provides customizable data retention policies so that customers can define how long their data should be stored, aligning with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to our SaaS offering, we offer on-prem and private cloud deployments.To prevent any risk of executing dangerous code, Lynx includes the following safeguards:\\n\\u200d\\n  * **Access Controls and Permissions** : Lynx enforces strict role-based access control (RBAC) so you can define precisely who can trigger certain actions. Engineers can grant specific permissions for investigative tasks while restricting access to sensitive operations or data.\\n  * **Command and Integration Blacklisting** : Lynx allows you to define restricted (blacklisted) commands and integrations that prevent unauthorized or potentially harmful actions from being executed within your environment.\\n  * **Execution Sandboxing** : Lynx can be deployed to isolated execution environments, so access is limited to only necessary system resources and data.\\n  * **Validation and Review Protocols** : Before executing commands, Lynx performs validation checks, including dependency and output verification, to confirm they align with pre-defined parameters. Critical actions require multi-step verification, allowing engineers to review and approve commands before they are run.\\n  * **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring** : Lynx logs all activity and provides real-time monitoring so that any unexpected actions can be identified and reviewed immediately.\\n\\n\\nWith these controls, Lynx operates securely within your environment, empowering teams to resolve issues efficiently while protecting critical systems and data.\\n### **How can I get started?**\\n![Plus icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672dd1aa754059853812a5dd/672dd1aa754059853812a6b5_plus.svg)\\nReach out for a demo to see Lynx in action, or connect with our team to discuss your unique requirements and deployment options.
