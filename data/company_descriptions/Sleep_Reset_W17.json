Why Sleep Reset isa No-Pills Program\\nSleep Reset is a long-term solution that doesn’t rely on harmful sleeping pills.Sleep experts only recommend pills as temporary fixes, which can lead to dependency.Many sleep aids only sedate you, preventing you from reaching critical deep brain wave REM sleep – causing daytime grogginess, long-term health risks like Alzheimer’s or dementia, and potentially even increased mortality.That’s why both the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the American College of Physicians recommend our program’s techniques over pills.\\n[Take our sleep

would take me 2 hrs to get going in the mornings from my cocktail of OTC sleep products (1 Benadryl, 5-10 mg of Melatonin)- that weren’t even working. It took 15 days for me to see a change and it got worse before it got better, but I’m really happy with where I am now. I’m down to 1/2 Benadryl only and am weaning off that. Even if I wake up at night (by my husband, bathroom, etc.) I go right back to sleep. I have gained 3-5 hrs in my day and can participate in some early group workouts.\\nJo M\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI started having insomnia several years ago due to work-related stress. The stress resolved but by that time my body had become habituated to waking during the night for several hours. I’ve tried lots of different things, including exercise and melatonin, to help but realized I needed a structured program. You have a sleep coach assigned to you and can ask questions anytime and the coach will answer the next work day. If the coach doesn’t hear from you, he or she will check in every week. I liked the information presented, logging my sleep and having the coach for accountability. I’m happy to say that I feel like I have graduated and no longer need this program because it solved my sleep issue. Thank you so much to the makers of this program. It was life changing for me!\\nMary L\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI was at rock bottom and exhausted, sleeping 2 - 3 hours a night. I went to my doctor and they gave me sleeping pills. They helped a little, but I experienced side effects in the morning. I tried expensive patches and drugs from the internet. Nothing worked. Through a series of desperate “I’ll try anything,” I found this program. I now sleep six-plus hours a night on average. I understand why I wasn't sleeping and how to change my habits to get better sleep. The best part is no sleeping pills, patches, or drinks. I was very skeptical but desperate, so I tried it, and my life will forever be better.\\nCatherine Z\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI have been struggling with sleep issues for over 20 years and this program has been a game changer! While my sleep is not perfect, I am sleeping longer and better without the long nocturnal waking periods I’ve had in the past. Among the many lessons I have benefited from are Mindfulness, Meditation, Self-Compassion, Patience, Deep Breathing, Body Scanning — the list goes on. Many of the techniques presented are familiar, but it was so very helpful to have the information and guidance presented in the lessons and then to practice. My coach was great - available each weekday, helpful, supportive, encouraging. I highly recommend this program. It is backed by sound scientific studies. I didn’t want to go the sleep study route, and this totally answered my needs and concerns.\\nNathan O\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nThis process works. I had been taking a variety of OTC sleep aids with varying degrees of success. I had read about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and this program had quite good reviews from people who had completed the program. I’m in my 3rd week now and am sleeping through the night. I do realize that that phrase usually applies to 3 month old infants. Still, it’s true. My coach is available every day and offers helpful tips and advice. I’ve needed help in quieting my active mind and developing a good wind down routine. Since I’m sleeping through the night now, these strategies work.\\nDoug R\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI was taking sleeping pills every night because sleep was such a difficult thing for me. I was getting desperate with sleep. I cannot believe I paid for this, but I am so glad I did. Sounds weird, but I learned how to sleep. My coach was great and I kicked the pills ASAP. The method worked and within a few days I was falling asleep in minutes. Not every night is perfect, but I know what to do when I cannot sleep now. I already had good sleep habits, but improved them and found deeper knowledge. Getting my mom to try this soon.\\nJason P\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI relied on sleep meds for over a decade and had stopped believing that I could sleep naturally. After a bad experience with a drug called temazepam, a doctor recommended that I try cognitive behavioral therapy for sleep. After a quick search, I found Sleep Reset. The process takes work— it’s not a magic pill. I stuck with the program and learned a new set of skills that have helped me so much. My coach has been wonderful and supportive throughout (and yes, you have a real person to help along the way). The most important thing is that I feel like I understand my sleep experience better and I have tools to reach for when I do need help. I highly recommend the program and hope more people like me learn to live without aids that only leave you groggy. It’s possible!\\nJessie H\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI signed up for this program out of desperation for my insomnia that has plagued me for decades. It was incredibly easy to use, with so many useful resources neatly packaged. I’ve used over the counter supplements, herbal supplements, and doctor prescribed medication. I’ve also tried meditation, qigong, and yoga on my own. This program has a totally different approach - it is so much an educational experience as well as a support system. It incorporated what I already knew and brought it to a new level of awareness. My sleep coach was always so supportive. I expected her to tell me what to do, but she also challenged me to help myself by asking direct questions that let me self reflect. I’ve never tried a sleep program nor a sleep coach. Getting back to deep restorative sleep is not an overnight miracle. If you are willing to be patient with yourself and open to improving your overall well-being, this program will help you. So many other areas of my personal care improved, as a bonus! This is a super star program!\\nChase T.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nMy doctor has been suggesting I do a “sleep study” for insomnia for almost a year, but I never wanted to because it sounded like a huge hassle. I pictured myself filling out a lot of paperwork or staying overnight at a lab. I’m pretty sure this program is the equivalent of a sleep study at a fraction of the cost and inconvenience. In just 10 days I went from having long term, severe insomnia (0-3 hours of sleep a night) to 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep last night. I feel so much better. I am confident that if I continue the program I will improve my sleep even more, and I will solidify the habits that I’m learning from the program and make them lifelong habits. I honestly had no idea how poor my sleep habits were. I would definitely recommend giving this program a try, so long as you are really ready to do what it says.\\nLima L\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI have been prescribed Xanax, sleeping pills, marijuana etc. for my chronic sleep problems. This program, in conjunction with one on one therapy, has kept me insomnia free for 3 months. WORTH EVERY PENNY AND FOLLOW IT TO A T! You will feel results that are long lasting.

Why Sleep Reset isa No-Pills Program\\nSleep Reset is a long-term solution that doesn’t rely on harmful sleeping pills.Sleep experts only recommend pills as temporary fixes, which can lead to dependency.Many sleep aids only sedate you, preventing you from reaching critical deep brain wave REM sleep – causing daytime grogginess, long-term health risks like Alzheimer’s or dementia, and potentially even increased mortality.That’s why both the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the American College of Physicians recommend our program’s techniques over pills.\\nTake our sleep

would take me 2 hrs to get going in the mornings from my cocktail of OTC sleep products (1 Benadryl, 5-10 mg of Melatonin)- that weren’t even working. It took 15 days for me to see a change and it got worse before it got better, but I’m really happy with where I am now. I’m down to 1/2 Benadryl only and am weaning off that. Even if I wake up at night (by my husband, bathroom, etc.) I go right back to sleep. I have gained 3-5 hrs in my day and can participate in some early group workouts.\\nJo M\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI started having insomnia several years ago due to work-related stress. The stress resolved but by that time my body had become habituated to waking during the night for several hours. I’ve tried lots of different things, including exercise and melatonin, to help but realized I needed a structured program. You have a sleep coach assigned to you and can ask questions anytime and the coach will answer the next work day. If the coach doesn’t hear from you, he or she will check in every week. I liked the information presented, logging my sleep and having the coach for accountability. I’m happy to say that I feel like I have graduated and no longer need this program because it solved my sleep issue. Thank you so much to the makers of this program. It was life changing for me!\\nMary L\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI was at rock bottom and exhausted, sleeping 2 - 3 hours a night. I went to my doctor and they gave me sleeping pills. They helped a little, but I experienced side effects in the morning. I tried expensive patches and drugs from the internet. Nothing worked. Through a series of desperate “I’ll try anything,” I found this program. I now sleep six-plus hours a night on average. I understand why I wasn't sleeping and how to change my habits to get better sleep. The best part is no sleeping pills, patches, or drinks. I was very skeptical but desperate, so I tried it, and my life will forever be better.\\nCatherine Z\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI have been struggling with sleep issues for over 20 years and this program has been a game changer! While my sleep is not perfect, I am sleeping longer and better without the long nocturnal waking periods I’ve had in the past. Among the many lessons I have benefited from are Mindfulness, Meditation, Self-Compassion, Patience, Deep Breathing, Body Scanning — the list goes on. Many of the techniques presented are familiar, but it was so very helpful to have the information and guidance presented in the lessons and then to practice. My coach was great - available each weekday, helpful, supportive, encouraging. I highly recommend this program. It is backed by sound scientific studies. I didn’t want to go the sleep study route, and this totally answered my needs and concerns.\\nNathan O\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nThis process works. I had been taking a variety of OTC sleep aids with varying degrees of success. I had read about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and this program had quite good reviews from people who had completed the program. I’m in my 3rd week now and am sleeping through the night. I do realize that that phrase usually applies to 3 month old infants. Still, it’s true. My coach is available every day and offers helpful tips and advice. I’ve needed help in quieting my active mind and developing a good wind down routine. Since I’m sleeping through the night now, these strategies work.\\nDoug R\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI was taking sleeping pills every night because sleep was such a difficult thing for me. I was getting desperate with sleep. I cannot believe I paid for this, but I am so glad I did. Sounds weird, but I learned how to sleep. My coach was great and I kicked the pills ASAP. The method worked and within a few days I was falling asleep in minutes. Not every night is perfect, but I know what to do when I cannot sleep now. I already had good sleep habits, but improved them and found deeper knowledge. Getting my mom to try this soon.\\nJason P\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI relied on sleep meds for over a decade and had stopped believing that I could sleep naturally. After a bad experience with a drug called temazepam, a doctor recommended that I try cognitive behavioral therapy for sleep. After a quick search, I found Sleep Reset. The process takes work— it’s not a magic pill. I stuck with the program and learned a new set of skills that have helped me so much. My coach has been wonderful and supportive throughout (and yes, you have a real person to help along the way). The most important thing is that I feel like I understand my sleep experience better and I have tools to reach for when I do need help. I highly recommend the program and hope more people like me learn to live without aids that only leave you groggy. It’s possible!\\nJessie H\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI signed up for this program out of desperation for my insomnia that has plagued me for decades. It was incredibly easy to use, with so many useful resources neatly packaged. I’ve used over the counter supplements, herbal supplements, and doctor prescribed medication. I’ve also tried meditation, qigong, and yoga on my own. This program has a totally different approach - it is so much an educational experience as well as a support system. It incorporated what I already knew and brought it to a new level of awareness. My sleep coach was always so supportive. I expected her to tell me what to do, but she also challenged me to help myself by asking direct questions that let me self reflect. I’ve never tried a sleep program nor a sleep coach. Getting back to deep restorative sleep is not an overnight miracle. If you are willing to be patient with yourself and open to improving your overall well-being, this program will help you. So many other areas of my personal care improved, as a bonus! This is a super star program!\\nChase T.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nMy doctor has been suggesting I do a “sleep study” for insomnia for almost a year, but I never wanted to because it sounded like a huge hassle. I pictured myself filling out a lot of paperwork or staying overnight at a lab. I’m pretty sure this program is the equivalent of a sleep study at a fraction of the cost and inconvenience. In just 10 days I went from having long term, severe insomnia (0-3 hours of sleep a night) to 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep last night. I feel so much better. I am confident that if I continue the program I will improve my sleep even more, and I will solidify the habits that I’m learning from the program and make them lifelong habits. I honestly had no idea how poor my sleep habits were. I would definitely recommend giving this program a try, so long as you are really ready to do what it says.\\nLima L\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/6483402f3d5c25f54cd9b4bc_Frame%201133.svg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e6c90d43582777cf0fc084/64833ff50244efd7c85497bb_Text.svg)\\nI have been prescribed Xanax, sleeping pills, marijuana etc. for my chronic sleep problems.
