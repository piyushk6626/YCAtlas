With Pulley, you can compare different funding scenarios, raise capital, and set up equity grants for employees.\r\n\nOur tools help companies answer important questions such as:\r\n1. How much of the company will I own after my next round?\r\n2. How will pro-rata rights impact my ownership in future rounds?\r\n3. How do I explain the value of equity to candidates?\r\n\nEquity is a company's single most important asset. Pulley gives companies insights into their equity, so they can make smarter decisions around hiring and fundraising, while proactively staying ahead of tax filings and accounting. If you are looking for a way to manage your cap table, try Pulley at https://pulley.com/.",
