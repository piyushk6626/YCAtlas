  "description": "Altay develops small molecule drugs to treat chronic liver diseases like liver fibrosis and liver cancer.  Our co-founder Dr. Osman Ozes, led the first drug development program for Esbriet (Pirfenidone), resulting in the first FDA approved therapy for lung fibrosis. Esbriet is now a $1 billion/year drug and has already made over $6 billion in revenue. \r\n\nWith a team that has over 70+ years of small molecule drug development experience, we intend to do the same with chronic liver diseases, which affects over 20 million Americans and represents a market size of over $30 billion. \r\n\nWe know we are well positioned for success because we have shown excellent pre-clinical mouse data in several liver fibrosis models using our novel small molecule. We demonstrate a reduction in fibrosis with our drug, but more significantly, we show a reversal in fibrotic tissue back to normal tissue. \r\n\nWith our current developmental strategy, we hope to have a clinic-ready compound by the end of 2021 and be in phase I clinical trials by mid of 2022.",

  "generated_description": "**Altay Therapeutics: Pioneering Disease-Modifying Therapies for Liver Diseases**\n\nFounded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator's W20 batch, Altay Therapeutics is a biotech company located in San Carlos, California. With a lean team of six, Altay focuses on developing disease-modifying therapies specifically targeting chronic liver diseases like liver fibrosis and cancer. The founding team boasts over 70 years of collective experience in small molecule drug development, including key contributions to Esbriet (Pirfenidone), the first FDA-approved treatment for lung fibrosis, which has generated over $6 billion in revenue.\n\nAltay's mission is ambitious yet straightforward: to revolutionize treatment options for chronic liver diseases, which affect more than 20 million Americans and represent a multi-billion-dollar market. Their innovative approach involves leveraging promising pre-clinical mouse data that demonstrates their drug's ability not just to reduce fibrosis but to reverse it back to normal tissue.\n\nThe company is targeting to have a clinic-ready compound by the end of 2021, aiming to commence Phase I clinical trials by mid-2022. This timeline suggests a fast-paced development strategy indicative of their focused vision.\n\nTheir efforts are centered on AI-powered drug discovery—a rapidly evolving field that could enhance the precision of developing new therapeutics. Altay's work represents a blend of advanced science and genuine compassion for patients facing debilitating liver conditions. \n\nBy staying ahead of the curve and aiming for quick transitions from lab bench to clinical application, Altay Therapeutics is positioning itself as a potential leader in the biotech space.\n\nFor more details and insights into their technology and pipeline, visit their website: [Altay Therapeutics](http://www.altaytherapeutics.com)."
