  "description": "Ovipost builds automated insect farms. Insects are the most efficient way to convert abundant, cheap byproducts into nutritionally dense protein. Today live insects are a $175m industry in the US, but the future of the industry is leveraging their excellent amino acid profiles and superior digestibility to replace fishmeal ($9.5B industry) and other expensive proteins in animal feeds. Led by co-founders Trina Chiasson (sold Infoactive to Tableau) and Teq Sassmannshaus (biotech hardware engineer), the Ovipost team has deep experience in hardware, software, and biology.",

  "generated_description": "**Ovipost: Revolutionizing Insect Farming**\n\nOvipost is on a mission to transform the insect farming industry through automation. Founded by entrepreneurs Trina Chiasson, who previously sold Infoactive to Tableau, and Teq Sassmannshaus, a seasoned biotech hardware engineer, Ovipost combines expertise in hardware, software, and biology to build automated insect farms. \n\nThe rationale is straightforward: insects are incredible converters of abundant and inexpensive byproducts into high-quality protein. In the U.S., live insects represent a $175 million industry, but the bigger opportunity lies in replacing fishmeal—a $9.5 billion market— and other costly protein sources in animal feed using insects’ excellent amino acid profiles and superior digestibility.\n\nFounded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator's Batch W18, Ovipost operates out of LaBelle, Florida, with a dedicated team of 20 employees. Their commitment to sustainable practices positions them well within the tags of biotech, climate tech, food tech, and agriculture.\n\nThe company produces a variety of live insects, including crickets, mealworms, superworms, roaches, and black soldier fly larvae, all cultivated in clean, controlled environments to ensure quality and safety. They emphasize that their insects are raised on premium, chemical-free diets, making them a reliable food source for pets like reptiles, birds, and amphibians.\n\nOvipost also prides itself on their customer service and satisfaction. With guaranteed live delivery and glowing testimonials, they have established a reputation for excellence in this niche market. \n\nWhether you’re a pet owner looking to provide the best nutrition for your animals or a company searching for sustainable protein alternatives in animal feed, Ovipost stands at the forefront of insect farming innovation. \n\nFor more information, you can visit their website at [Ovipost.com](https://ovipost.com)."
