  "generated_description": "**Stellar Sleep: Your Partner in Overcoming Insomnia**\n\nFounded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S23, Stellar Sleep is revolutionizing how we approach chronic insomnia—an issue that plagues 25 million Americans with often overlooked psychological roots. The company's mission is straightforward: to help people conquer insomnia through tailored psychological strategies rather than superficial remedies like cutting coffee or resorting to meditation.\n\n### The Problem\n\nChronic insomnia is more than just a sleep issue; it’s a complex challenge that frequently stems from deeper psychological problems such as anxiety and stress. Many traditional treatments miss this mark, leaving sufferers with barely scratched surfaces. This is exactly why Stellar Sleep exists—to address these root causes head-on.\n\n### How It Works\n\nTheir approach is clear and effective. Users begin by taking a free online sleep quiz designed to assess their unique sleep patterns and life factors. Based on the results, Stellar Sleep then crafts a personalized program rooted in proven behavioral therapy techniques. \n\nHere’s the gist:\n1. **Online Sleep Quiz**: Understand your sleep state.\n2. **Personalized Program**: Get a bespoke plan focused on psychological solutions.\n3. **Long-lasting Results**: Cultivate skills that lead to sustainable sleep improvements rather than quick fixes.\n\n### The Science Behind Stellar Sleep\n\nStellar Sleep isn’t just throwing random tips at you. Their strategies utilize evidence-based techniques from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). These methods address various aspects of insomnia, employing techniques like Sleep Restriction Therapy, Cognitive Restructuring, and more. \n\n### Not Just Another App\n\nThis isn’t just any sleep app. Stellar Sleep has been recognized with multiple awards, including the first place in the 2022 Digital Health Innovation Awards for Best Overall SleepTech Solution.
