Maybe you think it will never go away. It's frustrating because it distracts you from work, your daily life, the little things, doing the activities and sports you love. You put it off. The more you put it off, the longer it persists. Maybe you have given up on it. The good news is you don't have to live in pain. See what's possible for you and your health today. Get freedom from your pain, so you don't have that nagging annoyance stopping you from your busy life. \\n[Check Availability](https://www.shasta.health/</requestAppointment>)\\n![hiking](https://www.shasta.health/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fjoel-jasmin-forestbird-znoL1m6MD_k-unsplash.14f36ffb.jpg&w=1920&q=75)\\n[](https://www.shasta.health/</>)\\n[](https://www.shasta.health/<https:/www.instagram.com/getshastahealth/>)[](https://www.shasta.health/<https:/www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100094633298590>)[](https://www.shasta.health/<https:/twitter.com/getshastahealth>)\\n![HIPAA Compliant](https://www.shasta.health/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FHIPAA-Compliant-Logo.0b7f7e2b.png&w=1080&q=75)\\n###### Cities\\n  * [San Francisco](https://www.shasta.health/</local-physical-therapists/san-francisco>)\\n  * [San Jose](https://www.shasta.health/</local-physical-therapists/san-jose>)\\n  * [Los Angeles](https://www.shasta.health/</local-physical-therapists/los-angeles>)\\n  * [Sacramento](https://www.shasta.health/</local-physical-therapists/sacramento>)\\n  * [Brooklyn](https://www.shasta.health/</local-physical-therapists/brooklyn>)\\n  * [New York](https://www.shasta.health/</local-physical-therapists/new-york>)\\n\\n\\n###### Site Links\\n  * [Home](https://www.shasta.health/</>)\\n  * [Our Story](https://www.shasta.health/</about>)\\n  * [Blog](https://www.shasta.health/</blog>)\\n  * [Sign In](https://www.shasta.health/<https:/beta.shasta.health/signin>)\\n  * [Terms & Conditions](https://www.shasta.health/</terms>)\\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.shasta.health/</privacy-policy>)\\n\\n\\n###### Contact us\\n  * ##### Email\\nconcierge@shasta.health\\n  * ##### Phone\\n(833) 270-9820\\n\\n\\n© 2025 Shasta Health Inc.
