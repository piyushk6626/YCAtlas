Our machines sit on-prem at customer sites, growing cells which they use for testing during early-stage drug development.\r\n\nEven though testing on cells is so critical for developing new drugs, today they're all grown totally manually, the same as 100 years ago! With our machines, for the first time our customers can hands-off manipulate and monitor batches of cells from the cloud.\r\n\nWe've already working with some of the biggest pharma companies. Mytos has the opportunity to change the way the entire industry works - join us and help us get there!",

  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Mytos**\n\nMytos is on a mission to revolutionize a core yet often neglected aspect of biotechnology: the process of growing human cells. Despite being crucial for drug development, cell cultivation has remained stubbornly manual, reflecting practices from a century ago. Mytos aims to change that by offering cloud-connected machines that automate this process, allowing biotech and pharmaceutical companies to grow cells with unprecedented ease and efficiency.\n\n**The Technology**\n\nFounded as part of Y Combinator’s S18 batch, Mytos has developed an innovative platform designed for fully automated cell manufacturing. Their machines are installed on-premises at customer sites, enabling real-time monitoring and manipulation through the cloud. This automation not only streamlines workflow but also significantly enhances scalability, quality, and productivity. With just one technician operating their system, the output can rival that of ten scientists working manually—no more contamination or lost batches due to error.\n\n**Market Impact**\n\nMytos is making strides in the industry, already working with some of the top pharmaceutical companies. By transforming cell culture from a manual, artisanal process into a highly automated system, they are poised to change the landscape of drug development entirely.\n\n**The Team and Location**\n\nBased in London, UK, Mytos has assembled a skilled team of 26 individuals, including hardware and software engineers as well as biologists, all focused on innovating and building the essential infrastructure for modern biotech.\n\n**Get Involved**\n\nMytos invites those interested in the future of biotechnology to join them on this impactful journey. With the industry's shift towards automation, they are not just improving cell growth; they are paving the way for faster and more effective drug development.\n\nFor more information, check out their website at [Mytos](https://www.mytos.bio)."
