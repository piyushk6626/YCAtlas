Our flagship product is the AtoB Fuel Card, a zero-fee fuel card accepted anywhere built for fleets of all shapes and sizes.",

These challenges involved managing invoices, card malfunctions, and slow customer support. To boost efficiency, Stotland Trucking switched to AtoB, gaining benefits such as streamlined reporting, convenient fuel fleet card activation/deactivation, round-the-clock support, and a 10% fuel cost reduction after switching to AtoB.\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62c496dceca674e60a6d1ecd/654011cbc132f702fb683411_stotland.png)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62c496dceca674e60a6d1ecd/64b53aee7cabeaaa12e39f81_stotland.png)\\n# 80\\nfleet size\\n# 10%\\nreduction in total fuel costs after switching to AtoB\\n# $3K\\nSaved per driver, each year on fuel fraud and through AtoB\\'s Discount Network\\n# 6\\nhours saved per week on finance management with the AtoB Dashboard\\n# Other ways AtoB can help you save\\n### Fuel at the lowest price\\nWith FuelMap, you’ll no longer have to check fuel prices while on the road.

Thanks to AtoB’s Telematics integration, SMS Unlock, and the ability to proactively decline suspicious transactions, we’ve been able to finally ensure the spend on our cards are only at approved merchants and on approved transactions. Due to AtoB’s SMS unlock and telematics integration features, we believe fuel card misuse has now gone to zero.\\n**Oliver Hahn** , Head of Business Operations, Kyte\\nSwitching to AtoB was a breeze. We were able to easily onboard all of our 80 employees on the driver app and start using AtoB’s discount network to claim big discounts on fuel. Our customer success rep is always there when we need him and extremely responsive.\\n**Paul Stefano,** GM of Dan King Plumbing Heating and Air Conditioning\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62c496dceca674e60a6d1ecd/6414e4dc6c809281d1d04d72_derrick.jpg)\\nWe used both Fuelman and Comdata cards. They were confusing, it was hard to work with the invoices, cards would randomly shut down, and it would take hours just to speak to someone who rarely would be able to solve our issues. Switching to AtoB Unlimited has been a night and day difference. It’s like AtoB listened!\\n**Derrick Stotland** , CEO, Stotland Trucking\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62c496dceca674e60a6d1ecd/6414e453016793eef9a51678_Matt.jpeg)\\nWith AtoB I have peace of mind. I’m not worried about possible fuel theft any more, which was a major issue over the past years because it’s virtually impossible to steal with AtoB. Your [AtoB’s] telematics integration and card unlock features make security easy and effective.

Our trucking fuel cards are trusted by fleets big and small, including those in supply chain logistics, public services, education, construction, delivery fleets, and trucking. Whether you manage a large fleet or a small business, our fleet fuel cards offer comprehensive support for all your fuel purchases, helping you streamline operations and achieve significant savings.\\n[**What is the difference between a trucking fuel card and a business gas credit card?**](https://atob.com/<#>)\\nA trucking fuel card, often referred to as a fleet card, and a business gas credit card both help manage fuel expenses, but they offer different features. A fuel card is specifically designed for fleet management, providing detailed reporting on fuel transactions, enabling purchase controls, and offering discounts on fuel purchases. A business gas credit card, while also useful, may not offer the same level of control or savings specifically tailored to fleet needs. AtoB has the best fuel card engineered to provide maximum savings and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for fleet managers looking to optimize their fuel spend.\\n[**What support does AtoB provide for its services?**](https://atob.com/<#>)\\nAtoB provides robust support for all its services, ensuring that fleet managers can manage their operations smoothly.

Our user-friendly dashboard allows you to assign cards, set spending limits, and monitor fuel consumption efficiently. Additionally, we provide seamless integration with more than 23 telematics systems, including Samsara, Geotab, Omnitracs, and more, to enhance your [fleet management](https://atob.com/</blog/what-is-fleet-management>) capabilities.\\n[**How does AtoB\\'s telematics integration work?**](https://atob.com/<#>)\\nAtoB\\'s [telematics integration](https://atob.com/</blog/what-is-telematics>) is designed to provide comprehensive control over your fleet\\'s fuel expenses.

This integration helps prevent unauthorized fuel use by ensuring that fuel purchases match the vehicle\\'s tank capacity and location. It also allows for detailed monitoring of fuel consumption, helping fleet managers identify opportunities for further savings and efficiency improvements.\\u200dExplore how AtoB\\'s fleet cards can revolutionize your fleet management with tailored solutions, extensive support, and significant savings.

They also enable fleet managers to impose limits and oversee fuel expenses, making it easier to pick the right fuel card based on fleet size and operational needs.\\n[**How can fleet managers set purchase controls with trucking fuel cards?**](https://atob.com/<#>)\\nFleet managers can establish fuel purchase controls using AtoB\\'s trucking fuel cards.

Additionally, these controls play a crucial role in preventing [fuel fraud](https://atob.com/</blog/how-to-prevent-fuel-card-fraud>), a common issue in the trucking industry. By setting limits on purchase amounts and monitoring real-time transactions, fleet managers can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized or fraudulent fuel purchases, leading to substantial fuel savings and improved overall fuel management.\\n[](https://atob.com/</get-started>)\\n# Let\\'s get you up and running with AtoB\\n[Get startedGet started](https://atob.com/<#>)\\nThank you!

A fuel card is specifically designed for fleet management, providing detailed reporting on fuel transactions, enabling purchase controls, and offering discounts on fuel purchases. A business gas credit card, while also useful, may not offer the same level of control or savings specifically tailored to fleet needs. AtoB has the best fuel card engineered to provide maximum savings and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for fleet managers looking to optimize their fuel spend.\\n**What support does AtoB provide for its services?**⟨15⟩\\nAtoB provides robust support for all its services, ensuring that fleet managers can manage their operations smoothly. We offer 24/7 customer support with quick response times to address any issues promptly. Our user-friendly dashboard allows you to assign cards, set spending limits, and monitor fuel consumption efficiently. Additionally, we provide seamless integration with more than 23 telematics systems, including Samsara, Geotab, Omnitracs, and more, to enhance your fleet management⟨56⟩ capabilities.\\n**How does AtoB\\'s telematics integration work?**⟨15⟩\\nAtoB\\'s telematics integration⟨57⟩ is designed to provide comprehensive control over your fleet\\'s fuel expenses.

This integration helps prevent unauthorized fuel use by ensuring that fuel purchases match the vehicle\\'s tank capacity and location. It also allows for detailed monitoring of fuel consumption, helping fleet managers identify opportunities for further savings and efficiency improvements.\\u200dExplore how AtoB\\'s fleet cards can revolutionize your fleet management with tailored solutions, extensive support, and significant savings.

It offers reporting tools that track fuel expenses, allowing fleet managers to optimize costs for large fleets.\\n**What are the benefits of using fleet fuel cards for large fleets?**⟨15⟩\\nFleet fuel cards provide significant savings on diesel and real-time tracking of fuel usage. They also enable fleet managers to impose limits and oversee fuel expenses, making it easier to pick the right fuel card based on fleet size and operational needs.\\n**How can fleet managers set purchase controls with trucking fuel cards?**⟨15⟩\\nFleet managers can establish fuel purchase controls using AtoB\\'s trucking fuel cards. This ensures that only authorized personnel can make transactions and that those purchases stay within the fleet’s fuel cost budget. Additionally, these controls play a crucial role in preventing fuel fraud⟨58⟩, a common issue in the trucking industry. By setting limits on purchase amounts and monitoring real-time transactions, fleet managers can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized or fraudulent fuel purchases, leading to substantial fuel savings and improved overall fuel management.\\n[](https://atob.com/</get-started>)\\n# Let\\'s get you up and running with AtoB\\nGet startedGet started⟨15⟩\\nThank you!

Think about it—trucking is essential to our economy, yet those managing these operations are stuck with outdated and cumbersome payment tools riddled with hidden fees and fraught with security risks. \n\nEnter AtoB, which positions itself as the **\"Stripe for Transportation.\"** Their mission? To modernize the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics, allowing for faster and more transparent capital movement. At the heart of their offerings is the **AtoB Fuel Card**, a zero-fee fuel card crafted for fleets of all shapes and sizes. It’s not just a card; it promises competitive discounts on fuel and robust security features, ensuring fleet operators keep more of their hard-earned cash.\n\nLocated in San Francisco, AtoB boasts a team of 71 talented individuals, with Michael Seibel, a noted entrepreneur and investor, as their Group Partner. The company has successfully positioned itself in the fintech sphere, particularly within the payments and SaaS landscape, and its innovations specifically target the supply chain and transportation sectors.\n\n#### Key Offerings\n- **AtoB Fuel Card**: Designed for efficiency, cost savings, and security for truck fleets.\n- **Driver Pay**: Allows businesses to pay drivers instantaneously and with lower fees.\n- **Discount Networks**: Partnerships with gas stations and truck stops lead to substantial savings, averaging **45 cents** per gallon for truck diesel, with peak discounts hitting **up to $2.00**.\n\n#### Who They Serve\nAtoB caters to a diverse customer base:\n- **Local Businesses**: Supporting regional and short-journey fleets.\n- **Over the Road Fleets**: Catering to operations with nationwide reach.\n\nThe company highlights a commitment to helping a variety of industries including public services, construction, education, and delivery.\n\nAtoB’s user-friendly dashboard offers real-time transaction monitoring, preventative measures against fuel fraud (including telematics integration), and customizable controls—all streamlined for fleet managers who need clarity and control over their expenditures.\n\n#### Why It Matters\nThis isn’t just about making transactions easier; it’s about empowering an industry that is vital to every supply chain. By removing the hurdles associated with traditional payment methods, AtoB is not only improving profitability for fleet owners but also injecting a much-needed shot of innovation into transportation payments.\n\nTo explore more about AtoB and see how they can redefine payment solutions for your fleet, check their [website](https://atob.com/)."
