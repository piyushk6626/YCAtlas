  "generated_description": "**Waterplan Overview:**\n\nFounded in 2021 and based in San Francisco, Waterplan is at the forefront of water risk management for industrial sites. The company addresses one of the most pressing challenges of our time—how to mitigate water risk as climate change continues to affect water availability across the globe. As a participant in Y Combinator's Batch S21, Waterplan has quickly established itself as a leader in this niche. \n\n**Mission and Services:**\n\nWaterplan's mission revolves around providing organizations with the tools they need to measure, respond to, and report water risks. Its platform harnesses advanced AI to combine operational data from companies with real-time water satellite imagery. This powerful data combination offers clients—ranging from Coca-Cola to Diageo—a thorough, constantly updated view of their water risk, allowing for informed decision-making.\n\nThe service portfolio is robust and focuses on three core areas:\n1. **Measure**: Delivering high-quality, site-specific water risk data that helps businesses understand their localized water challenges.\n2. **Report**: Streamlining water reporting processes to align with major disclosure frameworks like ESRS, CDP, and GRI, ensuring compliance while saving time.\n3. **Respond**: Identifying and tracking risk mitigation opportunities. This includes guiding companies in adapting to their water-related commitments through both infrastructure and nature-based solutions.\n\n**Team and Expertise:**\n\nWaterplan’s team comprises seasoned tech and water entrepreneurs, many of whom have previous successes in the water sector and are dedicated to helping companies navigate their sustainability journeys. The company employs around 30 people, and their expertise is complemented by early support from high-profile investors including Y Combinator, Richard Branson's family, and actor Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Granular Data Availability**: Unlike traditional data sources that can be broad and generalized, Waterplan provides detailed, localized water risk data, enabling companies to avoid the pitfalls of relying on inaccurate information.\n- **Automated Reporting**: The platform simplifies the complex landscape of water reporting, allowing clients to focus on taking action against water risks rather than getting lost in data collection.\n- **Collaboration and Support**: By facilitating collaboration between companies and local water initiatives, Waterplan ensures continuous improvement toward sustainability goals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn essence, Waterplan stands out as a crucial partner for any organization looking to secure its future in a world where water risk is increasingly difficult to predict and manage. Their thoughtful application of technology and expert insights empowers companies to not only mitigate risk but also actively engage in corporate sustainability efforts. Want to know more?
