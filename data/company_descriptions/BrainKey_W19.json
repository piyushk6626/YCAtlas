But it was missed, and her outcome is worse for it. \\nWe created BrainKey to create a powerful new tool that can fundamentally improve how we identify, treat, and manage brain health. It’s a personal mission for me, but it’s a global problem as 1 in 3 will experience dementia in their lifetime.” \\n-Owen Philips, PhD \\nCEO and Founder of BrainKey \\n## BrainKey Stories\\n“ \\nIn the past year, my mom had multiple brain scans in one hospital. Whenever I wanted to go and talk to a different doctor about her care at a different hospital, they needed the scans. I had to go back to the hospital, get a new CD, and send it via mail to the other doctor. BrainKey solves this problem. I have her data stored online and when I see a new doctor, it’s right there at my fingertips.\\nLuisa, Zurich, Switzerland \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nI have a unique brain and ever since my brain surgery, I have been fascinated to learn more about it. The problem with CT-scans and MRI scans is that they only show 2 dimensions. I would highly recommend BrainKey to anyone interested in their brain and seeing it in 3D! I believe their technology is amazing.\\nJonathan, Cleveland \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nI have always been intrigued about seeing my own brain. Being given the opportunity to voluntarily check in on my brain health is so unique. My scanning experience was extremely safe, especially during COVID-19, I felt very comfortable. It was so interesting to see the health insights provided by BrainKey. I especially liked zooming in on different parts of my brain and exploring them.\\nAmelia, Los Angeles \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nWithout any symptoms that might lead a doctor to refer me to get a brain MRI, I felt like BrainKey offered something that I couldn’t get elsewhere. The process of the scan itself was seamless; the imaging center employees were very helpful in making the process comfortable and safe. It was exciting to get the email from BrainKey following the scan and gain access to my brain on my computer at home, like I’ve never been able to before. \\nWill, San Francisco \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nLaying eyes on your own brain for the first time is kind of a surreal experience. Brain imaging software used to be reserved for medical professionals only. But BrainKey has managed to provide a simple and intuitive interface to interact with your own brain so that anyone can easily travel through all of the nooks and crannies of their own brain. The data they provide allows you to get to know your brain better than ever before and even learn a thing or two about the brain regions while doing so.\\nÖmer, Amsterdam \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nFast service with reasonable price. I would like to do this annually. Cannot believe we track height/weight/eye... monthly and annually. But not the most important organ, the brain.\\nY.

I love to see the structure of my own brain and the possibility of tracking changes over time.\\nKierstin, New Jersey \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nSeeing and exploring my own brain in Brainkey is awesome! It inspired me to read up on the structure of the brain, which led me to research more health topics and now I have the benefit and satisfaction of a greater understanding of the body. BrainKey's automatic region segmentation is especially cool, and way beyond anything I've seen in other software.\\nDoug, San Francisco \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nBrainkey made it easy for someone with no imaging experience to approach to understand what I am looking at. Amazing and easy-to-use technology, definitely worth doing.\\nJonathan, Chicago \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nWhen I first tried BrainKey, I was really excited to see my brain in 3D.

BrainKey is really helping me to learn about my MRI brain scans.\\nNicole, Idaho \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nIt was amazing to interact with my brain and get a full report of my brain health. The visualization is like nothing I’ve seen before with a very easy-to-use interface. Overall, BrainKey greatly helped form my own understanding of my brain health as I approach an age where I could be potentially more vulnerable to neurodegenerative diseases.\\nRen, Los Angeles \\nBrainKey user since 2020 \\n“ \\nI am excited to get a BrainKey Scan to open this ‘black box’ of my head and gain deeper self-understanding and actionable recommendations.

As part of Y Combinator's W19 batch, this nimble, twelve-person team is making strides in the intersection of neurotechnology and digital health.\n\nAt its core, BrainKey focuses on quantifying brain health. They analyze brain MRI scans and biomedical data to provide personalized insights, aiding physicians in combating cognitive decline. Their platform streamlines diagnostics and reporting, enhancing both clinical outcomes and financial efficiency for brain health care providers.\n\nThe team, led by founder and neuroscientist Owen Philips, has a personal connection to their mission. Owen’s own experience with a family member’s untreated dementia emphasized the urgent need for better brain health solutions. This insight drives BrainKey to develop tools that not only detect but also prevent cognitive decline, aligning patient needs with targeted treatment recommendations.\n\n### What BrainKey Offers:\n1. **3D Brain Visualization**: Explore over 25 brain regions in 3D—an unprecedented perspective for patients that ordinary scans fail to provide.\n  \n2. **Genetic Insights**: Users can upload genetic data from services like 23andMe to understand genetic influences on their brain longevity.\n\n3. **Actionable Recommendations**: The platform offers tailored suggestions on nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes based on individual brain data.\n\n4. **Track Progress**: Users can measure and track changes in brain structure over time—akin to health metrics we monitor for other parts of the body.\n\n5. **BrainAge Calculator**: Leverage cutting-edge neuroscience to compare actual age with the calculated age of one’s brain, helping users gauge their cognitive health.\n\n### Adoption and Impact:\nThe user stories are compelling. From ease of data transfer between doctors to thrilling experiences seeing their own brains in 3D, users have shared how BrainKey not only enhances their understanding of brain health but makes ongoing health management effortless.\n\nBrainKey is more than a tech solution; it's a lifeline in the quest for understanding and addressing one of humanity’s most frightening health challenges—dementia. As they expand their capabilities and user base, they're redefining how we think about our brain health, making it accessible, understandable, and actionable. \n\nCurious to maximize your brain's potential?
