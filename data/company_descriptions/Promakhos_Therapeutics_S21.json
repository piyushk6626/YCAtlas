The resulting chronic inflammation can damage the body and lead to further disease. Current therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, and ankylosing spondylitis often work by suppressing the immune system, and treat symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of the disease. However, only 25% of patients benefit from these therapies long term. What if \u2013 instead of working against the immune system \u2013 we figured out how to restore its balance and function?Promakhos Therapeutics aims to do just this. Founded in the spring of 2021 and based in Boston, Massachusetts, we develop transformative therapies that restore the function of the immune system, allowing the body to control inflammation and heal.\\n# Meet the team\\nWe are entrepreneurs, scientists and drug discovery professionals.\\n![Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60162107d3effb6f041245eb/65c2689cb6f40f737de939f6_Katerina_500px_reducedsize.png)\\nBio\\n## Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.\\n### Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President\\n![Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60162107d3effb6f041245eb/65c2689cb6f40f737de939f6_Katerina_500px_reducedsize.png)\\n[![LinkedIn Logo.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f08987a4affa2787555ddd9/608f66f8b7c61ad0d7e1ff91_In-Blue-Logo.png.original.png)](https://www.promakhos.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/katerina-chatzi-phd-366625179/>)[![Publication list](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f08987a4affa2787555ddd9/614baec336fecf99b2f048e2_Graduation-Cap.png)](https://www.promakhos.com/<https:/scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cn25Hj4AAAAJ>)![Email Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f08987a4affa2787555ddd9/60aeb905d2ecff3be04d2dd6_Email-icon_blue.png)[![Twitter](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f08987a4affa2787555ddd9/614ce97df55d556b7537161e_2021%20Twitter%20logo%20-%20blue.png)](https://www.promakhos.com/<https:/twitter.com/katerina_hatzi>)\\n**Postdoc, Molecular and Cellular Biology** Harvard University\\n**Postdoc, Biophysics** KU Leuven\\n\\u200d**PhD., Biochemistry and Microbiology\\u200d** Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology\\n## Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.\\n### Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President\\nKaterina Chatzi is a co-founder and the Chief Executive Officer and President of Promakhos Therapeutics.

Jasper is an entrepreneurial, pioneering and innovative scientist with a background in microbiology, immunology, cell biology, target identification and validation, drug discovery and functional genomics. His commitment to entrepreneurship, scientific inquiry and translational research stems from his natural curiosity for biology and biotechnology, which manifested as he grew up in the Netherlands.\\nJasper performed his Ph.D. studies at the Rega Institute for Medical Research at the KU Leuven, Belgium. He was among the first scientists to apply CRISPR/Cas to genetically engineer human cells. Jasper collaborated with Karyopharm Therapeutics to validate the mechanism of action of the now marketed anticancer drug Selinexor (XPOVIO\u00ae) and the clinical stage drug KPT-9274. In Belgium, Jasper also invented a CRISPR-based genetic screening approach for identification of the cellular target of new candidate drugs.\\nJasper arrived in the USA as a postdoctoral fellow at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard to spearhead a team of researchers to identify and validate new therapeutic targets for cancer. He quickly distinguished himself and was awarded a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation fellowship. As a fellow, Jasper developed an updated compendium of synthetic lethal interactions in cancer, helped identify new metabolic vulnerabilities in pancreatic cancer and continued developing new CRISPR/Cas applications. His work has nominated several new high-priority therapeutic targets for cancer and has led to the initiation of new drug discovery campaigns. As a rising scientific leader, Jasper was on his way to become an assistant professor after receiving the National Cancer Institute Pathway to Independence Award for Outstanding Early-Stage Postdoctoral Researchers. However, ultimately, Jasper wants his research to translate into patient impact and felt that an academic career would not provide the right environment to pursue his vision. So, he handed back his million-dollar grant money and joined Katerina to co-found Promakhos Therapeutics.\\n[\u2716](https://www.promakhos.com/<#>)\\n![Sof\u00eda M.

He is fascinated by the interplay between the immune system (and in extension the body) and the commensal microbes and their associated (by)products. By understanding and leveraging this interplay, he strongly believes that we can develop meaningful and safe immunomodulatory drugs to treat and cure disease.\\nJuan has designed, executed, and supervised a large range of _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies to evaluate immune signaling and candidate molecules for go/no-go drug development decisions within pharma (Novartis, Pfizer, Vedanta Biosciences) and academia (UCSF). He has built and managed R&D labs of newly formed biotechnology companies (Vedanta, Commence) and advised life sciences companies on science strategy and operations at LabCentral. His work has directly contributed to the advancement of several drug candidates to preclinical testing and of VE303 (Vedanta) to the clinic. Most recently, Juan was a Principal Scientist at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research and established a discovery platform harnessing the gastrointestinal microbiome to identify next-generation small molecules for autoimmune and allergic conditions, with a focus on discovering therapeutics that promote wound healing and epithelial barrier function in inflammatory bowel disease. \\nEarly on, Juan has helped shaped our understanding of the role of major histocompatibility (MHC) class II restricted antigen processing and presentation in the central nervous system and in the role played by myelin-specific antibodies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis. He has also been involved in studies characterizing the mechanism and protective effect of glatirameracetate (Copaxone), atorvastatin (Lipitor) and anti-CD20 antibody (Rituxan) in CNS autoimmune disease. Juan then joined the multiple sclerosis group at Pfizer to support the discovery and development of new drugs. There, he evaluated new anti-inflammatory biologics and small molecules. As the role of the microbiome in human health became established, he led evaluated natural ligand derivatives for their ability to promote immunotolerance and mucosal repair in inflammatory bowel disease.\\n[\u2716](https://www.promakhos.com/<#>)\\n![Tomi K.

The resulting chronic inflammation can damage the body and lead to further disease. Current therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, and ankylosing spondylitis often work by suppressing the immune system, and treat symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of the disease. However, only 25% of patients benefit from these therapies long term. What if \u2013 instead of working against the immune system \u2013 we figured out how to restore its balance and function?Promakhos Therapeutics aims to do just this. Founded in the spring of 2021 and based in Boston, Massachusetts, we develop transformative therapies that restore the function of the immune system, allowing the body to control inflammation and heal.\\n# Meet the team\\nWe are entrepreneurs, scientists and drug discovery professionals.\\n![Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.\u27e87\u27e9]\\nBio\\n## Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.\\n### Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President\\n![Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.\u27e87\u27e9]\\n![LinkedIn Logo.\u27e88\u27e9](https://www.promakhos.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/in/katerina-chatzi-phd-366625179/>)![Publication list\u27e89\u27e9](https://www.promakhos.com/<https:/scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cn25Hj4AAAAJ>)![Email Icon\u27e810\u27e9]![Twitter\u27e811\u27e9](https://www.promakhos.com/<https:/twitter.com/katerina_hatzi>)\\n**Postdoc, Molecular and Cellular Biology** Harvard University\\n**Postdoc, Biophysics** KU Leuven\\n\\u200d**PhD., Biochemistry and Microbiology\\u200d** Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology\\n## Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.\\n### Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President\\nKaterina Chatzi is a co-founder and the Chief Executive Officer and President of Promakhos Therapeutics.

His work has directly contributed to the advancement of several drug candidates to preclinical testing and of VE303 (Vedanta) to the clinic. Most recently, Juan was a Principal Scientist at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research and established a discovery platform harnessing the gastrointestinal microbiome to identify next-generation small molecules for autoimmune and allergic conditions, with a focus on discovering therapeutics that promote wound healing and epithelial barrier function in inflammatory bowel disease. \\nEarly on, Juan has helped shaped our understanding of the role of major histocompatibility (MHC) class II restricted antigen processing and presentation in the central nervous system and in the role played by myelin-specific antibodies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis. He has also been involved in studies characterizing the mechanism and protective effect of glatirameracetate (Copaxone), atorvastatin (Lipitor) and anti-CD20 antibody (Rituxan) in CNS autoimmune disease. Juan then joined the multiple sclerosis group at Pfizer to support the discovery and development of new drugs. There, he evaluated new anti-inflammatory biologics and small molecules. As the role of the microbiome in human health became established, he led evaluated natural ligand derivatives for their ability to promote immunotolerance and mucosal repair in inflammatory bowel disease.\\n\u2716\u27e812\u27e9\\n![Tomi K.

    "generated_description": "**Promakhos Therapeutics: A New Frontier in Inflammatory Disease Treatment**\n\nFounded in 2021 and based in Boston, Promakhos Therapeutics is on a mission to revolutionize the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Their approach is refreshing and bold; instead of just suppressing the immune system\u2014which is the standard method for treating chronic inflammatory diseases today\u2014they aim to restore its inherent ability to regulate inflammation and facilitate healing.\n\n### The Beginning and Future Directions\n\nInitially, Promakhos began by focusing on leveraging bacterial molecules to enhance the body\u2019s innate immune response. Their first target? Crohn's disease, which carries a staggering annual treatment cost of around $10 billion in the U.S. Following Crohn's, they plan to tackle type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis\u2014conditions that also stem from immune system dysregulation.\n\n### A Small but Mighty Team\n\nWith a compact team of just two full-time employees, Promakhos is powered by the vision of Co-founders **Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.**, and **Jasper E. Neggers, Ph.D.** Both bring extensive backgrounds in biology and immunology, complemented by their entrepreneurial spirit. Their impressive track records include postdoctoral work at prestigious institutions like Harvard University and KU Leuven, where they honed their expertise in research, business development, and drug discovery.\n\n### Innovative Therapeutics Platform\n\nPromakhos is not just another biotech company. They're developing a unique therapeutics platform that centers on treating the root causes of inflammatory diseases\u2014an approach that very few in the industry are taking. Instead of simply managing symptoms, they aim to fundamentally change how chronic inflammation is addressed. As they grow, their platform may become a pivotal part of modern medicine in managing autoimmune conditions.\n\n### Awards and Recognition\n\nRecognizing its innovative approach and potential impact, Promakhos has garnered attention from organizations like Y Combinator and the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center. Their recent achievements include winning the **Massachusetts Next Generation Initiative Award**, awarded to women-led startups that show promise. They also received a **$272,000 NIH Phase 1 SBIR grant** to develop an oral immunomodulating therapy specifically focusing on Crohn's disease.\n\n### Future Aspirations\n\nPromakhos Therapeutics is clearly on the rise, combining scientific innovation with strategic foresight to create therapies that could alleviate the burden of chronic diseases affecting millions. Their mission aligns well with modern healthcare's need for effective solutions that prioritize restoring rather than suppressing our bodies' natural functions.\n\nIn short, if you\u2019re looking at the biotech landscape through the lens of inflammation and autoimmunity, keep your eyes on Promakhos Therapeutics. They might just be the game-changer we've all been waiting for. \n\nTo learn more about their groundbreaking work, you can visit their [website](https://www.promakhos.com).",
