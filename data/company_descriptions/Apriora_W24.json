Positioned within Y Combinator's Batch W24, Apriora's mission is clear: it aims to serve as your AI recruiter for interviewing and identifying the best talent quickly and efficiently.\n\n**How Apriora Works**\n\nThe heart of Apriora's offering is Alex, an AI-driven interview platform that conducts live video interviews with candidates. It allows companies to customize interview questions tailored to specific roles, or leverage AI-recommended questions based on job descriptions. During these interactive sessions, Alex can engage with candidates in real time, prompting personalized follow-up questions based on their responses.

By enhancing candidate engagement through live, two-way conversations, it ensures that companies don’t miss out on promising talent, transforming the traditionally labor-intensive recruitment landscape.\n\n**Client & Candidate Testimonials**\n\nAccording to users, candidates appreciate being able to engage in detailed, personal conversations during their interviews with Alex. Recruiters report that this system has redefined their capacity to evaluate candidates, eliminating traditional limitations on the number of interviews conducted daily.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIn an era where time is money, Apriora's blend of AI and human-like interaction in recruitment represents a promising shift in how businesses identify and interact with potential hires. Their adept AI not only enhances recruiter productivity but also enriches the candidate experience, paving the way for a new standard in hiring practices.\n\nFor more information, visit: [Apriora's Website](https://www.apriora.ai)."
