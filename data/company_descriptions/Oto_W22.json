  "generated_description": "Oto is a London-based health tech startup founded in 2019, with a mission focused on providing digital therapy for tinnitus—a condition that affects about one in eight people and was previously managed only through costly specialist consultations. Oto streamlines this process, offering a clinically validated digital program to manage tinnitus effectively and at a fraction of traditional treatment costs.\n\nPart of the Y Combinator Batch W22, Oto operates with a lean team of five and has ben supported by prestigious partners including Innovate UK, the University of Cambridge, and NHS Mid and South Essex. Their platform taps into cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)—a proven method for alleviating tinnitus symptoms. With a reported success rate of 96%, the program guarantees measurable results.\n\nWe've all been there, tuning out of conversations because of that constant ringing or buzzing in our ears. Oto understands this struggle, creating programs that require just 10 minutes of daily commitment. These personalized audio sessions mimic in-person therapy, helping users regain control over their condition with unlimited expert support.\n\nOto’s offerings don't stop at audio therapy; they’ve developed an app that provides 100+ sounds, sleep courses, focus strategies, and exclusive events with leading tinnitus experts. Real users share heartfelt testimonials, highlighting transformations from overwhelming anxiety to regained peace and control.\n\nIf you're battling tinnitus and tired of being told, \"Just learn to live with it,\" Oto might be the lifeline you need. Discover more about their innovative approach and how to start your journey towards relief at [joinoto.com](https://www.joinoto.com)."
