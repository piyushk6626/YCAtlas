This New York-based startup has a nimble team of five that’s laser-focused on helping finance professionals discover and enhance profiles of companies and individuals. \n\n**Mission and Offerings**\n\nCapix's mission is straightforward: simplify the often cumbersome process of sourcing deals in the investment landscape. At its core, Capix integrates data from a myriad of sources to create customizable profiles with robust filtering options. Whether you’re generating outreach lists for investment opportunities or compiling buyer lists, Capix acts as a one-stop-shop that merges public and premium data sources seamlessly.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nThe platform allows users to describe what they're looking for in plain English, eliminating the need for convoluted code or queries. For instance, an investment banker could simply request \"early-stage biotech startups in Boston that raised Series A in the last two years.\" Capix’s AI agents then conduct thorough searches, presenting results with complete transparency and traceability— all while enriching those results with additional data such as location, funding stage, and leadership profiles.\n\n**Advanced Features and Integrity**\n\nIn an age where data can be fragmented and unreliable, Capix promises unmatched coverage. It taps into both public databases and premium data resources like Pitchbook to ensure users have access to high-quality, comprehensive information—all delivered through a user-friendly interface. The security of this data handling is noteworthy, mentioning their compliance with SOC 2 standards, making it a trustworthy option for enterprises.\n\n**Use Cases**\n\nCapix caters to a diverse clientele by supporting various use cases: \n- **Recruiting**: Build targeted pipelines to find top talent quickly.\n- **Investing**: Identify high-potential opportunities for investment.\n- **Sales**: Create efficient lead lists to close deals faster.\n- **Research**: Conduct competitive intelligence with ease.\n\n**Get Involved**\n\nCurrently in private beta, Capix invites interested parties to join a waitlist for early access. By sharing specific use cases, potential users can receive tailored search results for free, making it easy and low-risk to try out this innovative tool.\n\nIn conclusion, Capix is poised to transform the way finance professionals access and utilize data for deal sourcing. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, they democratize access to comprehensive and actionable insights, enabling smarter decision-making in the fast-paced world of finance. So if you’re in the market for a streamlined approach to finding investment opportunities or enhancing your outreach, keeping an eye on Capix might be worth your while.\n\nFor more information, visit [Capix.ai](http://capix.ai/)."
