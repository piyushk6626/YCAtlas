  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Snowpilot**\n\nSnowpilot is a burgeoning startup located in the heart of San Francisco, founded in 2024 by Ben and Dom, two veterans from the data-centric cloud landscape. Their mission? To break down data silos with a connected spreadsheet that empowers users, particularly product managers, marketers, and sales teams, to leverage big data effortlessly. \n\nThe platform marries a friendly spreadsheet interface with a powerful federated data engine that pulls live data from tools like Salesforce, Gong, and Mixpanel. This seamless integration allows users to execute high-impact workflows without the usual complexities associated with big data analytics. \n\n**Founders’ Background:**\nBen and Dom's partnership blossomed at Census, a data startup backed by heavyweights like Sequoia and a16z, where they laid the foundation for a real-time, warehouse-native customer data platform. Each brings a stellar pedigree to Snowpilot: Dom has extensive experience in machine learning from his time at Adobe, where he led a team to create an ad optimization platform capable of managing a billion-dollar budget. Meanwhile, Ben developed the microservices that powered Microsoft Edge, scaling it from zero to hundreds of millions of daily active users.\n\n**What They’ve Built:**\nSince kicking off development in August 2024, Snowpilot has already delivered a live application capable of executing sub-second queries on millions of rows—all in the user’s browser. That's a major feat, especially given the typical hurdles associated with real-time data processing.\n\n**Market Opportunity:**\nSnowpilot enters a competitive landscape, looking to disrupt the $10 billion data warehouse market, which is currently growing at an impressive 23% year over year. Their focus is on democratizing access to big data, enabling not just engineers but everyday users to tap into sophisticated data analytics.\n\nAs a participant in Y Combinator's Batch S24, Snowpilot is poised for rapid growth and innovation. Despite having a lean team of just two, with Aaron Epstein as their Group Partner, they demonstrate a clear commitment to scalability and impact.\n\nIf you’re interested in how Snowpilot is redefining data accessibility, check out their website at [snowpilot.com](https://www.snowpilot.com). It’s clear that they are on an exciting trajectory to revolutionize the way businesses interact with data."
