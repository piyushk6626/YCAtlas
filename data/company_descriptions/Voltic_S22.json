  "generated_description": "**Voltic: Changing the Face of Shipping with Electric Cargo Ships**\n\nFounded in 2022 and now a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch S22, Voltic is on a mission to revolutionize the shipping industry by developing electric cargo ships powered predominantly by solar energy. The company has its eyes set on a significant goal: to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions associated with shipping, aiming to eliminate 2.2% of global CO2 emissions, alongside reducing costs by an impressive 50-75%, depending on the route.\n\n### What Makes Voltic Stand Out?\n\n1. **Eco-Friendly Innovation**: Voltic's electric cargo ships are designed to be both environmentally friendly and economically viable. This approach places them at the forefront of the industry’s push towards decarbonization, especially as new EU and IMO regulations come into play in the coming years. Their ships are expected not only to meet but exceed the reliability standards of traditional vessels, featuring backup diesel systems for safety.\n\n2. **High-Impact Solutions**: The numbers speak for themselves. Alongside the reduction of CO2 emissions, Voltic's technology promises to cut down 15% of global NOx and 13% of SOx emissions—making significant strides in combatting air pollution.\n\n3. **Global Reach**: Voltic offers a variety of coastal and trans-oceanic routes, catering to requests from freight forwarders and cargo owners. Key routes include Asia to Los Angeles, Asia to Europe, and various inter-Asia connections. This positions Voltic well to become a preferred choice for shippers around the world.\n\n4. **Speed Without Compromise**: One common misconception about transitioning to greener transportation options is the need to compromise on speed. Voltic debunks this myth, ensuring their zero-emission ships maintain the same transit times that shippers are accustomed to.\n\n### The Team and Support\n\nOperating with a lean team of five based in Cambridge, MA, Voltic is backed by Harj Taggar, their Group Partner from Y Combinator. Their small size suggests agility and close-knit collaboration, essential for innovating rapidly in a competitive space.\n\n### The Bigger Picture\n\nAs global shipping continues to grapple with its impact on climate change, Voltic stands as a beacon of hope and a model for what future shipping might look like. Their blend of sustainability and profitability could very well pave the way for broader industry changes, challenging rivals to rethink their operational strategies.\n\nFrom cutting emissions to providing reliable shipping solutions at competitive prices, Voltic is not just participating in the future of shipping; it's leading the charge towards a more sustainable and efficient industry. \n\nFor more information about their innovative solutions and routes, check out their [website](https://volticshipping.com/)."
