  "generated_description": "Wright Electric is on a mission to revolutionize air travel with electric planes—sort of like Boeing, but cleaner and more cost-effective. Founded in 2016 and a proud participant of Y Combinator's W17 batch, the company is headquartered in Albany, NY. With a small but focused team of just four employees, Wright Electric is making big strides in the aerospace sector.\n\nTheir flagship aircraft, the Wright 1, is a 186-passenger electric airplane designed for shorter, high-traffic routes such as Los Angeles to San Francisco and London to Paris. They aim to deliver air travel that’s not only budget-friendly but also prioritizes safety and, crucially, boasts zero emissions. They are currently collaborating with airlines like easyJet and VivaAerobus, laying the groundwork for a clean-air future in aviation.\n\nWright Electric’s innovations don’t stop at aircraft. They are developing ultra-lightweight motors, generators, and batteries specifically tailored for aerospace and defense applications, which is a significant contributor to their goal of lowering aircraft operating costs.\n\nIf you're interested in following their journey or learning more about their technology, check out their website at [weflywright.com](http://www.weflywright.com). They are all about pushing the boundaries of what is possible in flight, keeping in mind the planet's health as they soar through the skies."
