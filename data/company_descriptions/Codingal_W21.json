  "description": "Codingal (www.codingal.com) is a leading online after-school where kids & teens learn coding from expert instructors through live, interactive classes. Our mission is to build the world’s largest & most loved programming school for kids & teens, powered by human & AI tutors.\r\n\nMany countries have great technical universities but literally zero programming education at the K-12 level. Parents want their kids to get started with programming earlier, and that's why they use Codingal.\r\n\nAll our instructors come from Computer Science background, and they are rigorously vetted and trained. Every student gets a personalized learning path and individual attention in 1:1 private classes or small group classes with expert instructors. Students learn by building apps, games, animations, and websites in a fun & engaging way.\r\n\nKids find it so fun & engaging that NPS is just outstanding - 86. They have rated teachers at 4.9 out of 5. Curriculum content is rated at 4.8 out of 5.\r\n\nCodingal is on a mission to inspire kids to fall in love with coding, and provide the right education to them who will be able to create anything they can imagine and build the future when they grow up to become entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists.",

Coding provides a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships, and jobs. In addition, basic programming knowledge can change how kids and teens interact daily with the technologies they use. It’s a basic literacy–one we can’t afford to overlook.\\nMy child is a beginner, is previous coding experience required?\\nOur coding courses for kids and teens have been developed so that a complete beginner can follow along without any trouble. With technology increasingly prevalent across so many industries, even basic coding knowledge can help kids and teens regardless of the career they ultimately decide to pursue.\\nWhat is the recommended age for my child to start coding?\\nKids can start learning to code as early as 5-6 years old. When kids learn to code, it’s typically done under the guidance of a game. This makes the process fun and engaging while the kids are still learning a new skill. Our highly qualified Computer Science teachers at Codingal break the complex concepts into small digestible chunks for your child. Kids who learn to code when they’re young can set themselves up for a lifetime of opportunities for success.\\nWhat courses does Codingal offer?\\nCodingal currently offers live online coding classes for kids and teens. Our coding courses include Scratch Programming, Python for kids and teens, AI and Machine Learning, App Development, Web Development, Game Development, Data Science for kids, and many other courses for Grade 1-12 students from age 5 years to age 17 years.\\nHow will I stay updated on my child’s progress?\\nA key aspect of our coding courses for kids and teens is keeping parents informed on what happens during the online coding class. We conduct the first Parent Teacher Meeting(PTM) after the 6th session, and the second meeting is conducted after the 12th session. As the course progresses, the PTM happens after every 12th session. Parents receive progress reports after every Parent Teacher Meeting that indicate what students have done during their classes and have links to their projects. Besides regular email updates on the kid's progress, parents and teachers are welcome to audit a current class or review recorded sessions of completed classes.\\nHow does Codingal select the best Coding Teachers?\\nCodingal’s teachers are experts in computer science, backed with years of industry and teaching experience, and passionate about teaching kids and teens. We hire only the top 1% of applicants who are vetted for their technical skills and communication skills. A thorough background check is also done. We train our teachers to help them continue improving their skills with continuous teacher observation and feedback.

Coding provides a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships, and jobs. In addition, basic programming knowledge can change how kids and teens interact daily with the technologies they use. It’s a basic literacy–one we can’t afford to overlook.\\nMy child is a beginner, is previous coding experience required?\\nOur coding courses for kids and teens have been developed so that a complete beginner can follow along without any trouble. With technology increasingly prevalent across so many industries, even basic coding knowledge can help kids and teens regardless of the career they ultimately decide to pursue.\\nWhat is the recommended age for my child to start coding?\\nKids can start learning to code as early as 5-6 years old. When kids learn to code, it’s typically done under the guidance of a game. This makes the process fun and engaging while the kids are still learning a new skill. Our highly qualified Computer Science teachers at Codingal break the complex concepts into small digestible chunks for your child. Kids who learn to code when they’re young can set themselves up for a lifetime of opportunities for success.\\nWhat courses does Codingal offer?\\nCodingal currently offers live online coding classes for kids and teens. Our coding courses include Scratch Programming, Python for kids and teens, AI and Machine Learning, App Development, Web Development, Game Development, Data Science for kids, and many other courses for Grade 1-12 students from age 5 years to age 17 years.\\nHow will I stay updated on my child’s progress?\\nA key aspect of our coding courses for kids and teens is keeping parents informed on what happens during the online coding class. We conduct the first Parent Teacher Meeting(PTM) after the 6th session, and the second meeting is conducted after the 12th session. As the course progresses, the PTM happens after every 12th session. Parents receive progress reports after every Parent Teacher Meeting that indicate what students have done during their classes and have links to their projects. Besides regular email updates on the kid's progress, parents and teachers are welcome to audit a current class or review recorded sessions of completed classes.\\nHow does Codingal select the best Coding Teachers?\\nCodingal’s teachers are experts in computer science, backed with years of industry and teaching experience, and passionate about teaching kids and teens.

We train our teachers to help them continue improving their skills with continuous teacher observation and feedback. Our teachers are best-in-class who are on a mission to inspire kids to fall in love with coding.\\nHow do I teach coding to my child?\\nCoding is a skill that requires specialized knowledge. While there are many resources available online that can help you catch up on the basics and start teaching coding to your child. However, the best and most effective way to teach a child to code is by ensuring they have a qualified and trained computer science teacher to guide them on their coding journey. Try a free 1-on-1 coding class for kids and teens⟨115⟩ to get started.\\nCan my child learn coding for free?\\nThere is no shortage of websites and platforms that offer free access to resources to teach coding to kids and teens. However, every child learns differently and at a different pace, and guided learning is a far more effective method for teaching kids to code. Coding is a specialized subject and Coding instructors with Computer Science background are best suited to teach it in a live format. Your child will develop interest in coding with right guidance from the teachers. You can try a free lesson with Codingal to experience the magical world of coding.\\nAre there any games to teach coding to kids?\\nThere are quite a few games that kids can learn coding from, like Minecraft, Code Monster, RoboZZle, Blockly Games, etc. are some of the popular ones.\\nWhat are the best apps for kids to learn coding?\\nMany apps make coding fun and interactive for young children. Codingal, Scratch, Blockly, MIT App Inventor are suitable for those just starting. Intermediate coders who want to build an app or website can check out Codingal, CodeCombat, Stencyl, and Code.org. Advanced coders can also participate in coding competitions and hackathons organized by IOI, Codeforces, and Codingal.\\nIs the coding course schedule flexible?\\nYes!
