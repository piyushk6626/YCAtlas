While DBS can have a tremendous positive impact on the daily live of patients, a range of side-effects can be associated with the therapy. Some of these side-effects are the due to off-target stimulation. Off-target stimulation happens because the electrodes that are used in deep brain stimulation are relatively large compared to the brain regions they are targeting. As a result, the DBS electrodes induce electric fields with low spatial resolution that extend beyond the target brain region and activate neighboring brain regions and passing axonal pathways. Every year we learn more about the complex anatomy of the deep brain regions that are targeted in DBS, including the connectivity patterns with other brain regions. Equipped with this knowledge, existing electrode technologies need to be innovated to enable more precise targeting in deep brain regions to avoid unnecessary damage, induce less side effects and achieve better long-term efficacy of the stimulation.\\n![Why the need for closed-loop deep brain stimulation?](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com/media/why-the-need-bg-v4.jpg)\\nAbout\\n## Why the need for closed-loop deep brain stimulation?\\nExisting commercial DBS electrodes stimulate continuously without ongoing information about local neural activity. Over time however, the brain becomes less responsive to the stimulation, resulting in the need for re-programming of the DBS parameters. This re-programming often requires multiple visits to the clinic, which is time-consuming and stressful for the patient. Continuous stimulation also drain battery power of the associated implanted pulse generator (IPG), leading to IPG replacement surgeries. A need exists therefore for a closed-loop device in which neural activity can be sensed continuously in the brain during stimulation. A closed-loop sensing and stimulation platform will allow for automatic adjustment of stimulation parameters based on the continuous sensing of local neural activity patterns, eliminating the need for lengthy and ad-hoc DBS re-programming. \\n![How do we create high-precision and closed-loop devices?](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com/media/how-do-we-bg2.jpg)\\nAbout\\n## How do we create high-precision and closed-loop DBS devices?\\nWe use micro-and nano-fabrication manufacturing technologies to create electrode leads that are almost invisible to the eye and yet contain many individual micro-electrodes that can each sense neural activity and can electrically stimulate with high spatial resolution in the brain. Individual electrodes are 150 times smaller than existing DBS lead electrodes and can achieve stimulation down to single neuron precision, while the leads retain the ability to stimulate larger regions of brain tissue. The micro-electrode leads are developed in parallel with an electronic chip for readout of signals and control over stimulation, which will eventually replace the big and bulky implantable pulse generators associated with current DBS systems. A machine learning driven data analysis platform analyzes the data and makes predictive assessments that are used to drive automated adjustment of stimulation parameters in response to locally recorded neural activity. \\n### Contact Us!\\n×\\nName(Required)\\nFirst Last\\nAddress(Required)\\nStreet Address\\nPhone Numbers(Required)\\nEmail(Required)\\nMessage here\\n![Footer background image](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com/media/footer-bg.jpg)\\n## Be A Part Of The Journey\\n[Get In Touch](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com/<javascript:void\\\\(0\\\\);>)\\n© 2025 Torpedo Therapeutics\\nNotifications\\n' markdown_with_citations='![Torpedo Therapeutics Logo⟨1⟩](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com/<https:/www.torpedotherapeutics.com/>)\\n  * About⟨2⟩\\n\\n\\nContact Us⟨3⟩;>)\\n![Homepage Banner Image⟨4⟩]\\nOur mission is to enable\\n# High-precision, closed-loop deep brain stimulation therapy to treat neurological disorders\\nLearn More⟨3⟩;>)\\n## Features\\n![Protein Icon⟨5⟩]\\n## High-Precision Stimulation\\n[](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com/<https:/www.torpedotherapeutics.com/#about>)\\n![Platform Icon⟨6⟩]\\n## Closed-loop Sensing and Stimulation\\n[](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com/<https:/www.torpedotherapeutics.com/#atag>)\\n![Source Icon⟨7⟩]\\n## Automated Data Analysis Platform\\n[](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com/<https:/www.torpedotherapeutics.com/#hpcld>)\\n![About Section Image⟨8⟩]\\nAbout\\n## Why the need for high-precision deep brain stimulation?\\nDeep-brain stimulation, or DBS, is an existing, FDA approved therapy for Parkinson’s disease, Essential Tremor, Dystonia and drug-resistant Epilepsy.

  "generated_description": "### Torpedo Therapeutics: Revolutionizing Neuromodulation\n\n**Company Overview:**\nFounded in 2018, Torpedo Therapeutics is a Boston-based startup specializing in neurotechnology. As part of Y Combinator's W22 batch, they engage a nimble team of five dedicated employees. Their focus is on developing high-precision, closed-loop neuromodulation devices that enhance the efficacy and adoption of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies.\n\n**Mission:**\nTorpedo Therapeutics aims to transform the landscape of neurological disorder treatments by enabling high-precision and closed-loop deep brain stimulation therapy. They are working to refine existing FDA-approved therapies that currently help manage conditions like Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and epilepsy.\n\n**The Problem:** \nDeep brain stimulation has been a lifesaver for many, yet it’s not without its challenges. Current DBS technology often results in off-target stimulation—where the electrodes affect neighboring brain areas, leading to side effects. The existing models also use continuous stimulation without the ability to adapt in real-time to brain activity, necessitating manual reprogramming that can be stressful for patients.\n\n**The Solution:**\nTorpedo Therapeutics is addressing these issues through innovative technology. By utilizing micro- and nano-fabrication technologies, they are creating electrodes that are much smaller and thus more precise than their predecessors. These electrodes can stimulate at the level of individual neurons, greatly reducing unwanted side effects while enhancing the therapeutic impact. \n\nMoreover, Torpedo is developing a closed-loop system that continuously senses brain activity during stimulation. This allows the device to automatically adjust stimulation parameters based on real-time data, reducing the need for patient reprogramming and conserving battery life in their devices.\n\n**Technological Edge:**\nTheir technology stands out because:\n- **High-precision stimulation:** The micro-electrodes are 150 times smaller than current ones, enabling targeted stimulation that minimizes collateral impact.\n- **Closed-loop sensing:** This system adjusts stimulation in response to brain activity, vastly improving efficacy and user experience.\n- **Automated data analysis:** By employing machine learning, the platform interprets neural data and makes predictive adjustments, which translates into a more tailored patient treatment.\n\nWith a mission to enhance the quality of life for those living with neurological disorders, Torpedo Therapeutics is set to make significant strides in the neuromodulation space. To learn more about their ground-breaking work, visit their [website](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com). \n\nIn a field where innovation can redefine treatment approaches, Torpedo Therapeutics is definitely a company to watch."
