  "generated_description": "### Shape (ShapeScale) Overview\n\n**Company Name:** Shape (ShapeScale)  \n**Founded:** 2015  \n**Location:** San Francisco, California  \n**Website:** [shapescale.com](https://shapescale.com)  \n**Team Size:** 7 employees  \n**Backers:** Y Combinator (Batch S15)  \n\n---\n\n#### Mission: \nShapeScale is on a mission to revolutionize personal health tracking. It’s not just about stepping on a scale; it's about understanding your body in 3D. This innovative health tech startup has developed the ShapeScale—a personal 3D scanner and fitness tracker that helps users visualize their physical changes over time, identifying where fat is lost and muscle is gained.\n\n---\n\n#### Product Highlights:\n- **ShapeScale:** A state-of-the-art device that scans your body in photorealistic 3D, capturing every detail. This isn't just a fancy gimmick; it’s a powerful tool for anyone serious about tracking their fitness progress.\n- **Visual Feedback:** Users can see their changes through heatmaps that highlight specific areas where their body composition has evolved, making it easier to set and refine fitness goals.\n- **Health Scores:** The device provides actionable insights by generating health and body scores, helping users stay focused on areas that need improvement and gauge the effectiveness of their regimen.\n\n---\n\n#### Why It Matters:\nTraditional scales can often mislead. You might be losing fat but not seeing weight drop due to muscle gain. ShapeScale aims to change the conversation by introducing visuals as a driving force for motivation—after all, seeing is believing. \n\nAs Michael Seibel from Y Combinator puts it, \"It’s like a better mirror that gives you a clear, unbiased view of yourself.\" Moreover, fitness buffs and casual users alike will appreciate its utility; it acts like a personal trainer that can show your progress in a way that just stepping on a scale can’t.\n\n---\n\n#### What’s Next:\nShape (ShapeScale) is currently making strides in the health and fitness landscape, not just by selling a product, but by changing how people approach their wellness journey. Keep an eye on this company—it’s positioned at the intersection of hardware, computer vision, and consumer health services, and it's just getting started.\n\nIf you want to know more or see what ShapeScale can do for you, check out their [website](https://shapescale.com).\n\n---\n\n### In Conclusion:\nShape (ShapeScale) is reshaping personal health monitoring for the better. With a unique blend of technology and user-centric design, it empowers people to take charge of their fitness with confidence and clarity."
