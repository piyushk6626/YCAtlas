  "generated_description": "Kopra Bio is a captivating biotech startup based in San Francisco that is diving headfirst into the realm of cancer treatment. Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator‚Äôs S24 batch, their mission is bold yet clear: to harness genetically engineered viruses to teach the immune system to target and obliterate cancer cells.\n\nStarting with glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer, Kopra Bio aims to disrupt the current treatment landscape. They‚Äôve developed a technology that dramatically improves survival rates‚Äîtaking them from a dismal 0% with existing FDA-approved treatments to an impressive 90% with their innovative approach. This level of transformation mirrors what drugs like Keytruda have achieved, which have generated a staggering $25 billion a year.\n\nThe company operates with a lean team of two, demonstrating the belief that great innovation doesn‚Äôt always need a large workforce. They are at the intersection of gene therapy, synthetic biology, and oncology, and they‚Äôre tagged as disruptors in these fields as well as therapeutics and biotech.\n\nIn their own words, Kopra Bio describes its work as ‚Äúcancer immunotherapy that turns cancer cells into biofactories minting their own destruction.‚Äù This encapsulates their strategy of utilizing the cancer itself as a weapon against the disease.\n\nIf you‚Äôre curious to know more or want to reach out, their website is [kopra.bio](https://kopra.bio). Here‚Äôs a company that is not just aiming for the next big thing in medicine, but potentially rewriting how we approach cancer treatment altogether. Keep an eye on this one‚Äîgreat things could be on the horizon."
