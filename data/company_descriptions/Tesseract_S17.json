  "generated_description": "**Tesseract: Blazing New Trails in Satellite Propulsion**\n\nTesseract is a venture that emerged onto the scene in 2017, hailing from Livermore, California, and has since built itself a reputation as a forward-thinking provider of propulsion systems for modern satellites. Their mission? To construct better thrusters tailored for the next generation of space exploration. \n\nBacked by the esteemed Y Combinator Batch S17, Tesseract focuses on creating cost-effective propulsion components that serve a diverse array of applications—think commercial Earth-orbiting satellites, exploratory robotic missions, and even human spaceflight. But they’re not just about affordability; they take a hard stance on innovation, safety, and environmental responsibility. \n\nTesseract's approach is centered on **safer, low-toxicity propulsion systems**. They stand firmly against high toxicity heritage propellants, arguing that they have no place in today’s eco-conscious world. Their technology embraces modern materials and efficient manufacturing methods to keep costs down while maximizing value. This commitment to quality and reliability ensures that their products aren’t just economically viable—they’re also mission-critical, adhering to the stringent standards of aerospace hardware.\n\nTheir offerings are as versatile as they are ambitious. Tesseract designs and builds everything from off-the-shelf thrusters that can be purchased individually to custom-designed systems tailored to meet specific demands. Whether you need a simple module or a full propulsion system, Tesseract has you covered.\n\nWith a compact team of six and a focus sharp as their name suggests, Tesseract is carving out a place in the bustling world of space technology. They’re categorized under tags like 'space-exploration', 'satellites', and 'rocketry', reflecting their drive to reshape how we think about propulsion technology in the cosmos.\n\nIf you're curious to learn more about their innovative work, check out their website at [Tesseract Space](http://tesseract.space/). They're not just building thrusters; they’re launching a vision for the future of space travel."
