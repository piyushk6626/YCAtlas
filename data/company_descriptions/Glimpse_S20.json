Imagine a beverage company sold $100k worth of goods to Whole Foods & only got paid $60k. The deducted $40k comes in hundreds of long PDF’s with obscure codes that a team has to manually review every single one of to ensure the fees are valid. A % of these fees are always invalid and brands have to go through a lengthy process to get back money owed to them. We automate this whole process - saving a brand dozens of hours a week & recouping them 2-3% of their topline sales.",

  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Glimpse**\n\nGlimpse, founded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's S20 batch, is based in New York and operates with a lean team of three. The company has effectively carved out a niche by leveraging artificial intelligence to help retail-first consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands manage their finances more efficiently. \n\n**Mission & Services**\n\nThe primary mission of Glimpse is straightforward: to automate tedious cash reconciliation processes for brands that sell in retail. Let's break that down. Picture a beverage company that sells $100k worth of product to Whole Foods but only receives a meager $60k due to a slew of unexplained deductions. These deductions can be buried within mountains of paperwork, often making it hard to ascertain their validity. \n\nGlimpse steps in here, automating the entire deduction management process. By using AI to analyze and dispute these deductions, Glimpse helps brands reclaim invalid fees efficiently—recovering 2-3% of their top-line sales and saving dozens of hours of backbreaking manual work each week. \n\n**Key Features and Functionality**\n\n1. **Automated Categorization:** The platform swiftly imports and categorizes deductions in real-time, allowing brands to regain precious hours of their time.\n   \n2. **AI Dispute Engine:** Your in-house deductions expert can automatically identify invalid deductions, file disputes, and ensure follow-ups until any unjustified claims are resolved.\n\n3. **Integrated Reconciliation:** Glimpse streamlines the reconciliation of credit memos with integrations to popular accounting software like QuickBooks and NetSuite.\n\nGlimpse operates on a success-based pricing model—essentially, they only make money when their clients do.
