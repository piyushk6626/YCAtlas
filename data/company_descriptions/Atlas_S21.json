But it shouldnâ€™t be this tough. With Atlas, we are here to help you focus on things that matter. The business model for restaurants is fundamentally changing because everything is going online. People will transact more with their devices. Restaurants will need to find different ways to reach customers and optimise their operations (deliveries, pickup, pre-orders, social ordering, virtual brands, cloud kitchens, food aggregators, etc.).There will be a need for unified and seamless online and offline food commerce experiences.

  "generated_description": "Atlas is a Singapore-based company founded in 2021, part of Y Combinator Batch S21, that has set out to revolutionize the restaurant industry in Southeast Asia with its integrated operating system. Its mission is straightforward: to be the easiest way to start, run, and grow any restaurant, whether online or offline.\n\nThe brains behind Atlas come with serious credentialsâ€”they previously built Grain, a successful online restaurant that saw millions in revenue. This experience has equipped them with the insights to tackle the challenges restaurants face today, especially in a fast-evolving market that increasingly relies on digital solutions. The team boasts backgrounds from major players like Accenture, Microsoft, McKinsey, and Salesforce, which adds layers of depth to their expertise.\n\nAt its core, Atlasâ€™ tech simplifies multiple restaurant operationsâ€”serving as a unified platform where restaurant owners can manage online storefronts, point-of-sale systems, third-party logistics, menu syncs, and customer insights, all while leveraging AI to enhance services. Their offerings are designed to streamline processes across multiple channels, ensuring that restaurants can effectively cater to their customers regardless of the delivery mechanismâ€”be it dine-in, takeout, or third-party delivery platforms like Grab and Deliveroo.\n\nFor those restaurants just getting started, Atlas offers a basic package starting at $79/month with no hidden fees or long-term contracts. This allows restaurant operators to focus on what they do bestâ€”serve great foodâ€”while Atlas handles the heavy lifting in terms of technology. \n\nCurrently, Atlas has a lean team of 11 individuals, but they're making waves by delighting hundreds of restaurants across sunny Singapore. Their growth suggests not just strong demand but also validation of their product's effectiveness in navigating the complex landscape of restaurant management. They also offer a noteworthy, risk-free incentive: a 100-day money-back guarantee for users who arenâ€™t satisfied with their systems.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for a robust operating system tailored for the modern restaurant environment, look no further than Atlas. They are committed to helping restaurateurs not just survive, but thrive amidst the changing tides of the F&B industry.
