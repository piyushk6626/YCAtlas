  "generated_description": "**Carma: Your Go-To for Same-Day Auto Repair Solutions**\n\nFounded in 2023 and nestled in the heart of San Francisco, Carma is revolutionizing the automotive repair landscape for commercial fleet owners. The company's mission? To provide same-day auto repair with transparent pricing and instant offers—because waiting around for repairs is so last decade.\n\nThe backbone of Carma's operation is a B2B managed marketplace designed especially for fleet management. It taps into a massive market; globally, fleet owners shell out a staggering $573 billion annually on auto repairs. With Carma, they can significantly cut costs—saving up to 50% compared to regional median prices for similar services.\n\nHere’s how it works: fleet owners can submit service requests through the Carma mobile app. Once submitted, these requests are dispatched to a carefully vetted network of partner service centers. These centers deliver real-time offers on auto services, allowing customers to choose the best deal. It’s a win-win: fleet customers get expedited, cost-effective service, while partner centers boost their revenue streams and attract new clientele.\n\nIf you manage a commercial fleet, reaching out to Carma is as simple as calling or texting Muhammad, the CEO, at 636-293-5254, or emailing fleets@joincarma.com. For automotive service center owners looking to increase profitability, there's a similar invitation—contact Muhammad or email shops@joincarma.com. \n\nCarma is backed by Y Combinator and features a nimble team of 11 talented individuals. With the guidance of Group Partner Tom Blomfield, they’re well-positioned to disrupt the automotive service industry.\n\nWhat can you expect from Carma? \n\n1. **Competitive Offers:** Request service and get multiple real-time offers.\n2. **Transparent Pricing:** No hidden fees—what you see is what you pay.\n3. **Speedy Turnaround:** Get your vehicles serviced with guaranteed same-day service.\n4. **Diagnostics:** Unsure what’s wrong? Initiate a diagnostic request without burning hours.\n\nFor fleet management made easy and cost-effective, Carma is setting the standard. Their website, https://www.joincarma.com/, is the starting point for demo bookings and more information about their offerings.\n\nCarma is living proof that innovation thrives at the intersection of technology and industry needs. If you’ve got a fleet, it’s time to get onboard."
