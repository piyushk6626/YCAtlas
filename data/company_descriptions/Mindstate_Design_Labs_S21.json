His paradigm-shifting work has been featured in dozens of media outlets including Time Magazine, The New York Times, and Wired. Enrolling in university at the age of 16, as an undergraduate he was already publishing in the journal Science about new phenomena of nature he discovered with the natural history method. He brought the same natural history approach to the field of artificial life; with no training in computer science, he designed a new CPU architecture, a new operating system, and a new machine language. He created the first known instance of evolution by natural selection apart from life on earth - the first true artificial life program. For the past two decades he has devoted his research to the natural history study of psychedelic experience, synthesizing human experience data and biochemical data to develop hypotheses concerning the biological basis of the diverse varieties of psychedelic experience.

She created new biomarkers that enabled passive collection of informative health data during clinical trials and used those biomarkers to develop machine learning models that classified clinical diagnosis, estimated symptom severity, and predicted future clinical states.\\n\\u200d\\nAhnjili’s prior research has also explored the impacts of LSD, methylphenidate, and mindfulness on cognitive flexibility. In addition to her academic pursuits, she hosts workshops and installations that aim to demystify the mechanisms, biases, applications, and potential challenges associated with AI algorithms.\\n\\u200d\\nAhnjili holds a Bachelor\\'s Degree in Neuroscience from Edinburgh University and a Master\\'s Degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from Radboud University. In 2024, she will defend her thesis as a PhD candidate in Clinical Neuropharmacology & Applied Data Analytics at Leiden University.\\n\\u200d\\n[](http://mindstate.design/<#>)[](http://mindstate.design/<#>)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66ce4ce413719b04a44158fd/66ce4ce413719b04a44159bc_Anjhili%20ZhuParris%20-%20mindstatedesignlabs.jpg)\\nAhnjili ZhuParris\\nData Scientist\\n[![close icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66ce4ce413719b04a44158d4/66ce4ce413719b04a4415948_Group%2043.png)](http://mindstate.design/<#>)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66ce4ce413719b04a44158fd/66ce4ce413719b04a4415954_Bethany%20Leins%20\\\\(1\\\\).jpg)\\n### Bethany Leins, PMP\\nProject Manager, Drug Development\\nBethany Leins has over 25 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry with more than a decade in project management roles.

He brought the same natural history approach to the field of artificial life; with no training in computer science, he designed a new CPU architecture, a new operating system, and a new machine language. He created the first known instance of evolution by natural selection apart from life on earth - the first true artificial life program. For the past two decades he has devoted his research to the natural history study of psychedelic experience, synthesizing human experience data and biochemical data to develop hypotheses concerning the biological basis of the diverse varieties of psychedelic experience.

  "generated_description": "**Mindstate Design Labs** is a forward-thinking company focused on revolutionizing mental health treatments through next-generation psychedelic therapeutics. Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's S21 batch, the company is based in San Francisco and operates with a small but dedicated team of seven employees.\n\n### Mission & Vision\nThe core mission of Mindstate Design Labs is to develop novel altered states of consciousness that can address various mental health issues. They leverage cutting-edge technology, specifically machine learning, along with human experiential data and molecular pharmacology, to design these groundbreaking therapeutic interventions. \n\n### Innovative Approach\nAt the center of their innovation is a platform called **Osmanthus**, which uses natural history and biochemical data to create predictive models for designing altered states of consciousness with therapeutic potential. This approach addresses a significant challenge in psychedelic drug development: the lack of a reliable means to distinguish between different altered states. Mindstate aims to fill this gap, enabling precision in designing modified conscious states for therapeutic use.\n\n### Team & Expertise\nThe co-founders, **Dillan DiNardo** and **Thomas Ray, PhD**, are backed by a diverse team of experts. DiNardo has a strong background in biotechnology and venture capital, while Ray brings extensive knowledge from his work in evolutionary biology and the natural history study of psychedelic experiences. Their leadership team includes professionals with vast experience in drug discovery, clinical development, and regulatory affairs, ensuring a robust framework for the company’s research and development efforts.\n\n### Pipeline & Future Potential\nMindstate's pipeline includes using psychedelic \"primers\" and non-psychedelic \"probes\" to modulate therapeutic effects. They've already identified six unique probe candidates that show promise when combined with their lead primer compounds. This research has the potential to yield entirely new classes of therapies for mental health.\n\n### Community & Impact\nAs pioneers in the psychedelics space, Mindstate Design Labs is positioning itself at the forefront of a burgeoning field that aligns well with modern mental health needs. With increasing recognition in the media and a growing base of research backing their initiatives, they aim to impact the way mental health treatments are perceived and delivered.\n\n### Learn More\nFor more details on their exciting work and developments, visit [Mindstate Design Labs](http://mindstate.design). As they continue to evolve, they are always on the lookout for exceptional talent to join their innovative journey. This is a company that not only embraces technology but also seeks to drive significant human progress in mental health through psychedelic research."
