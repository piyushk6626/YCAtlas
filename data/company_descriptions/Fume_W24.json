  "generated_description": "Fume is an innovative startup aiming to reshape the landscape of software development with artificial intelligence. Founded in 2024 and a proud member of Y Combinator's W24 batch, Fume operates out of San Francisco with a compact team of two. Their mission? Building an AI software developer capable of tackling complex software tasks, making coding and debugging faster and easier.\n\nGone are the days of sifting through endless bugs and feature requests. With Fume, you simply tag them in Slack, and the AI works its magic—resolving issues in minutes. This kind of efficiency is appealing to any software team tired of the traditional, tedious processes. If you've ever found yourself cutting and pasting code into ChatGPT for help, Fume presents a seamless solution that doesn't require hopping between multiple platforms.\n\nFume provides its users the power to conduct rigorous testing without the usual headaches. The tool integrates into your workflow, allowing real-time testing of every code change, ensuring everything runs smoothly before merging. By scaling code reviews significantly, Fume transforms what’s often a bottleneck into a streamlined process, with actionable comments and multi-file changes ready to commit with just one click. They essentially offer a \"shadow engineering workforce\" that quietly handles the more tedious aspects of coding, leaving developers to focus on more impactful work.\n\nFor teams looking to benefit from Fume, they’ve rolled out a straightforward pricing model at $30 per engineer per month, which includes unlimited reviews and custom review guides. There's a 30-day free trial to get started, and setup takes just about 15 minutes.\n\nThey've caught the attention of over 100 teams, helping organizations like Hepsiburada and Mattermost ship code more effectively. With a robust set of features, including browser testing, unit testing, and custom scripts, Fume is positioned to redefine how developers interact with code, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with AI in software development. Curious to find out more? Check them out at [fumedev.com](https://fumedev.com) or reach out via email at emre@fumedev.com."
