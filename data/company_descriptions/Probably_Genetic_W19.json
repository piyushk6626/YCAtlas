As a Y Combinator Batch W19 company, it aims to identify and support patients dealing with severe, complex diseases through an innovative data platform. \n\n**Mission:**\nThe company's mission is straightforward yet profound: to transform the lives of those grappling with genetic diseases by ensuring timely access to diagnoses, clinical trials, and targeted treatments. By leveraging advanced machine learning and at-home testing, Probably Genetic finds undiagnosed patients and analyzes their conditions, streamlining the communication between patients, drug developers, and advocacy groups.\n\n**How It Works:**\nProbably Genetic's platform offers free genetic testing for over 4,000 diseases, allowing eligible patients to receive at-home test kits. With a simple saliva or cheek swab, patients can collect samples for analysis at a CLIA-certified lab. Importantly, their services are HIPAA-compliant, ensuring robust data privacy and protection.\n\n1. **Patient Enrollment:** Individuals complete a health assessment to determine eligibility for testing.\n2. **Home Testing Kits:** Upon approval, test kits are sent directly to patients’ homes for easy sample collection.\n3. **Results and Counseling:** Patients receive personalized genetic insights and have access to genetic counseling to understand their results.\n\n**Current Impact:**\n- **Patients Served:** Over 100,000 individuals have utilized the Probably Genetic platform.\n- **Partnerships:** Collaborating with more than 50 patient advocacy groups, the company fosters a supportive environment for patients seeking answers regarding their health.\n\n**Team and Leadership:**\nProbably Genetic operates with a focused team of nine employees and is led under the guidance of Michael Seibel as their Group Partner. This compact team is effectively making significant strides in the health-tech, biotech, and genomics sectors.\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nProbably Genetic is not just a service provider; it’s a beacon of hope for many who have faced years of uncertainty regarding their health. By simplifying access to genetic testing and connecting patients to the resources they need, it fills a critical gap in the healthcare system.\n\nTo discover if you or someone you know is eligible for free genetic testing, you can check out more at [Probably Genetic's Website](https://www.probablygenetic.com/).\n\nIn this rapidly evolving field, Probably Genetic stands out.
