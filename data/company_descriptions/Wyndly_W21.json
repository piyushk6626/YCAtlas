  "description": "Wyndly (https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient’s unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.\r\n\nWyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. \r\n\nYou can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).\r\n\nThe Wyndly Model \r\n\nAt Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.\r\n\nOnce we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.\r\n\nOur values\r\n\n**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.\r\n\n**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.\r\n\n**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow.\r\n\n**Progress**: We make something better every single day.\r\n\n*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*\r\n\nThe team\r\n\nWyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who’s a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth  engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021).",

By safely exposing your immune system to small doses of what you are allergic to, over time, your body becomes tolerant to your allergy triggers. This leads to a decrease in your allergy symptoms and can provide lifelong allergy relief. This also lets you avoid the negative side effects of allergy pills and sprays.\\nWhile antihistamines and nasal sprays can help manage symptoms when using the medications, allergy immunotherapy is the only scientifically proven method of creating long-term changes to your immune system to decrease symptoms. Wyndly makes lifelong allergy relief available to everyone through telemedicine and personalized allergy treatment plans.\\n[The American Academy of Otolaryngology](https://www.wyndly.com/<https:/bulletin.entnet.org/clinical-patient-care/article/22833790/a-quest-for-quality-of-life-for-allergy-sufferers?utm_source=organic&utm_medium=organic>) considers sublingual immunotherapy allergy drops capable of \"help[ing] patients experience relief from allergy symptoms and improve their overall quality of life.\"\\nIn 2003, and again in 2010,[ the Cochrane Review](https://www.wyndly.com/<https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21154351/?utm_source=organic&utm_medium=organic>), an independent health care researcher, concluded in a systematic review of the available research that sublingual allergy immunotherapy is both effective and safe.\\n#### What’s the Wyndly process like from start to finish?\\nTo start the Wyndly process, you’ll meet with a board-certified doctor to determine if Wyndly is a fit for you and set up an allergy consult.**Start with a consult.**\\nYou’ll speak with a board-certified doctor to determine your treatment plan. As doctors, we believe that the best medical care comes from collaboration between provider and patient as you start treatment. \\n**Get (or provide) an allergy test so we know what allergies to treat** We’ll meet you where you’re at in your treatment plan. We’re happy to work with existing allergy test results or mail you one to complete at home. \\n**We deliver oral treatment to your doorstep** Get your prescribed medication in three-month shipments and 24/7 doctor support along the way. Read about everything that’s included. \\n**Live an allergy-free life** Move off of antihistamines. Forget you have allergies. We\\'re committed to fixing the root cause of your symptoms so you’re never hindered by itchy eyes, hives, congestion, and more.\\n#### Can you treat multiple allergies at once?\\nYes! Our providers are able to treat your pet, pollen, dust, and mold allergies all at once. This is the standard of care across allergists in the US and the world. While some providers only treat 1 or 2 allergens, most clinicians feel this won\\'t solve all of your symptoms. We treat all allergy triggers across the United States. We do not currently treat food allergies.\\n#### Why the name Wyndly?\\nBreath is life. Anyone who has experienced allergies knows how debilitating it is to worry about your triggers and not being able to breathe. Here at Wyndly, we want you to be able to take in the full breath of life, to live the way you want without itching, sneezing, watery eyes, hives, congestion, or a poor night’s sleep.

Let\\'s clear things up.\\n Read more questions ⟨3⟩\\n#### Will this work for me?\\nIf you’re suffering from environmental allergens, we’re optimistic about our chances of being able to treat you. We\\'ve worked with patients with severe allergies and allergic reactions. We are limited by some pre-existing conditions and locations. You can take our candidacy quiz⟨21⟩ to learn if you pass preliminary screens and then book a consultation⟨22⟩ with a board-certified doctor.\\nIf you’ve met with a doctor and are prescribed treatment and don’t see relief in three months, we offer a money-back guarantee⟨23⟩. \\n#### What’s the science behind Wyndly?\\nSublingual immunotherapy ⟨24⟩is a form of allergy exposure therapy or desensitization. By safely exposing your immune system to small doses of what you are allergic to, over time, your body becomes tolerant to your allergy triggers. This leads to a decrease in your allergy symptoms and can provide lifelong allergy relief. This also lets you avoid the negative side effects of allergy pills and sprays.\\nWhile antihistamines and nasal sprays can help manage symptoms when using the medications, allergy immunotherapy is the only scientifically proven method of creating long-term changes to your immune system to decrease symptoms. Wyndly makes lifelong allergy relief available to everyone through telemedicine and personalized allergy treatment plans.\\nThe American Academy of Otolaryngology⟨25⟩ considers sublingual immunotherapy allergy drops capable of \"help[ing] patients experience relief from allergy symptoms and improve their overall quality of life.\"\\nIn 2003, and again in 2010, the Cochrane Review⟨26⟩, an independent health care researcher, concluded in a systematic review of the available research that sublingual allergy immunotherapy is both effective and safe.\\n#### What’s the Wyndly process like from start to finish?\\nTo start the Wyndly process, you’ll meet with a board-certified doctor to determine if Wyndly is a fit for you and set up an allergy consult.**Start with a consult.**\\nYou’ll speak with a board-certified doctor to determine your treatment plan. As doctors, we believe that the best medical care comes from collaboration between provider and patient as you start treatment. \\n**Get (or provide) an allergy test so we know what allergies to treat** We’ll meet you where you’re at in your treatment plan. We’re happy to work with existing allergy test results or mail you one to complete at home. \\n**We deliver oral treatment to your doorstep** Get your prescribed medication in three-month shipments and 24/7 doctor support along the way. Read about everything that’s included. \\n**Live an allergy-free life** Move off of antihistamines. Forget you have allergies. We\\'re committed to fixing the root cause of your symptoms so you’re never hindered by itchy eyes, hives, congestion, and more.\\n#### Can you treat multiple allergies at once?\\nYes! Our providers are able to treat your pet, pollen, dust, and mold allergies all at once. This is the standard of care across allergists in the US and the world. While some providers only treat 1 or 2 allergens, most clinicians feel this won\\'t solve all of your symptoms. We treat all allergy triggers across the United States. We do not currently treat food allergies.\\n#### Why the name Wyndly?\\nBreath is life. Anyone who has experienced allergies knows how debilitating it is to worry about your triggers and not being able to breathe. Here at Wyndly, we want you to be able to take in the full breath of life, to live the way you want without itching, sneezing, watery eyes, hives, congestion, or a poor night’s sleep. We want you out in the world breathing deep and feeling the _wind_ through you nose, throat, chest. \\nAnd, to be frank, we were started by a team of board-certified doctors, not marketers, and probably could have picked a better name. \\n Read more questions ⟨3⟩\\n![Wyndly logo⟨27⟩]\\n##  Better treatment.

  "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Wyndly**\n\n**Mission**: \"Life's better without allergies.\"\n\nWyndly is revolutionizing the way allergies are treated in the United States. Founded in 2020 and based in New York, this telehealth platform focuses on providing patients with a personalized and convenient approach to allergy care. By utilizing sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), Wyndly trains patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers, offering a potential pathway to lifelong relief.\n\n**The Problem and the Solution**: \n\nWith 60 million Americans suffering from allergies—this number expected to double—there’s a growing demand for effective, hassle-free care. Many allergy sufferers are tired of relying on pills and sprays, and that’s where Wyndly steps in. Instead of the traditional, uncomfortable allergy shots, it provides a tailored treatment plan accessible from the comfort of home. This innovative method involves an initial virtual consultation, followed by a doctor-prescribed sublingual treatment that is delivered straight to patients' doors.\n\n**The Wyndly Experience**: \n\n1. **Consultation**: Patients start their journey with a virtual meeting with a board-certified physician, discussing their unique medical history and designing a personalized treatment strategy.\n2. **Treatment Delivery**: If deemed a candidate, patients engage in allergy testing to identify specific triggers, allowing doctors to craft a customized plan.\n3. **Ongoing Support**: Patients receive regular online check-ins and 24/7 access to medical support, ensuring they never feel alone in their treatment journey.\n4. **Allergy Freedom**: The goal is simple: to help patients live allergy-free, diminishing their dependence on antihistamines and other short-term solutions.\n\n**Company Values**: \n\nWyndly operates under four core values:\n- **Compassion**: Being there for patients with genuine care and understanding.\n- **Focus**: Mastering a few key areas rather than spreading thin.\n- **Courage**: Embracing challenges as opportunities to learn and grow.\n- **Progress**: Striving for continuous improvement in patient care.\n\n**Team**: \n\nThe company was co-founded by Dr. Manan Shah, a leading ENT physician specializing in telehealth, and Aakash Shah, who has a background in growth engineering at successful tech firms. They are backed by Y Combinator, alongside a robust team of 10 employees and various esteemed investors.\n\nWith its innovative model and an eye toward expanding beyond just allergies to other chronic conditions such as asthma and sleep apnea, Wyndly aims not only to provide effective allergy care but also to set new standards across the healthcare industry. \n\nIn short, Wyndly is about more than just medication—it's about fostering a supportive, personalized healthcare experience that opens the door to an allergy-free life.
