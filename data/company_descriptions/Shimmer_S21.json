We help you achieve improvements across various domains of your life, specifically addressing ADHD-related challenges. Our solution-focused, health coaching model emphasizes observable actions and behaviors, not just adding more theory or knowledge. Shimmer’s ADHD Coaching Program targets key dimensions essential for individuals with ADHD, based on our Shimmer ADHD Mastery Framework:- **Time:** Handling the past, present, and future effectively- **Done:** Starting, following through, and finishing tasks- **Pause:** Managing emotions and maintaining balanceOur evidence-based coaching program was designed by leading ADHD experts from NYU, Mount Sinai, and other top academic and coaching institutions. Our ADHD coaches collaborate with you to co-design a personalized plan to help you reach your goals. Together, you\\'ll experiment with strategies weekly, building a routine tailored to your needs.Each coach-member partnership begins with vision and goal setting, followed by a weekly cycle of experimentation and reflection. This process includes:- Weekly coaching sessions with real-human guidance and accountability- Guidance through the experimentation and reflection process to make changes in your life- Access to community features and events like daily body doubling sessions- Accountability tools built for ADHD brains\\u200d\\nWhat kind of time commitment do I have to make?\\nShimmer is designed to fit into your schedule — not the other way around. Your coach will design and schedule your tasks based on what\\'s realistic for you and can make changes during the week to accommodate your busy life.\\nCan I use my HSA, FSA or HRA to expense Shimmer?\\nYes you can! We are HSA/FSA/HRA-eligible. This means if you have a **Health Savings Account** , **Flexible Savings Account** , or **Health Reimbursement Arrangement** with your employer, you can pay for Shimmer using your card from one of these accounts. You can also submit our invoices for reimbursement to your provider if you forget to use the card provided by them for your subscription.Some providers may require you to submit a letter of necessity for this expense, please reach out to us at support@shimmer.care if you need any help with getting your subscription reimbursed by your HSA/FSA/HRA provider!\\nHow do I become a Shimmer ADHD Coach?\\nWe’re so glad you’re interested! We’re looking for licensed coaches (ICF or NBHWC preferred) specializing in ADHD. Shimmer coaches are passionate to help others, kind & empathetic, and most of us are living with ADHD ourselves. If you\\'re interested in joining the coaching team, [check out this page](https://shimmer.care/</coaches>), fill out the application, and we\\'ll reach out if it good fit!\\nCan I reschedule or cancel a session?\\nWe understand that life doesn\\'t always go according to plan. Shimmer members can cancel or reschedule a coaching video call without penalty 24 hours in advance. If cancellation is within 24 hours, the session will be forfeited for the week. Thank you for your understanding!\\nDo you offer couples coaching or family coaching?\\nAt this time, Shimmer only offers 1:1 individual coaching, but we are looking to expand our services in the future!\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fd53aee74de0344a4307aad/640a38680acb6da41127a461_Exit%20Icon.svg)\\n## Get our free ADHD Starter Kit delivered to your email.\\nEnter your email to download the free PDF of our ADHD Starter Pack\\nDone! 🎉 The ADHD Starter Kit has been sent!

  "generated_description": "**Shimmer: A Bright New Approach to ADHD Coaching**\n\nFounded in 2021 and now part of Y Combinator's Batch S21, Shimmer is redefining how people tackle ADHD through personalized, one-on-one coaching. Located in the heart of San Francisco and fueled by a dedicated team of nine professionals — including ADHD coaches, psychiatrists, engineers, and psychologists — Shimmer aims to break free from the conventional methods of ADHD management. Instead of just apps and to-do lists, they focus on real interactions and scientifically-backed techniques to instigate meaningful change.\n\n### Core Mission\nShimmer’s mission is simple yet compelling: to provide 1:1 ADHD coaching that’s 5-10 times more affordable than traditional options. They’ve engineered a coaching program that allows you to partner with expert coaches who will collaboratively design a tailored plan to help you achieve your personal goals. \n\n### How It Works\nHere's the gist of it: Shimmer isn’t about throwing a bunch of strategies at you hoping something sticks. You’ll meet weekly with your coach to explore and experiment with action-oriented strategies specifically designed for you. This continuous loop of experimentation and feedback is supported by a wealth of resources, including tools crafted for productivity and learning modules rooted in the latest ADHD research from institutions like NYU and UC Berkeley.\n\n### Pricing and Structure\nShimmer’s pricing is refreshingly accessible. While most coaching services run north of $500 a month, Shimmer offers their expertise for just $230 per month, with an enticing 25% off your first month. This plan includes weekly sessions, a comprehensive assessment, and access to a suite of resources, all aimed at developing sustainable habits that lead to real-life improvements.\n\n### Community and Support\nBuilding a community around ADHD is another aspect that sets Shimmer apart. Members are encouraged to share experiences, support one another, and participate in group activities like “body doubling” sessions, which can help with focus and follow-through.\n\n### Testimonials\nFeedback from Shimmer's users speaks volumes. Members appreciate the personalized support, noting that the coaching is tailored to their unique needs and situations. Many report feeling empowered, more in control of their lives, and excited about the prospects of personal growth.\n\n### In Closing\nIf you're looking for a coaching platform that merges empathy with expert strategies, while also making it financially viable, Shimmer could be the answer you've been searching for. Their commitment to understanding ADHD not only from a theoretical perspective but from true life experience makes them a standout choice in the mental health tech landscape.\n\nCheck them out here: [Shimmer](https://shimmer.care) and see how you can take control of your ADHD with actionable insights and caring support."
