InQuery helps you understand the complete picture of a patient\\'s medical history by surfacing key details and summarizing key narratives tucked away in stacks of nurse notes, diagnostics reports, and other medical records.\\nHow does InQuery work? \\nInQuery is a simple platform that allows users to upload PDFs of claim files they\\'re working on and get back rich summaries with citations back to the original source for your review. By highlighting key details from medical evaluations, injury descriptions, state filings, and legal reports, InQuery can help claims professionals make better decisions about their claims in a fraction of the time.\\nHow does InQuery protect my data? Will you fill out my CISO\\'s security questionnaire? \\nYes! InQuery was built with security in mind from day one. We are currently in the middle of a formal audit to obtain SOC2 Type I, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 compliance. In the meantime, we keep all of our customers\\' data in separate databases, encyrpt all data in-transit and at rest, and strip PII from documents before making calls to exteernal APIs, amongst other security measures. Feel free to ask us about it and we can send you a full abstract of our security philosophies!\\nHow is InQuery different from ChatGPT and other AI tools? \\nInQuery has invested heavily in our PDF parsing and document understanding capabilities to allow you to upload massive documents while still getting fast, accurate, annotated responses. Our true differentiator, though, is our ability to deeply understand the case the context to surface rich and relevant details that could make or break a case.\\nMy team is new to AI- is InQuery the right tool for me? \\nYes! InQuery was designed to be incredibly easy to use. Our no-code platform is designed to be as easy as working with a close assistant, so your team can get value as soon as they log into the platform.\\nCan your generative AI tool be used in compliance with our policy prohibiting AI-generated medical reports or decisions? \\nYes, our generative AI tool is designed to align with policies like yours while enhancing efficiency and accuracy in the research process. Here\\'s how:Purpose-Built for Research, Not Report CreationOur AI does not generate medical opinions, diagnoses, or draft any part of an IME or peer review report. Instead, it acts as a cited case research assistant, helping you quickly locate and synthesize relevant legal precedents, clinical guidelines, or medical literature.We\\'ve designed the product to surface direct evidence from documents, pointing examiners in the right direction. Our responses are not intended to be copied and pasted directly into reports, which is why we\\'ve included robust search functionality and are working on improving how evidence is cited in summaries.No Exposure of Sensitive Patient DataThe tool is explicitly designed not to process protected health information (PHI). It operates on anonymized queries (e.g., \"Find recent case law on spinal injury disability thresholds\") and returns citations with summaries, ensuring no patient-specific data is shared with AI vendors or third parties.HIPAA-Compliant InfrastructureOur platform adheres to stringent privacy standards, including HIPAA, and employs enterprise-grade encryption, access controls, and audit trails. User interactions with the tool are siloed from public AI models, eliminating risks of data leakage.You Retain Full Responsibility and ControlThe AI serves only to accelerate research, much like a digital library. All conclusions, observations, and decisions in your report are yours alone, grounded in your professional judgment and the evidence you review directly (e.g., patient records, diagnostic tests).We understand and respect the stance some companies are taking on AI usage, and we take these concerns very seriously. At the same time, we believe that opinions on AI usage will evolve with the landscape and with education. The quality and robustness of AI tools are improving rapidly, and we believe that not leveraging AI responsibly in the coming years will be akin to not using the internet in the past decade.It\\'s our responsibility to engage in these conversations and ensure we deliver this technology to the market in a way that aligns with the highest standards of ethics, privacy, and professional integrity.By streamlining time-consuming legal and medical research, our tool empowers you to focus on what matters most: delivering accurate, defensible, and patient-centric conclusions.Still have concerns?
