  "description": "Relevium Medical is developing an injectable gel for knee osteoarthritis. Approximately half the population will be diagnosed with this pain and progressive disease.\r\nRight now, patients have to undergo not only repeat injections to control their pain, but also have to take strong oral medications. Because the disease is progressive and only gets worse over time, many patients end up on highly addictive, high-dose opioids. \r\nTo date, we have secured $3.7 million in non dilutive funding and completed preclinical testing. We demonstrated that our drug is safe, selectively blocks nerves that transmit pain, and provides pain relief that lasts four times as long. \r\nInsurance currently pays $770 per six-monthly treatment for knee osteoarthritis. With 5 million patients in the US, this represents a $7.7 Bn market opportunity.\r\nThis platform biotherapeutic can also be used to treat other joints affects by osteoarthritis such as the hip and ankle, where the same problems exist in treatment care.",

  "generated_description": "**Relevium Medical: Pioneering Pain Relief in Osteoarthritis**\n\nFounded in 2019 and nestled in Galway, Ireland, Relevium Medical is pushing the boundaries of biopharmaceuticals. The company has a focused mission: to develop an injectable gel that addresses the debilitating pain of knee osteoarthritis—a condition that approximately half the population faces at some point. \n\nOsteoarthritis is a progressive disease, and current treatment regimes often involve not just frequent injections but also reliance on strong oral medications. This paradigm frequently leads patients to highly addictive opioids as they seek relief. Relevium's innovative therapy aims to disrupt this pattern by offering a safer, more effective alternative. Their injectable gel has completed preclinical testing, boasting a safety profile that selectively blocks pain-transmitting nerves and delivers pain relief capable of lasting four times longer than conventional options.\n\nFinancially, Relevium has secured $3.7 million in non-dilutive funding, illustrating confidence in their ambitious plans. In a landscape where the US market alone for knee osteoarthritis treatments is pegged at a staggering $7.7 billion, the company’s prospects are bright. Their focus doesn’t end with the knee; they're also exploring applications for other joints like the hip and ankle, where similar challenges exist.\n\nPart of the Y Combinator Batch S22, Relevium is a small team of five, but their vision is grand. They are leveraging natural biopolymers combined with pharmacologically active agents, crafting a robust pipeline of hydrogel products tailored for chronic pain. Their approach underscores a commitment to innovation and excellence, aiming to enhance patient outcomes significantly.\n\nWith a solid foundation in science and a market ripe for disruption, Relevium Medical is on a mission to transform the lives of chronic pain sufferers, one injection at a time. For more insights into their revolutionary journey or the science behind their product, check out their [website](https://relevium-medical.com/)."
