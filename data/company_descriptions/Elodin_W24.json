We allow you to easily create custom physics simulations, all running on the GPU. We also include a suite of simulations and algorithms to make building your simulation turn-key. Once you've built out your simulation, you can leverage our cloud platform to run massive numbers of tests in the cloud.\\nWhat industries can benefit from using Elodin?\\nElodin is ideal for aerospace companies, research institutions, robotics developers, and educational institutions seeking to innovate and accelerate their aerospace projects. Elodin is also useful for anyone else who needs a fast, GPU-accelerated simulation pipeline. If you have a different use case, feel free to reach out to us, and we can work on how you can use Elodin.\\nWhat programming languages or skills are required to use Elodin?\\nElodin currently allows you to write physics simulations in Rust or Python. The software you are testing with our simulations can be written in any language you want. We plan on adding support for more languages in the future, if you have a specific language request please reach out.\\nCan I integrate Elodin with my existing workflow or tools?\\nYes, Elodin is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing workflows and tools. Our goal is to allow incremental adoption of Elodin, use us for any piece of your simulation stack no matter how big or small.\\nHow secure is Elodin’s platform?\\nSecurity is a top priority for Elodin. We employ industry-standard security measures, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data.\\nIs Elodin suitable for beginners in aerospace engineering?\\nYes, Elodin is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to engineers of all skill levels. Beginners can use Elodin’s intuitive interface and extensive documentation to get started with ease.\\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65b83ac4cf86c236d2b91487/65bacca1717fa2751d674cef_Logo.svg)](https://elodin.systems/</>)\\nJoin our newsletter to stay updated on what we're working on.\\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and consent to receive updates from our company.\\nYou're good to go\\nPlease try again.\\n[Home](https://elodin.systems/</>)[Aleph - Flight Computer](https://elodin.systems/</products/aleph>)[Company](https://elodin.systems/</company>)[Github](https://elodin.systems/<https:/github.com/elodin-sys/elodin>)[Docs](https://elodin.systems/<https:/docs.elodin.systems/>)[Video Demos](https://elodin.systems/</video-demos>)Contact\\n[Join our Discord](https://elodin.systems/<https:/elodin.app/discord>)[Blog](https://elodin.systems/</blog>)\\n[Instagram](https://elodin.systems/<https:/www.instagram.com/elodin.systems/>)[Twitter](https://elodin.systems/<https:/twitter.com/Elodinsystems>)[Linkedin](https://elodin.systems/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/elodin-systems-inc/>)[Youtube](https://elodin.systems/<https:/www.youtube.com/@elodin-sys>)\\n© 2024 Elodin Systems.
