We help businesses collect both recurring and one-off payments, without the chasing, stress or expensive fees.\r\n\nWeâre building a global bank payment network that lets people make and collect payments straight from their bank account, across multiple countries and currencies. 75,000+ businesses around the world trust us to power their payments. We enable them to collect payments from 30+ countries, processing over $30 billion each year.\r\n\nOur suite of add-on products are helping businesses face their payment challenges head on.
