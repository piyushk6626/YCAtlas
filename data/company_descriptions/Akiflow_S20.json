I can easily manage my to-do items, schedule them or leave them in the Someday bucket if they are not tied to a deadline. I love that I can see my calendar and my to-do items on one screen so I can also evaluate how many calls I can add to my day based on the items in my backlog. It also integrates with Slack perfectly, so I can save items and send them to my inbox instead of relying on Slack reminders. Well done. \\n![Jonathan Leung](https://akiflow.com/images/app/reviews/jonathan_leung_avatar.png)\\nJonathan Leung \\nI have used Asana, Click Up, Monday and Notion, and of all the tools, Akiflow is the best for me right now. And that\\'s because of two main things. One is the integration between calendar and tasks being super seamless and other is because of the freaking keyboard shortcuts. There\\'s a keyboard shortcut for everything, and I love that. So that makes it very easy to use.

I can easily manage my to-do items, schedule them or leave them in the Someday bucket if they are not tied to a deadline. I love that I can see my calendar and my to-do items on one screen so I can also evaluate how many calls I can add to my day based on the items in my backlog. It also integrates with Slack perfectly, so I can save items and send them to my inbox instead of relying on Slack reminders. Well done. \\n![Jonathan Leung⟨71⟩]\\nJonathan Leung \\nI have used Asana, Click Up, Monday and Notion, and of all the tools, Akiflow is the best for me right now. And that\\'s because of two main things. One is the integration between calendar and tasks being super seamless and other is because of the freaking keyboard shortcuts. There\\'s a keyboard shortcut for everything, and I love that. So that makes it very easy to use. Thank you so much, Akiflow team, for making this incredible piece of software. \\n![Celina Mukarker⟨72⟩]\\nCelina Mukarker \\nAkiflow is the only app that broke my long #habit of handwriting #tasks and #deadlines!
