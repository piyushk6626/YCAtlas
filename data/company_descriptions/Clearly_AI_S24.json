  "generated_description": "**Clearly AI: A Quick Overview**\n\n**Company**: Clearly AI  \n**Founded**: August 2024  \n**Location**: Seattle, WA  \n**Team Size**: 2 people  \n**Investors**: Backed by Y Combinator (Batch S24)\n\n**Mission**: Automate security and privacy reviews to empower organizations to focus on what really matters.\n\n### The Problem and Solution\n\nClearly AI was born out of experience—founders Emily and Joe, both seasoned engineers, realized the challenges faced in conducting security and privacy reviews. After working on complex projects at Amazon and Moveworks, they’ve set out to create a tool that automates these painstaking processes. Instead of taking days, users can complete security reviews in mere minutes.\n\n### What They Offer\n\nClearly AI delivers tailored AI solutions aimed at streamlining security and privacy processes in three main areas:\n\n1. **Security Reviews**: Automating the assessment of software to ensure compliance with industry best practices and internal policies.\n2. **Privacy Reviews**: Conducting assessments to verify that all new features and products meet relevant privacy regulations.\n3. **Vendor Risk Assessments**: Evaluating third-party vendors for their compliance with security standards, helping teams make informed decisions.\n\n### The Team\n\n- **Emily** (CEO): With a rich background at Moveworks and Amazon, where she focused on AI security for Alexa, Emily leads the mission to safeguard customer privacy and security.\n- **Joe** (CTO): Joe’s experience includes building software at Amazon and critical roles in various security reviews. \n\n### Quick Wins\n\nSince launching, Clearly AI quickly secured two paid pilot projects within the first week, including collaboration with a major electric vehicle manufacturer. \n\n### Getting Involved\n\nIf you’re interested in automating your security and privacy reviews, don’t hesitate to check out their [website](https://clearly-ai.com) or join their waitlist. Emily and Joe promise a solution built by security engineers for security engineers, simplifying the complexities of compliance while enhancing efficiency.\n\nIn essence, Clearly AI isn’t just another tech startup; it’s the answer to a nagging problem in a world increasingly aware of security and privacy concerns."
