This is because it relies on a permanent internet connection to the charger and also on the user’s smartphone having a mobile network signal. That fact drives the cost of hardware, installations and operations and also often leads to bad user experience when no network coverage is available.\\nAt HeyCharge we are dedicated to build the best in class user experience based on a full digital process. No RFID cards - just the HeyCharge app enables simple usage and provides full cost transparency.\\n[Learn more![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/634fb9b7df9f127e18b93cad_link%20arrow.svg)](https://heycharge.com/<#>)\\n## Integrated billing\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/634fa436f22c3bcd831ec8f4_Integrated%20billing.png)\\nUsing the integrated HeyCharge billing functionality you can significantly reduce the operations efforts of your facility managers and asset managers. Individual energy consumption is invoiced via the HeyCharge backend directly to the user. Access control to selected chargers can be granted within seconds. ia the HeyCharge management portal. You receive the exact overview of the consumed energy amount of the individual users. The recorded energy consumption can be settled directly with the user for a defined period.\\n[Learn more![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/634fb9b7df9f127e18b93cad_link%20arrow.svg)](https://heycharge.com/<#>)\\n## integrated load Management \\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/645f4c4c3b5356316885fa4c_Bildschirmfoto%202023-05-13%20um%2009.37.04.png)\\nOur integrated load management feature becomes essential when demand for EV charging grows faster than the power capacity within a building. As soon as a certain power limit is reached, the HeyCharge charging network will optimizes itself and will find the perfect balance for every power demand situation.\\nThe communication between the chargers is based on a reliable wireless ZigBee communication and integrates the load management feature itself directly on the HeyCharge wallbox. This eliminates the need for external management hardware and decreases installation complexity, efforts and costs. \\n[Learn more![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/634fb9b7df9f127e18b93cad_link%20arrow.svg)](https://heycharge.com/<#>)\\n## 100% white label solution to grow your EV-Charging business\\n[Charging Platform Provider](https://heycharge.com/<#w-tabs-1-data-w-pane-0>)[Charging Station Manufacturer](https://heycharge.com/<#w-tabs-1-data-w-pane-1>)[Charging Network Operator](https://heycharge.com/<#w-tabs-1-data-w-pane-2>)[Mobility Provider](https://heycharge.com/<#w-tabs-1-data-w-pane-3>)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/63a30134f946cc09c2c9bb12_Charging%20Platform%20Provider-2.png)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/63ac2387d31a0e97681e6845_Charging%20Station%20Manufactures-3.png)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/63aaaf62c753bdb3425fbf0e_Charging%20Network%20Operator-3.png)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/63aaaf62be456f3691c996da_Mobility%20Provider_3.png)\\n## End-2-End integration into 3rd party chargers, Apps and Platforms\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/639b66a904c4ff6f5174922b_100%25%20white%20label%20solution_1.jpg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/639b66a904c4ff6f5174922b_100%25%20white%20label%20solution_1.jpg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/639b66a931fa46401662cdb1_White%20label%20solution_2.jpg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/639b66a994b3a3ea02cf0a55_white%20label%20solution_3.jpg)\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611987cdf775d15cb10cab18/639b66a904c4ff6f5174922b_100%25%20white%20label%20solution_1.jpg)\\n**Hardware Development Kit (HDK)** Upgrading your EV charger to the next level?

This is because it relies on a permanent internet connection to the charger and also on the user’s smartphone having a mobile network signal. That fact drives the cost of hardware, installations and operations and also often leads to bad user experience when no network coverage is available.\\nAt HeyCharge we are dedicated to build the best in class user experience based on a full digital process.

  "generated_description": "HeyCharge is a Munich-based startup focused on creating low-cost, high-scale electric vehicle (EV) charging platforms for residential apartments and other locations. Founded in 2020, the company is part of Y Combinator's S21 batch and features a dedicated team of 17 professionals.\n\nThe crux of HeyCharge's innovation lies in its ultra-low-cost, plug-and-play EV chargers, which steer clear of expensive installations and complex setups. These chargers work without an internet connection, a game changer for areas with poor connectivity. By integrating seamlessly with third-party products through their API and SDK, HeyCharge makes EV charging not only accessible but also efficient for property operators, energy utilities, and mobility service providers.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Simplicity and Cost Efficiency:** Installation can be performed by any trained electrician, thus significantly reducing labor costs and installation times. This makes it easier for businesses to expand their charging networks rapidly.\n- **Low Connectivity Operation:** Unlike traditional systems, HeyCharge's technology does not rely on continuous internet access, ensuring that customers can charge reliably in areas where connectivity is unreliable.\n- **Integrated Billing and User Experience:** Their platform offers a user-friendly experience with integrated billing systems that streamline operations for facility managers. Users can access energy consumption details directly through the HeyCharge app, eliminating the need for physical cards.\n\n### Current Developments:\nHeyCharge has attracted attention for its impactful technology and partnerships. One notable collaboration includes a venture with Vonovia, Europe’s largest residential real estate company, aimed at delivering affordable EV charging solutions across Germany.\n\nIn a world rapidly shifting toward electrification, HeyCharge is poised to solve pressing challenges in the EV infrastructure space. By focusing on reliability, cost reduction, and ease of use, they are effectively addressing the pain points that have hindered broader adoption of EV charging solutions.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more, you can visit [HeyCharge's website](https://heycharge.com/)."
