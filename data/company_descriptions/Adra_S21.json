  "generated_description": "Adra is on a mission to transform dental clinic revenues by helping dentists discover more cavities—essentially finding more business for their practices. Launched in 2021 and backed by Y Combinator’s S21 batch, Adra is designed to enhance the accuracy and speed at which dental clinics analyze X-rays. With the expertise of its founders—a dentist who runs a clinic, a machine learning guru, and a bioscientist—Adra seeks to integrate advanced technology into everyday dental workflows.\n\nJust two months into their pilot with 20 dentists, Adra has already helped increase their monthly revenues by 12%. This is just the beginning; if every dentist employed Adra, they could collectively bill an additional $52 billion annually. Adra aims to capture a quarter of that market, creating a potential revenue stream of $13 billion.\n\nBased in Singapore with a compact team of 10, Adra is positioned at the intersection of healthcare and diagnostics. Their platform, Adravision, provides an array of solutions tailored for dentists, payers, clinics, and Dental Support Organizations (DSOs). Notable features include improved patient communication through visualizations that boost comprehension by four times, personalized reports that enhance patient retention, and automation that cuts charting time by an impressive 71%.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about Adra, their offerings, or even getting a demo, you can find them at [Adra's website](https://www.adra.ai).\n\nIn summary, Adra isn’t just selling software; they’re redefining the dental industry by enabling clinics to work smarter, serve patients better, and ultimately, boost their bottom line."
