  "description": "Upgraded helps retailers and carriers sell devices on subscription. Subscribers pay monthly and can upgrade anytime. Smartphones, laptops, tablets and more.\r\n\nCreating and managing these programs involves lender integrations, residual value management and building great software — resellers don’t know how to do this. \r\n\nUpgraded provides the infrastructure to launch immediately, keep customers loyal and cut replacement cycles in half. Device financing is a $541B market globally. US carrier financing grew from $13B to $51B in the last four years. \r\n\nUpgraded partners include Apple, Dixons/Elkjøp, MediaMarkt and Vodafone. Upgraded was founded in 2016. Investors include Y Combinator and GRIL Ventures.\r\n\nUpgraded is led by CEO John Erik Metcalf and CTO Ziad Sawalha.",

Citizens Pay Line of Credit Account offered by Citizens Bank, N.A.\\nUpgrade: Upgrade options for the next generation device vary by product and are disclosed in your Upgraded Program details. AppleCare+ must be purchased with your device to be eligible for upgrade options. Devices purchased without AppleCare+ will not be eligible for upgrades. If the applicable Upgraded Program made available by Upgraded permits, you may satisfy a portion of the remaining balance on your Citizens Pay Line of Credit by turning in the specified device to Upgraded and completing an upgrade for an eligible device after making the minimum number of required payments. The condition of the returned device and your eligibility for upgrade options will be determined solely by Upgraded and subject to available credit on your Line of Credit. If Upgraded determines that you are eligible for an upgrade then Upgraded will make a single payment on your Line of Credit in an amount that is equal to all remaining payments on the initial purchase on your Line of Credit, minus any deductions by Upgraded that are based on the condition of the eligible device, as disclosed to you by Upgraded. After Upgraded makes that payment, your account will be credited the amount of the payment and you are responsible for paying any other remaining balance on your Line of Credit. Citizens Pay has no involvement in or responsibility for assessing the condition of a device, your eligibility for an upgrade, determination or application of Upgraded’s upgrade policies, or the amount of the payment made by Upgraded, and any dispute related to any aspect of upgrade will be directed to Upgraded.

Citizens Pay Line of Credit Account offered by Citizens Bank, N.A.\\nUpgrade: Upgrade options for the next generation device vary by product and are disclosed in your Upgraded Program details. AppleCare+ must be purchased with your device to be eligible for upgrade options. Devices purchased without AppleCare+ will not be eligible for upgrades. If the applicable Upgraded Program made available by Upgraded permits, you may satisfy a portion of the remaining balance on your Citizens Pay Line of Credit by turning in the specified device to Upgraded and completing an upgrade for an eligible device after making the minimum number of required payments. The condition of the returned device and your eligibility for upgrade options will be determined solely by Upgraded and subject to available credit on your Line of Credit. If Upgraded determines that you are eligible for an upgrade then Upgraded will make a single payment on your Line of Credit in an amount that is equal to all remaining payments on the initial purchase on your Line of Credit, minus any deductions by Upgraded that are based on the condition of the eligible device, as disclosed to you by Upgraded. After Upgraded makes that payment, your account will be credited the amount of the payment and you are responsible for paying any other remaining balance on your Line of Credit. Citizens Pay has no involvement in or responsibility for assessing the condition of a device, your eligibility for an upgrade, determination or application of Upgraded’s upgrade policies, or the amount of the payment made by Upgraded, and any dispute related to any aspect of upgrade will be directed to Upgraded.

  "generated_description": "### Upgraded: A Subscription-Based Device Financing Solution\n\n**Company Overview**\nFounded in 2016 and based in San Francisco, Upgraded is a forward-thinking company aiming to revolutionize how consumers access technology through subscription-based financing. It helps retailers and carriers sell devices—like smartphones, laptops, and tablets—on a monthly subscription model, allowing subscribers to upgrade at any time.\n\n**The Problem**\nFor many retailers and carriers, creating and managing device subscription programs can be daunting. It involves complicated lender integrations, residual value management, and building robust software solutions—areas where many resellers lack expertise.\n\n**The Solution**\nUpgraded steps in to simplify this process. By providing the necessary infrastructure to launch and manage these programs efficiently, Upgraded not only helps keep customers loyal but also significantly reduces equipment replacement cycles. With a staggering $541 billion global market for device financing (and U.S. carrier financing growing from $13 billion to $51 billion in just four years), the potential for impact is enormous.\n\n**Key Offerings**\nUpgraded partners with well-known brands like Apple and Vodafone, allowing consumers to access top-tier products with ease. Customers can opt for financing options such as the **MacBook Upgrade Program**, offering low monthly payments and the flexibility to upgrade every two years—with AppleCare+ included for protection.\n\n**Customer-Centric Approach**\nThe essence of Upgraded lies in its customer support and ease of use. Users have praised the seamless order process, rapid delivery, and exceptional customer service, which is crucial for building trust in a subscription model. Early reviews highlight Upgraded's reliability and customer satisfaction, emphasizing its role as a game-changer for tech users.\n\n**Leadership and Growth**\nLed by CEO John Erik Metcalf and CTO Ziad Sawalha, the company is part of the Y Combinator Batch S16 and has a dedicated team of 13 employees. Backed by credible investors including Y Combinator and GRIL Ventures, Upgraded is strategically positioned for further growth and innovation in the fintech and retail sectors. \n\n**Conclusion**\nIn summary, Upgraded is tackling a significant challenge in the retail financing landscape, providing a much-needed solution to both consumers and sellers by making technology more accessible. It represents a promising shift towards a subscription model that could become the norm in device ownership.
