All study investigators are optimistic that the solution will be successful providing a much needed predictor of disease progression. It may therefore fill a significant diagnostic gap highly valued by patients, clinicians, and clinical researchers.” \\n![Dr. David J. Mikulis](https://darmiyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/David-Mikulis.webp)\\nDr. David J. MikulisMD, Professor and Director of the JDMI Functional Neuroimaging Research Lab\\n“Darmiyan’s AI, machine learning algorithm using unique MRI microscopic pixel analysis with macroscopic input has generated a very sensitive and specific five year prognosis for patients presenting with amnestic MCI. This technology has high test retest reliability and can be applied to any clinical grade MRI which is a very useful clinical tool to assist doctors advising patients with early memory complaints. In addition the BrainSee degeneration maps clearly show focal areas of degeneration. I believe this will be a widely used technology to assist doctors and patients navigating the difficult terrain of MCI.” \\n![Dr. Jamshid Ghajar](https://darmiyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Layer-2.png)\\nDr. Jamshid GhajarMD, PhD, FACS\\n“I am the PI of a longitudinal Brain Aging Study at HMRI for more than ten years. Our goal is to identify prodromal biomarkers and potential mechanisms of early dementia pathology of the Alzheimer type. Objective measures such as Darmiyan’s BrainSee that can predict cognitive decline are strongly needed to recognize and monitor potential therapies. I have interacted with Darmiyan for over two years, sharing some of the data from our Brain Aging study participants. I am excited by the potential for objective ways such as Darmiyan’s approach to predict cognitive decline, which can lead to better outcomes for patients and the healthcare system.” \\n![Dr. Michael G.

I believe this will be a widely used technology to assist doctors and patients navigating the difficult terrain of MCI.” \\n![Dr. Jamshid Ghajar⟨19⟩]\\nDr. Jamshid GhajarMD, PhD, FACS\\n## Investors\\n![soma⟨21⟩]\\n![arabangel⟨22⟩]\\n![SOMPO horizontal logo⟨23⟩]\\n![cabhi-logo⟨24⟩]\\n![1_sesxxo_47cgt3zcf5cthrw-5⟨25⟩]\\n![it-farm-logo⟨26⟩]\\n![Eisai_logo-1⟨27⟩]\\n![soma⟨21⟩]\\n![arabangel⟨22⟩]\\n![SOMPO horizontal logo⟨23⟩]\\n![cabhi-logo⟨24⟩]\\n![1_sesxxo_47cgt3zcf5cthrw-5⟨25⟩]\\n![it-farm-logo⟨26⟩]\\n![Eisai_logo-1⟨27⟩]\\n![soma⟨21⟩]\\n ![⟨2⟩ ](https://www.darmiyan.com/<http:/darmiyan.com>)\\n## Follow Us \\n Twitter ⟨28⟩  Linkedin ⟨29⟩\\n## Quick Links \\nProducts⟨4⟩\\nTeam⟨30⟩\\nTerms of Service⟨31⟩\\nPrivacy Policy⟨32⟩\\n## Contact us\\n ⟨33⟩\\ninfo@darmiyan.com \\nCopyright © 2025 Darmiyan | Powered by Darmiyan\\n![](https://pixel.wp.com/g.gif?v=ext&blog=171315345&post=41&tz=0&srv=darmiyan.com&hp=atomic&ac=2&amp=0&j=1%3A14.4-a.3&host=darmiyan.com&ref=&fcp=0&rand=0.859353427354429)\\n\" references_markdown=\"\\n\\n## References\\n\\n⟨1⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com>: Darmiyan\\n⟨2⟩ https://darmiyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image.png:  ![\\n⟨3⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com/>: Home\\n⟨4⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com/products/>: Products\\n⟨5⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com/contact/>:  contact us \\n⟨6⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/brainsee.ai/>: __Darmiyan's BrainSee Software Receives De Novo FDA Approval__\\n⟨7⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<http:/brainsee.ai>:  get started now \\n⟨8⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com/technology/>:  learn more \\n⟨9⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com/news/>: News\\n⟨10⟩ https://darmiyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fortune-logo-2016-840x485-2-e1656926472440.webp: ![\\n⟨11⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com/2022/06/23/darmiyan-ceo-was-selected-by-fortune-40-under-40/>:  Darmiyan CEO was selected by Fortune 40 under 40 \\n⟨12⟩ https://darmiyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Vector-Smart-Object-2-e1656761280753.png: ![\\n⟨13⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com/2022/06/14/brainsee-was-validated-by-third-party-investigators-in-the-us-canada/>:  BrainSee was validated by third-party investigators \\n⟨14⟩ https://darmiyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/download.png: ![\\n⟨15⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com/2022/05/23/fda-breakthrough-designation-granted-to-brainsee/>:  FDA breakthrough designation granted to BrainSee \\n⟨16⟩ https://darmiyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/eee.png: ![\\n⟨17⟩ https://www.darmiyan.com/<https:/darmiyan.com/2019/10/04/pharma-giant-eisai-led-a-6m-round-in-darmiyan/>:  Pharma giant Eisai led a $6M round in Darmiyan \\n⟨18⟩ https://darmiyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/David-Mikulis.webp: Dr. David J.
