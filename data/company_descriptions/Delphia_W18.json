  "generated_description": "## Delphia: Investing with Your Data, Not Your Money\n\nFounded in 2018, Delphia is a Toronto-based fintech company that's carving out a niche in the investment world by leveraging consumer data to shape innovative investment strategies. As part of Y Combinator’s Batch W18, Delphia positions itself at the intersection of technology and finance, believing that in today’s AI-driven landscape, data isn't just a byproduct—it’s the most critical asset.\n\n### Mission and Vision\nDelphia's mission revolves around **quantitative investment strategies** enhanced by consumer data. They strive to empower both individuals and institutional investors by transforming proprietary data into actionable investment insights. The underlying philosophy is that actively managing people's data can unlock new forms of wealth creation—a game-changer for those willing to participate.\n\n### What They Do\nAt its core, Delphia is about harnessing data to gain an edge in financial markets. This means using insights from various data sources—like credit card transactions and browsing habits—to inform investment decisions. Traditional hedge funds often leverage this type of consumer information to bolster their profits. Delphia aims to level the playing field, allowing everyday investors to benefit from their own data without needing to risk their capital directly.\n\n### Key Milestones\n- **2011-2018**: Delphia’s journey begins with its co-founders, who were already pioneering data-driven approaches to public opinion and predictive analytics long before they launched Delphia per se.\n- **2019**: Transitioned from offering predictions to Wall Street to becoming a registered Investment Advisor with the SEC.\n- **2021-2022**: Launched a market-neutral quant equity strategy, marking one of their best years in quantitative performance.\n- **2023**: Helped to establish Superset, a Data Trust for fair data compensation, and open-sourced their backtesting framework, InvestOS.\n\n### Looking Ahead\nDelphia isn't resting on its laurels. With a team of about 20 employees led by seasoned professionals, including CIO Jonathan Briggs, they're continually innovating. The firm has exciting plans, including:\n- **Tilt**: A new platform for trend-based investments.\n- **Backchannel**: A venture enabling experts to monetize their knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, Delphia has recently shifted its focus to professional investors after refining its core offerings.\n\n### Why Delphia Matters\nIn a world where your data is often considered a commodity, Delphia is pioneering a new path. They empower consumers by sharing profits from data insights, thus returning value to the very people generating the data. This approach not only democratizes access to investment strategies but promotes a fairer economic system. If you're curious to see where they go next, check them out at [Delphia.com](http://delphia.com).\n\nIn summary, Delphia exemplifies how innovative thinking in fintech can lead to tangible benefits for everyone—transforming personal data into wealth, not just numbers on a balance sheet."
