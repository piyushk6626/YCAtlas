  "description": "Four Growers was founded to provide healthy, affordable, local produce by reducing the production costs of greenhouse growers through robotics technology. We are positioning ourselves to be the automated solutions provider for greenhouse crop management. We are working closely with various greenhouse growers to develop a tomato harvesting robot. Our technology relies on two layers of protection, patents filed protecting the physical design of the robot and a proprietary algorithm that controls the robot's decision making. Our solution is not only capable of harvesting the tomatoes, but also of performing a quality check and packaging.",
