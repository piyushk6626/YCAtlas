You then click the button on the device, and your sample will be painlessly collected into it. The entire process takes less than 5 minutes.⟨15⟩\\n1.

Detailed step-by-step instructions of the sample collection process are included in each test kit.\\nHow is this different than traditional clinical labs?\\nIn traditional clinical labs, around 30 molecules are measured to assess your health, which looks at a narrow portion of your health. At iollo, we measure 500+ metabolite biomarkers for you in order to build a comprehensive picture of what is currently happening in your body.⟨15⟩\\nHow is this different than gut microbiome-testing?\\nA gut microbiome test looks at a person’s entire collection of microbes living inside their gut. As more research is being done in the field, it is becoming clearer that the metabolite biomarkers that these microbes produce that end up in the blood play a far more significant role in health than the gut microbiome composition alone. This means that to understand how your gut microbiome affects your health, it is essential to measure your blood metabolme.This is also the reason why only the metabolome can accurately predict your gut microbiome composition.⟨15⟩\\nIs my data secure?\\nData privacy is a top priority for us and we go above and beyond to protect your information. We are HIPAA compliant. We will never share your data without your consent, and will only do so for the advancement of research in health, metabolomics, and new personlized treatments. All of your protected health information (PHI) is encrypted and kept safe. Your information, results, and recommendations will never be shared with employers or insurance companies.⟨15⟩\\nWhat is metabolomics and my blood metabolome?\\nSugars like glucose, lipids like cholesterol, vitamins like vitamin B12, hormones like T3 and T4, are all metabolite biomarkers and we have so far identified 40,000+ of them in blood. The collection of all of these metabolite biomarkers are what is known as the blood metabolome.**\\u200d** While your genetic makeup gives you risk scores that can be used to indicate what might happen, your metabolome indicates what is happening in your body right now. Also, only 15% of age-related diseases are genetic. The other 85% are related to your blood metabolome.⟨15⟩\\nHow do you analyze results?\\nWe use the most advanced mass spectrometry technology to measure 500+ metabolite biomarkers from your blood sample and use state-of-the-art AI to create your personalized health report and recommendations.⟨15⟩\\nWhat can I do with my results?\\nYou can incorporate recommended lifestyle and nutritional changes, perform the recommended follow-up labs, schedule a telehealth consultation with a medical professional, and consult a medical professional to learn more about your results.⟨15⟩\\nHow is this different than DNA-testing?\\nYour genes do not change over your lifetime and while your genetic makeup gives you risk scores that can be used to indicate what might happen, your metabolome indicates what is happening in your body right now. Also, only 15% of age-related diseases are genetic. The other 85% are related to your blood metabolome.⟨15⟩\\niollo is for anyone who wants to be empowered with information and data about their blood metabolome. iollo tests are intended exclusively for wellness purposes. iollo cannot provide you with medical advice or diagnose you with any disease or condition.
