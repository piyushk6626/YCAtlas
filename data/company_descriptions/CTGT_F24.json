Due to the inefficiency of traditional AI, customers are often presented with long waits when creating a model. In addition, unexpected model behavior is hard to explain and resolve due to the \"black box\" nature of deep learning.\\n## CTGT’s solution\\nCTGT\\'s platform integrates seamlessly with existing workflows and yields 10x faster performance with accuracy comparable to or better than standard models. Inherent interpretability means customers can access a simple UI overlay that shows why the model is behaving unexpectedly and how to fix the issue. This means customers don\\'t have to contact support as often. \\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67160e0e6bd76875921fe9a7/67177bcd2c3255d5aca0db13_Frame%2012548.png)](https://www.ctgt.ai/<#>)\\nAI acceleration\\n## Deep Learning Performance, Where It Wasn\\'t Possible Before\\nA leader in the heavily regulated financial space processes massive amounts of tabular data for credit scoring.

  "generated_description": "**CTGT Overview**\n\nCTGT is an emerging player in the artificial intelligence landscape, founded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator's Batch F24. Nestled in San Francisco, this lean startup boasts a team of two, focused on building a cutting-edge AI platform that emphasizes efficiency and trustworthiness. \n\n**Mission and Vision**\n\nThe company's mission is to create an \"entirely new AI stack\" that serves as a safe, efficient alternative to the existing large language model (LLM) ecosystem. CTGT aims to empower Fortune 500 companies to deploy AI with greater confidence while preventing hallucinations and errors in real-time. The platform incorporates automated risk management and provides comprehensive audit trails, all backed by institutional-grade security controls. With AI adoption soaring, CTGT seeks to mitigate the costly mistakes and reputational damage associated with flawed AI implementations.\n\n**Key Achievements and Recognition**\n\nCTGT has quickly gained traction, attracting the attention of industry leaders and prominent investors.
