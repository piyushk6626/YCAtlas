  "generated_description": "Artemis Search is shaking things up in the world of search technology. Founded in 2021 and a proud member of Y Combinator’s Batch S22, this San Francisco-based startup has a mission that’s refreshingly straightforward: to create a search technology that actually finds what you’re looking for.\n\nWhile most search engines rely heavily on textual or semantic similarity to rank results, Artemis Search goes a step further. It employs special-purpose deep-learning models designed to evaluate how well search results align with the intent behind your queries. This innovative approach means that Artemis can not only return results that look similar to what you asked for but actually make sense in the context of your intent.\n\nCurrently, the company operates with a small but mighty team of three, led by Group Partner Dalton Caldwell. Artemis is tagged in the bustling sectors of artificial intelligence, machine learning, SaaS, B2B, and, of course, search. They are currently in beta and are focused on developing an AI-powered prospecting tool that combs the internet to identify ideal customers for businesses.\n\nIf you're curious to see what Artemis Search is all about, you can check out their website at [search-artemis.com](https://search-artemis.com/). Whether you're a business looking for smarter search solutions or someone interested in cutting-edge AI technologies, Artemis is a company to keep on your radar. They’re tackling one of the most persistent problems in tech — making search actually work. The future of search could be a lot brighter thanks to them."
