  "generated_description": "**Ever Loved: Simplifying Funeral Planning**\n\nEver Loved is a startup that aims to ease the process of funeral planning for families during one of their most difficult times. Founded in 2017 and based in San Francisco, it emerged from the Y Combinator S19 batch. The mission is straightforward: help families plan and fund funerals with less stress.\n\nOn average, funeral costs hover around $9,000, which can be an overwhelming burden. Ever Loved not only helps users raise these funds through community support but also streamlines the process of finding reliable vendors and products—all in one place. They provide essential tools for planning funerals and creating memorials, helping to connect family and friends online and offline.\n\nEver Loved’s offerings include:\n\n- **Funeral Planning**: A user-friendly interface to manage funeral arrangements.\n- **Memorial Websites**: A platform where families can create beautiful, personalized memorial sites to honor their loved ones.\n- **Vendor Listings**: Access to funeral homes, cemeteries, and hospice services to find the best options.\n- **Financial Assistance**: Features that allow families to set up fundraisers for funeral expenses.\n- **Guidance and Resources**: A wealth of articles and checklists to navigate the complexities of post-death tasks.\n\nThe team, which comprises just five individuals, focuses on supporting families by providing a comprehensive toolkit that allows them to focus on remembrance rather than logistics. Their approach encourages community involvement, facilitating shared memories and support during grief.\n\nIf you’re looking for experienced guidance in navigating funeral planning, or if you need to create an online space to commemorate someone special, check out Ever Loved at [everloved.com](https://everloved.com).
