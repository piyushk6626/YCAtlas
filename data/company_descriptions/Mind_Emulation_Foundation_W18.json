But, what makes you _you_ is not your body. It's your mind. \\nMind emulation enables your mind to continue to live on after your body has died. \\nOur mission is to fund and conduct scientific research in order to accelerate our path toward human mind emulation.\\n# Frequently Asked Questions\\n## What is mind emulation?\\nWhile we are far from understanding how the mind works, most philosophers and scientists agree that your mind is an emergent property of your body. In particular, your body’s **connectome**. Your connectome is the comprehensive network of neural connections in your brain and nervous system. Today your connectome is biological. But, because the mind is an emergent property of the connectome, if a biological connectome is emulated digitally, then it would have the same emergent property of the biological connectome. Mind emulation is the process of taking what makes you _you_ and emulating it digitally.\\n## What is connectomics?\\nConnectomics is a subfield of neuroscience focused on studying connectomes, the comprehensive network of neural connections in the brain and nervous system.\\nView fullsize\\nTED Talk by Sebastian Seung: I am my connectome\\nView fullsize\\nTED Talk by Jeff Lichtman: Connectomics\\nView fullsize\\nSaturated Reconstruction of a Volume of Neocortex\\n## How would you emulate a mind?\\nOne way to emulate a mind is to map the entire connectome. It is estimated that there are approximately 100 trillion connections in a human brain. All of these connections fit into a volume of approximately 1,000 cm³. In order to scan all of these connections you would need close to a nanometer resolution. In 2015, this was first done for a [small portion of brain](https://mindemulation.org/<http:/www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\\\\(15\\\\)00824-7>), but scaling it up to a whole human brain presents many challenges. Not only that, but once you have a comprehensive human connectome, there is still the challenge of emulating it digitally. There are two proposed approaches to mind emulation: destructive and non-destructive.\\n## What is the destructive approach?\\nDestructive scanning of the connectome has several steps: preservation, storage, scanning, and emulation. Upon biological death, the body undergoes [aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation](https://mindemulation.org/<https:/www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001122401500245X>). This process uses glutaraldehyde to stabilize the brain’s structure and vitrification to preserve the body so it can be stored at −135 °C indefinitely. The body could be stored until the cost to scan and emulate will have dropped substantially. At that point, the body will be partitioned such that it could be scanned with an electron microscope. These scans would be used to create a 3d reconstruction of the connectome and then emulated digitally. This digital emulation could then interact with the rest of the world using a simple text interface or a more sophisticated robotic avatar with digital representations of taste, sight, touch, smell, and sound.\\n## What is the non-destructive approach?\\nNon-destructive scanning of the connectome is similar to destructive scanning but instead the scanning is done in a living being. The best known approach to this problem is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The highest resolution commercially available MRI machines are only [sub-millimeter](https://mindemulation.org/<https:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4520483/>) which is tens of thousands of times worse than the nanometer resolution necessary. Fortunately, MRI technology is advancing rapidly and in 2017 has reached the [nanoscale level](https://mindemulation.org/<https:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5423496/>).\\n## When will mind emulation be possible?\\nIt is difficult to predict when mind emulation will be available. There are three reasons to be optimistic. \\nFirst, many of the fundamental problems have been solved at very small scales. It is much more tractable to scale up a concept proven at a small scale than it is to come up with a novel breakthrough discovery.\\nSecond, the technology already exists today to preserve and store your connectome indefinitely. Even if it takes hundreds of years for the rest of the process to be available, everyone living today could still benefit if they were preserved upon biological death. \\nAnd lastly, things that improve exponentially get better really fast. If you plot the largest synapse-resolution connectomes mapped over time using a logarithmic scale, a reasonable estimate for the first human brain being mapped would in 2084.\\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58be00c33e00be1c14ac7299/1585716179049-451PSLXERNVSDAOQIAIG/image-asset.png)\\n## How will the foundation help?\\nThe Mind Emulation Foundation will fund and conduct scientific research in order to accelerate our path toward human mind emulation.\\n# Mind Emulation Manifesto\\nSign the manifesto below if you publicly support the following:\\n  1.

  "generated_description": "**Mind Emulation Foundation: A Brief Overview**\n\nThe **Mind Emulation Foundation** is an ambitious endeavor operating at the intersection of neuroscience and technology. Its primary mission is to research and develop the methods needed to emulate human minds digitally, enabling continuity of consciousness even after biological death. This goal is based on the profound idea that our essence—the \"you\" that you feel—stems from the intricate network of neural connections in your brain, known as the connectome.\n\n### What They Do\nThe foundation is invested in various avenues of research surrounding mind emulation, primarily focusing on understanding and mapping the human connectome. This involves:\n\n1. **Defining Mind Emulation**: It refers to the process of digitizing your connectome, allowing your thoughts and personality to potentially exist outside your biological body.\n  \n2. **Exploring Connectomics**: This subfield of neuroscience aims to uncover the complexities of the neural connections that make up the human brain.\n\n3. **Investigating Scanning Techniques**: The foundation is looking into two primary methods of scanning the connectome:\n   - **Destructive Scanning**: After biological death, the brain would be preserved and scanned at a nanometer resolution to reconstruct its connectome.\n   - **Non-Destructive Scanning**: This approach seeks to map the connectome while a person is alive, with advancements in MRI technology paving the way.\n\n4. **Establishing a Timeline**: While the precise timeline for implementing mind emulation is uncertain, some predictions suggest that our first human brain model could emerge around 2084, given the accelerated pace of technology.\n\n5. **Community Engagement**: Through initiatives like the Mind Emulation Manifesto, the foundation fosters public discourse on the implications of mind emulation, advocating for its democratization and accessibility.\n\n### The Future Outlook\nWith significant hurdles ahead, the Mind Emulation Foundation holds a cautiously optimistic outlook. They are not merely waiting for technological advancements; they actively contribute to research efforts. Supported by an ethos of scientific inquiry and accessibility, the foundation aims to pave the way towards a future where mind emulation becomes a reality, offering a second chance at existence.\n\nFor those interested in supporting or learning more, you can explore their offerings and get involved through their [official website](https://mindemulation.org/). Whether through donations or joining the conversation, there are numerous ways to support this thought-provoking mission.\n\nIn summary, the Mind Emulation Foundation is a cutting-edge organization dedicated to one of humanity's most profound pursuits: understanding and preserving our consciousness."
