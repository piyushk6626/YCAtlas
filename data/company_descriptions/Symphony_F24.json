They emphasize a practical and engaging approach: “Stop practicing on your customers. Simulate real-world scenarios with the push of a button.”\n\n**Website**: You can learn more or get in touch with them via their website at [getsymphony.co](https://getsymphony.co).\n\nIn short, Symphony is tackling an age-old problem in employee training with an innovative tech-driven solution.
