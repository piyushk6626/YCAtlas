Canix has allowed us to send orders that are easily received by our customers.\"\\nBrittney Woody\\nDirector of Warehouse Operations\\nEuphoria Wellness\\n“We’ve been fortunate to be an early adopter of Canix. Seeing the application and software flourish in that time has been great to observe as a customer and has saved Ladybug Farms and our group 1000’s of hours and an immense amount of compliance related costs with the mobile and desktop system. Would highly recommend.”\\nJake B.\\nPresident and COO\\nLadybug Farms\\n“Great product for inventory management. Canix is an excellent tool when it comes to keeping track of inventory. It also excels at plant and tag tracking as well. It solves the issue of inventory communication. All people in our Canix profile can see when we are low on a product to purchase more.”\\nSam Dinkel\\nCultivation Tech\\nGreen Dragon Cannabis Company LLC\\n“Very easy to use and learn. I like that Canix is very user-friendly and intuitive. It is also easy to fix an error should you make one. Canix is helping us bridge the gap between the accounting department and State Regs by giving reports that are actually useful to the accountants.”\\nNatalie Cummings\\nController\\nCustom Carts of Sarasota, LLC\\n“We have used Canix at our production facility for just over a year and have to say we love it. Canix is easy to use and speeds up a lot of daily tasks. There is also great support when you have a question or need assistance. Our sales department loves it and would highly recommend it to any other licensed and regulated production facility.”\\nAlex C.\\nSales Director\\n“Perfect Seed to Sale software. Detailed and surprisingly intuitive and easy to use. My team and I use it daily to assist with state mandated Metrc. Very responsive and helpful support staff is a definitely a welcome change from other services. Perfect to use alongside Metrc. It is very intuitive and easy to use. The reporting aspects are definitely helpful.”\\nMichael R.\\nPresident / CEO\\n“I have run cannabis facilities in multiple states. [Canix is] way easier to navigate than Metrc and more reliable in my opinion. The layout is excellent. I’ve used three different software programs to track products in the cannabis industry for 10 years. Tacking and Inventory are the two best things Canix has helped with.”\\nEric Gallagher\\nNaturae Oils\\n“The interface is very easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. For those that are familiar with just working with METRC, you still feel at home in Canix. It is making tracking the entire lifecycle of seed to sale for cannabis infinitely easier than just using METRC alone. It allows us to have additional ways to track our harvests, use custom phasing for internal tracking, and makes realtime tracking much more accurate than METRC.”\\nLee Fesler\\nMETRC Data Analyst\\nGreen Releaf Inc\\n“Taking care and tracking product has never been easier. Canix helps to incorporate all of our spreadsheets into a simple system to help us easily track our work flow. Integrating your COGs has never been easier. I would highly reccommend. Canix has helped making receiving orders and creating tags much simpler. When creating bulk tags it is much easier to select from many products rather than individually clicking on each one.”\\nMatthew Joseph\\nTrucenta\\n“Using Canix has made having to use Metrc a whole lot easier. I really enjoy the simplicity of the website’s layout. It’s clean, easy to understand and find where you need to go. Canix is always updating its features to be more intuitive and easy to use. For example, harvesting and destroying waste is limiting with METRC alone, but a breeze with Canix.”\\nAdam Bonsey\\nPackaging Specialist / Sales Coordinator\\nMonterey Tilth Farm\\n“I love that [Canix] works directly with Metrc. My favorite feature is that the batch for the item carries over into Metrc which makes it easier for our customers when purchasing product from us. Canix is helping with automating steps that it takes to complete our orders. For example the transfer template and the adding of the manifest number onto the invoice.”\\nLilly Solis\\nEuphoria Wellness\\n“Canix has made my days much easier. Canix makes sales orders and inventory checks, and reports much more accessible than our previous system. Sales orders and inventory reports are much more accessible than in our previous system. It is much more user friendly.”\\nAmanda Lawson\\nProduction Lead\\nPotWest\\n“[Canix] helps our sales team to accurately sell through inventory faster and it helps our post harvest team plan, schedule and measure output.”\\nAndrew Kazakoff\\nCEO\\nFathom Cannabis\\n\"Best onboarding experience we\\'ve ever had.\"\\nNorCal Cannabis Team\\nNorCal Ca\\nI give Canix a 5/5 for onboarding and implementation!\\nHannah K\\nCompliance Lead\\nAlchemy Pure\\n\"I had the best genetic planning meeting I\\'d ever had last week using Canix and its growth phases charts. And I was able to kill off genetics and see, based on where they were in my supply chain in existence, where my hits were going to be. And I was able to quantify a solution. I would kill things and never know what the end was going to look like. Instead, I knew I had 210 of this one strain through three phases.. it was amazing.\"\\nTravis H\\nGeneral Manager\\nLyfted Farms\\n\"Canix has turned a three-person job into a one-person job... We now have a top-down view of our entire inventory, allowing us to make educated decisions... It\\'s helped us streamline operations, optimize resources, and save hundreds of thousands of dollars across the board.\"\\nWill B\\nFull Spectrum\\n“As a growing business, Canix has helped us understand the cost of production, including labor, of each project we tackle. It also helps us organize inventory which has been a struggle as we have several different warehouses and production locations.”\\nAshley Lowell\\nProduction Manager\\nTrucenta\\n“I like that [Canix] has such a robust system in place, and it makes it easy for us to categorize all of our pieces of each recipe properly. We can use packaging, actives, and all of our necessary components. Cost tracking, manufacturing raw materials tracking, BOM tracking, METRC track and trace, helps with invoicing, helps with CRM needs for sales team, and helps with monthly reporting!”\\nMiles Powers\\nBrand Manager\\nInanna\\n\"I appreciate we only have to use one software as opposed to multiple when using other inventory tracking software. It is way better than any other software I\\'ve used - Biotrack, MJ freeway, Flowhub don\\'t compare.\"\\nAmanda R.\\nAssistant Director of Logistics\\nSeed & Smith\\n\"Canix is great for cannabis accountants. Integrations allow for my clients to do data entry in auser friendly system, and eliminates the need for duplicate data entry into QBO and Metrc.

Very responsive and helpful support staff is a definitely a welcome change from other services. Perfect to use alongside Metrc. It is very intuitive and easy to use. The reporting aspects are definitely helpful.”\\nMichael R.\\nPresident / CEO\\n“I have run cannabis facilities in multiple states. [Canix is] way easier to navigate than Metrc and more reliable in my opinion. The layout is excellent. I’ve used three different software programs to track products in the cannabis industry for 10 years. Tacking and Inventory are the two best things Canix has helped with.”\\nEric Gallagher\\nNaturae Oils\\n“The interface is very easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. For those that are familiar with just working with METRC, you still feel at home in Canix. It is making tracking the entire lifecycle of seed to sale for cannabis infinitely easier than just using METRC alone. It allows us to have additional ways to track our harvests, use custom phasing for internal tracking, and makes realtime tracking much more accurate than METRC.”\\nLee Fesler\\nMETRC Data Analyst\\nGreen Releaf Inc\\n“Taking care and tracking product has never been easier. Canix helps to incorporate all of our spreadsheets into a simple system to help us easily track our work flow. Integrating your COGs has never been easier. I would highly reccommend. Canix has helped making receiving orders and creating tags much simpler. When creating bulk tags it is much easier to select from many products rather than individually clicking on each one.”\\nMatthew Joseph\\nTrucenta\\n“Using Canix has made having to use Metrc a whole lot easier. I really enjoy the simplicity of the website’s layout. It’s clean, easy to understand and find where you need to go. Canix is always updating its features to be more intuitive and easy to use. For example, harvesting and destroying waste is limiting with METRC alone, but a breeze with Canix.”\\nAdam Bonsey\\nPackaging Specialist / Sales Coordinator\\nMonterey Tilth Farm\\n“I love that [Canix] works directly with Metrc. My favorite feature is that the batch for the item carries over into Metrc which makes it easier for our customers when purchasing product from us. Canix is helping with automating steps that it takes to complete our orders. For example the transfer template and the adding of the manifest number onto the invoice.”\\nLilly Solis\\nEuphoria Wellness\\n“Canix has made my days much easier. Canix makes sales orders and inventory checks, and reports much more accessible than our previous system. Sales orders and inventory reports are much more accessible than in our previous system. It is much more user friendly.”\\nAmanda Lawson\\nProduction Lead\\nPotWest\\n“[Canix] helps our sales team to accurately sell through inventory faster and it helps our post harvest team plan, schedule and measure output.”\\nAndrew Kazakoff\\nCEO\\nFathom Cannabis\\n\"Best onboarding experience we\\'ve ever had.\"\\nNorCal Cannabis Team\\nNorCal Ca\\nI give Canix a 5/5 for onboarding and implementation!\\nHannah K\\nCompliance Lead\\nAlchemy Pure\\n\"I had the best genetic planning meeting I\\'d ever had last week using Canix and its growth phases charts. And I was able to kill off genetics and see, based on where they were in my supply chain in existence, where my hits were going to be. And I was able to quantify a solution. I would kill things and never know what the end was going to look like. Instead, I knew I had 210 of this one strain through three phases.. it was amazing.\"\\nTravis H\\nGeneral Manager\\nLyfted Farms\\n\"Canix has turned a three-person job into a one-person job... We now have a top-down view of our entire inventory, allowing us to make educated decisions... It\\'s helped us streamline operations, optimize resources, and save hundreds of thousands of dollars across the board.\"\\nWill B\\nFull Spectrum\\n“As a growing business, Canix has helped us understand the cost of production, including labor, of each project we tackle. It also helps us organize inventory which has been a struggle as we have several different warehouses and production locations.”\\nAshley Lowell\\nProduction Manager\\nTrucenta\\n“I like that [Canix] has such a robust system in place, and it makes it easy for us to categorize all of our pieces of each recipe properly. We can use packaging, actives, and all of our necessary components. Cost tracking, manufacturing raw materials tracking, BOM tracking, METRC track and trace, helps with invoicing, helps with CRM needs for sales team, and helps with monthly reporting!”\\nMiles Powers\\nBrand Manager\\nInanna\\n\"I appreciate we only have to use one software as opposed to multiple when using other inventory tracking software. It is way better than any other software I\\'ve used - Biotrack, MJ freeway, Flowhub don\\'t compare.\"\\nAmanda R.\\nAssistant Director of Logistics\\nSeed & Smith\\n\"Canix is great for cannabis accountants. Integrations allow for my clients to do data entry in auser friendly system, and eliminates the need for duplicate data entry into QBO and Metrc. Saves time every month.\"\\nSean L.\\nTax & Accounting Manager\\n\"Canix has amazing features that make my work easier; killing plants, creating harvests, creating invoices, and printing labels. [Canix is] making it easy to harvest a lot of plants at once and kill plants as a whole instead of individually.\"\\nBrianna S.\\nCompliance Coordinator\\n\"Canix helps to place all of the inventory and the required labs in one spot. This helps to keep our business to meet the requirements of each state for sales.\"\\nRex T.\\nLab Technician\\nRiver Organics\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ee52a0f4be6ffc2aaeb52cd/62f29de9b7b09293f7abe526_Canix%20Map%20Homepage.png)\\nStay up to DAte\\n# **Check out our recent blog posts**\\n![⟨77⟩%20\\\\(7\\\\).png) App Updates2 min readCanix Makes Exceptional Strides in EngineeringCanix Makes Exceptional Strides in EngineeringEric Van EgmondVP of EngineeringFeb 3, 2025](https://www.canix.com/</blog-posts/canix-makes-exceptional-strides-in-engineering>)\\n![⟨78⟩%20\\\\(17\\\\).png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ee52a0f4be6ff7fd8eb52ed/67ae8182fb70fd888d73ab47_Canix%20thumbnails%20\\\\(rectangle%202\\\\)%20\\\\(17\\\\).png)App Updates3 min read2024: Year in ReviewOver the last year, we released more than 290 features and updates.Emily WanlessHead of Product & ImplementationJan 29, 2025](https://www.canix.com/</blog-posts/2024-year-in-review>)\\n![⟨79⟩%20\\\\(18\\\\).png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ee52a0f4be6ff7fd8eb52ed/67ae81c25ccb44e34d9959cc_Canix%20thumbnails%20\\\\(rectangle%202\\\\)%20\\\\(18\\\\).png)Industry News2 min readMetrc v1 API shut down upcoming in Maryland, Oregon, Rhode Island, Michigan, and D.C.Metrc shutting down v1 of its API in Maryland, Oregon, Rhode Island, Michigan, and D.C. for all integrators in the stateStacey HronowskiCEO & Co-FounderDec 18, 2024](https://www.canix.com/</blog-posts/metrc-v1-api-shut-down-upcoming-in-maryland-oregon-rhode-island-michigan-and-d-c>)\\n![⟨80⟩%20\\\\(12\\\\).png)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ee52a0f4be6ff7fd8eb52ed/67ae7d09fb70fd888d6f2c94_Canix%20thumbnails%20\\\\(rectangle%202\\\\)%20\\\\(12\\\\).png)Industry News2 min readNew York BioTrack Transition with Canix - API Released And Seed-to-Sale Provider Selection Timeline AnnouncedOCM released BioTrack API and announces timeline for seed-to-sale provider selectionStacey HronowskiCEO & Co-FounderNov 19, 2024](https://www.canix.com/</blog-posts/new-york-biotrack-transition-with-canix---api-released-and-seed-to-sale-provider-selection-timeline-announced>)\\n#### Ready to Get Started?\\n**Schedule Demo**⟨8⟩\\nThank you!
