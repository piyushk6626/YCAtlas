By deploying AI that learns and adapts to a firm’s specific needs, Dili offers a safeguard against these risks, essentially acting as a supercharged copilot in financial transactions.\n\n**User Testimonials and Endorsements**  \nDili has garnered positive feedback from industry leaders. Garry Tan, the CEO of Y Combinator, lauds Dili's ability to transform diligence efforts from a labor-intensive process into something nearly instantaneous. Users have noted that Dili has uncovered significant errors in multi-million dollar transactions that even seasoned legal teams missed, emphasizing the need for such technology in today's fast-paced financial landscape.\n\n**Tags**: fintech, finance, b2b, investing, AI, New York  \n**Website**: [Dili](https://www.dili.ai)\n\nIn summary, Dili is positioning itself as a game-changer in AI-assisted diligence, delivering precision, efficiency, and confidence in high-stakes financial dealings.
