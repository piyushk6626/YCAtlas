This is all about getting to the root of oral health problems before they escalate into serious conditions.\n\nFor just $169, customers receive a test kit that’s shipped directly to them, allowing for easy sample collection and return.

They are led by Jared Friedman, a Group Partner within the Y Combinator ecosystem, which suggests a strong backing for their ambitious goals.\n\nBy leveraging the expertise of dental professionals and incorporating modern technology, Bristle not only aims to simplify identifying oral health issues but also to empower users with knowledge and personalized care plans. \n\nWith over 10,000 satisfied members and an impressive 4.84-star rating, it seems Bristle is onto something.
