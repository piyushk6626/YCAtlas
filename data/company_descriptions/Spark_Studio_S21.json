After completing his Art of Storytelling course, we signed up for Dramatic Storytelling and Anvay thoroughly enjoyed it and he loves his teacher. \\nAkanksha Jaiswal, Parent of a 7 year old\\nSpark studio helped my child build his personality.... He enjoyed the classes so much that at one point if he refused to listen to us, we'd tell him that we wouldn't let him attend Spark Studio classes & immediately he would change his behavior \\nRajesh, Parent of a 7 year old\\nItâs the one thing she looks forward to everyday. She had initially joined the Art of Storytelling course which she enjoyed so we signed her up for the Dramatic Storytelling course. \\nNiharika, Parent of a 5 year old\\nFantastic class. It made me nostalgic, taking me back to my childhood...kids spinning such magical stories..This was only possible because of the clear direction given by the teacher. I am keen on signing up Jhanavi for more classes on Spark Studio. \\nBhargavi Rao, Parent of a 8 year old\\nIt's great to see the kids grow confident, being able to speak out and learn to recite from memory, the manner of articulation, the gestures, the flow of speech, it was great to see the kids showcase their learnings with so much confidence \\nShikha Gupta, Parent of a 7 year old\\nMokshham loved all his classes...he's learnt a lot in this Public Speaking Course. I admire the teacherâs inspiring and charming nature, it helped Mokshham gain confidence while speaking. \\nShradha Bora, Parent of a 6.5 year old\\nWe were looking for something new that the kids could learn. Having small batches of 5-6 kids in each class, & giving them a holistic environment to learn in a structured manner, enabled them to speak about any topic, making them good public speakers. \\nGarima Satija, Parent of a 8 year old\\nDhruv loves this class, he loves listening to the stories and enacting them, im sure that if there is a Part 2 or Part 3 of these classes Dhruv would love to be a part of it \\nCharita Malpuri, Parent of a 7 year old\\nI liked that the course had a variety of art techniques & included works from famous artists. I was surprised at how much my son started to talk about the art he did and what he thought about it! Well-designed course. \\nRatna Sridhar, Parent of a 10 year old\\nItâs the one thing she looks forward to everyday. She had initially joined the Art of Storytelling course which she enjoyed so we signed her up for the Dramatic Storytelling course. \\nRakesh, Parent of a 5 year old\\nSanya absolutely loved the animation course. She is making a ton of her own films now, even birthday cards for family, and I'm glad to see she is finding this so enjoyable. The advanced course is great and it's taking her interest further. \\nRochelle, Parent of a 7 year old\\nIshaan is thoroughly enjoying his music lessons with Spark Studio. He keeps humming songs all the time. He is keen to do his homework assignments and logs in for class 10 mins before time. We were skeptical about him learning music online, but it's worked very well. \\nChintan Shah, Parent of a 7 year old\\nThe instructor was very patient, and spent a good amount of time on practice and getting my son's fingers to move quicker and correctly. They also developed a nice bond over the two levels we did with instructor. Great experience! \\nRubina, Parent of a 11 year old\\nThe teacher taught concepts that I felt would have been tough, but Sanya picked up most of it and started taking photos of everything around the house. She also liked that the teacher believed in her. \\nPratik, Parent of a 9 year old\\nThis was a great course, along with my son even I enjoyed it. The teacher made it quite easy, and in a step-by-step way was able to take my son's skills to a pretty advanced level. All his friends also love his films, and he is quite excited about it. \\nAbhishek, Parent of a 9 year old\\nI would highly recommend this for creative kids. For my daughter, it's like the course has opened up a whole new passion and part of her brain. The teacher has also been very inspirational and it's very cool that my child got to interact with an artist who studied design in London. This kind of exposure is great, and pretty hard to get otherwise. \\nAakash, Parent of a 13 year old\\nWe had a fantastic experience with Spark Studio. The way they teach the concepts of music in the western vocals course is truly wonderful. We were also delighted that our daughter had the opportunity to learn with an amazing artist like Ms. Meera, we couldn't have got that anywhere else! \\nRhea, Parent of a 9 year old\\nThe vocal music course was an absolute delight. I liked the attention paid to practice. I particularly appreciate the revision videos after each class - between the classes, my daughter was able to practice on her own too, and it was quite fun for her. \\nKiaana, Parent of a 11 year old\\nFantastic class. It made me nostalgic, taking me back to my childhood...kids spinning such magical stories..This was only possible because of the clear direction given by the teacher. I am keen on signing up Jhanavi for more classes on Spark Studio. \\nBhargavi Rao, Parent of a 8 year old\\nIt's great to see the kids grow confident, being able to speak out and learn to recite from memory, the manner of articulation, the gestures, the flow of speech, it was great to see the kids showcase their learnings with so much confidence \\nShikha Gupta, Parent of a 7 year old\\nWe were looking for something new that the kids could learn.

He enjoyed the classes so much that at one point if he refused to listen to us, we'd tell him that we wouldn't let him attend Spark Studio classes & immediately he would change his behavior \\nRajesh, Parent of a 7 year old\\nItâs the one thing she looks forward to everyday. She had initially joined the Art of Storytelling course which she enjoyed so we signed her up for the Dramatic Storytelling course. \\nNiharika, Parent of a 5 year old\\nFantastic class. It made me nostalgic, taking me back to my childhood...kids spinning such magical stories..This was only possible because of the clear direction given by the teacher. I am keen on signing up Jhanavi for more classes on Spark Studio. \\nBhargavi Rao, Parent of a 8 year old\\nIt's great to see the kids grow confident, being able to speak out and learn to recite from memory, the manner of articulation, the gestures, the flow of speech, it was great to see the kids showcase their learnings with so much confidence \\nShikha Gupta, Parent of a 7 year old\\nMokshham loved all his classes...he's learnt a lot in this Public Speaking Course. I admire the teacherâs inspiring and charming nature, it helped Mokshham gain confidence while speaking. \\nShradha Bora, Parent of a 6.5 year old\\nWe were looking for something new that the kids could learn. Having small batches of 5-6 kids in each class, & giving them a holistic environment to learn in a structured manner, enabled them to speak about any topic, making them good public speakers. \\nGarima Satija, Parent of a 8 year old\\nDhruv loves this class, he loves listening to the stories and enacting them, im sure that if there is a Part 2 or Part 3 of these classes Dhruv would love to be a part of it \\nCharita Malpuri, Parent of a 7 year old\\nI liked that the course had a variety of art techniques & included works from famous artists.

The advanced course is great and it's taking her interest further. \\nRochelle, Parent of a 7 year old\\nIshaan is thoroughly enjoying his music lessons with Spark Studio. He keeps humming songs all the time. He is keen to do his homework assignments and logs in for class 10 mins before time. We were skeptical about him learning music online, but it's worked very well. \\nChintan Shah, Parent of a 7 year old\\nThe instructor was very patient, and spent a good amount of time on practice and getting my son's fingers to move quicker and correctly. They also developed a nice bond over the two levels we did with instructor. Great experience! \\nRubina, Parent of a 11 year old\\nThe teacher taught concepts that I felt would have been tough, but Sanya picked up most of it and started taking photos of everything around the house.

For my daughter, it's like the course has opened up a whole new passion and part of her brain. The teacher has also been very inspirational and it's very cool that my child got to interact with an artist who studied design in London. This kind of exposure is great, and pretty hard to get otherwise. \\nAakash, Parent of a 13 year old\\nWe had a fantastic experience with Spark Studio. The way they teach the concepts of music in the western vocals course is truly wonderful. We were also delighted that our daughter had the opportunity to learn with an amazing artist like Ms. Meera, we couldn't have got that anywhere else! \\nRhea, Parent of a 9 year old\\nThe vocal music course was an absolute delight. I liked the attention paid to practice. I particularly appreciate the revision videos after each class - between the classes, my daughter was able to practice on her own too, and it was quite fun for her. \\nKiaana, Parent of a 11 year old\\nFantastic class.
