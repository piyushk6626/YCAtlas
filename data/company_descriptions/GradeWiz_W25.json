This feedback includes comments on key areas such as content accuracy, writing quality, and overall presentation. You can review and edit the feedback to ensure it meets your standards and addresses specific points you want to emphasize. To edit the feedback, open the student\\'s submission, and you will see the AI-generated comments. Click on any comment to modify it or add additional notes. You can also add new comments to the submission for more personalized feedback.\\n### [Can I use my rubrics for grading? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)\\nYes, you can create custom rubrics in the \"Rubrics\" section and apply them to assignments for consistent and detailed grading. Additionally, you can use GradeWiz AI to generate detailed, specific rubrics for your assignment by clicking on the Magic Wand icon next to your question.\\n### [How accurate is the AI-generated feedback? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)\\nGradeWiz has a 95% accuracy rate when benchmarked against teaching assistants for introductory to medium-level classes.\\n### [How do I share graded assignments with students? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)\\nClick \"Publish Grades\" on the assignment page to share graded assignments with students.\\n### [Can students see the grading rubrics? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)\\nYes, students can view the grading rubrics used for their assignments.\\n### [How do I provide an answer key for an assignment? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)\\nAfter creating the assignment, professors should download the PDF, fill it out, and submit it for extraction. This is optional but highly encouraged as it increases grading accuracy and allows for less detailed rubrics.\\n### [How do I delete my account? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)\\nGo to your profile, select \"Delete Account,\" and confirm. This will permanently delete all associated data, including classes, grades, and submission history.\\n### [What data does GradeWiz collect from users? ![plus](https://www.gradewiz.ai/images/plus.svg) ](https://www.gradewiz.ai/<#>)\\nGradeWiz only collects necessary cookies to keep you logged in.
