What used to take teams of people and hours of manual work can now be fully automated with Fazeshift. \r\n\nCaitlin and Timmy met while getting their MBA at Harvard. After graduating, they started a B2B marketing software startup, which is where they first experienced the pain of this process.\r\n\nThe problem stems from fragmented data across software platforms like QuickBooks, Stripe, NetSuite, DocuSign, HubSpot, and Salesforce. Fazeshiftâ€™s infrastructure connects the data across these software platforms and uses LLMs to automate the previously manual workflow.",
