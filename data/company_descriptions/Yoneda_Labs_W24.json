  "description": "Yoneda Labs provides software to help chemists optimise reactions. When chemists make a drug or a material, we help them figure out the best reaction parameters such as temperature, concentration and catalyst.\r\n\nWhen Jan was working at chemical labs, he experienced the struggle of spending weeks guessing reaction conditions. We then started experimenting with ML to speed up the process.\r\n\nNow, as a team of three friends from the University of Cambridge, we’ve spent the last month combining our domain expertise in Computer Science, Machine Learning and Chemistry to develop state of the art models for reaction optimisation.\r\n\nAlthough ML is becoming well established in other fields, current chemical models generalise poorly and require lots of programming experience. We make our models easily accessible to chemists in the lab.\r\n\nFinding the right conditions quickly allows pharmaceutical companies to test more drugs, and finding better optima makes manufacturing process cheaper and more environmentally friendly.",

  "generated_description": "**Yoneda Labs: Revolutionizing Chemical Manufacturing with AI**\n\nYoneda Labs, founded in 2023 and part of the Y Combinator Batch W24, is a dynamic startup on a mission to transform chemical manufacturing through a foundation model designed specifically for this space. It emerged from the experience of its co-founder Jan, who, while working in chemical labs, encountered the frustrating reality of spending weeks trying to determine optimal reaction conditions for drug and material synthesis. This common struggle led him and his friends from the University of Cambridge to leverage machine learning in a bid to streamline and enhance the process.\n\nThe crux of what Yoneda Labs does is providing software that allows chemists to optimize reactions efficiently. Their models are aimed at simplifying the complex task of figuring out the best reaction parameters—like temperature, concentration, and catalysts—allowing chemists to focus more on innovation rather than trial and error.\n\n**Why Yoneda Labs Matters**\n\nIn many industries, including pharmaceuticals and chemical manufacturing, the existing machine learning models haven't lived up to their promise—they generalize poorly and often require extensive programming skills. Yoneda tackles this head-on by creating user-friendly models that chemists can access directly in the lab. This accessibility is a game changer. Their technology not only speeds up the process but also helps companies test more drugs and improve their manufacturing processes, leading to cost reductions and lower environmental impacts.\n\n**The Team and Backing**\n\nWith a compact team of just three talented employees, Yoneda Labs combines expertise in Computer Science, Machine Learning, and Chemistry. Their work is backed by reputable firms, including Y Combinator and Khosla Ventures, highlighting the confidence investors have in their vision.\n\n**Key Features Offered by Yoneda Labs**\n\n1. **Predict**: Enhances the ability to predict reliable conditions for novel reactions, accelerating the nomination of lead compounds significantly.\n2. **Optimize**: Provides insights that can save millions on large-scale projects, pinpointing optimal process conditions much faster.\n3. **Analyze**: Automates the tedious task of LCMS (Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry) data analysis, saving valuable time in the lab.\n\nOverall, Yoneda Labs is making strides in an area that should have seen progress long ago. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques with practical chemistry, they're not just facilitating research; they're enabling breakthroughs in medicine and manufacturing that have broad implications. \n\nFor more details, check out their website: [Yoneda Labs](https://www.yonedalabs.com)."
