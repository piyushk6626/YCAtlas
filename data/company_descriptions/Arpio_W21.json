We’ve got answers.\\nDoesn’t AWS already have disaster recovery?\\nThere are a lot of backup and recovery features in AWS, but assembling these into a disaster recovery capability is your responsibility. It’s part of AWS’s “shared responsibility model.” You can read about it [here](https://arpio.io/<https:/docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/shared-responsibility-model-for-resiliency.html>).\\nHow will using Arpio impact my AWS bill?\\nArpio replicates data and infrastructure into an AWS account that you control, so you’ll be responsible for the cost of data storage and transfer. But we use the most cost-effective techniques available in AWS, and our customers often report that their DR environment costs just 1-2% of their production environment.\\nCan I use Arpio to recover from a ransomware attack?\\nYes! Arpio maintains historical snapshots of your environment, and you can use Arpio to recover to a point in time before the ransomware attack began. Arpio also protects your backups so that the attacker can’t undermine your ability to recover.\\nWill there be data loss when I failover with Arpio?\\nThat depends on your recovery point objective (your RPO), and which AWS services you’re using. For many services, Arpio can replicate your data as it is updated in production, so there’s nothing lost (or close to it!) if you need to failover.\\nHow does failback work with Arpio?\\nArpio’s failback process takes a snapshot of the data in your recovery environment and restores it to the original infrastructure in your production environment. You can test the failback process as many times as you’d like so you’ll be confident that it will work when it’s finally time to return to your primary environment.\\nDo I have to have infrastructure automation in place?\\nNope! It’s great if you do, but Arpio is driven by what you’ve got in your production environment, not what’s written in your automation. Our customers span the spectrum from no automation to full automation, and everything in between.\\nHow do I test my DR solution with Arpio?\\nArpio makes DR testing easy and non-disruptive for your production workloads. Arpio allows you to easily spin up your recovery environment in test mode, giving you an opportunity to validate that your applications would work in a failover scenario. While in test mode, your production system remains online and processing production traffic. And, because of Arpio’s sophisticated automation, the full testing process can often be completed in minutes. Gone are the days of working a long weekend to validate your DR during an outage window.\\n![](https://arpio.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gray-curvy-boy.svg)\\n## Looking to Learn About DR?

We’ve got answers.\\nDoesn’t AWS already have disaster recovery?\\nThere are a lot of backup and recovery features in AWS, but assembling these into a disaster recovery capability is your responsibility. It’s part of AWS’s “shared responsibility model.” You can read about it here⟨38⟩.\\nHow will using Arpio impact my AWS bill?\\nArpio replicates data and infrastructure into an AWS account that you control, so you’ll be responsible for the cost of data storage and transfer. But we use the most cost-effective techniques available in AWS, and our customers often report that their DR environment costs just 1-2% of their production environment.\\nCan I use Arpio to recover from a ransomware attack?\\nYes! Arpio maintains historical snapshots of your environment, and you can use Arpio to recover to a point in time before the ransomware attack began. Arpio also protects your backups so that the attacker can’t undermine your ability to recover.\\nWill there be data loss when I failover with Arpio?\\nThat depends on your recovery point objective (your RPO), and which AWS services you’re using. For many services, Arpio can replicate your data as it is updated in production, so there’s nothing lost (or close to it!) if you need to failover.\\nHow does failback work with Arpio?\\nArpio’s failback process takes a snapshot of the data in your recovery environment and restores it to the original infrastructure in your production environment. You can test the failback process as many times as you’d like so you’ll be confident that it will work when it’s finally time to return to your primary environment.\\nDo I have to have infrastructure automation in place?\\nNope! It’s great if you do, but Arpio is driven by what you’ve got in your production environment, not what’s written in your automation. Our customers span the spectrum from no automation to full automation, and everything in between.\\nHow do I test my DR solution with Arpio?\\nArpio makes DR testing easy and non-disruptive for your production workloads. Arpio allows you to easily spin up your recovery environment in test mode, giving you an opportunity to validate that your applications would work in a failover scenario. While in test mode, your production system remains online and processing production traffic. And, because of Arpio’s sophisticated automation, the full testing process can often be completed in minutes. Gone are the days of working a long weekend to validate your DR during an outage window.\\n![](https://arpio.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gray-curvy-boy.svg)\\n## Looking to Learn About DR?
