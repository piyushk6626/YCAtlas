Memfault provides the tools to drive more efficient issue resolution, better decision-making, and more effective teams.\\n[ Learn More ](https://memfault.com/</product/>)\\n##### Less time fixing more time building\\nRoot cause issues in hours and get back to building and shipping great features. \\n##### Make better decisions\\nGet a complete view of firmware quality, device health and feature usage all in one place and use it to make good decisions. \\n##### Reduce operational costs\\nAvoid wasting time and money building your own systems and hiring extra people to maintain them as you scale.\\n##### Accelerate time to market\\nShorten product development and QA time without sacrificing device quality and performance.\\n## Will Memfault work for me?\\n#### We know embedded devices are all unique, that\\'s why we built Memfault to be super flexible.\\n##### My devices aren\\'t always connected - will Memfault work for me?\\nYes! Memfault is designed to work on devices with intermittent connectivity and it wont mean you have gaps in your data. We buffer data on the device when it’s not connected and send it to the cloud once connectivity is available.\\n##### My device sends data via a companion device or gateway - will Memfault work for me?\\nYes! Memfault works on devices that don’t have direct connectivity. We can send data via more or less any path to cloud, whether that’s via a gateway or a companion device.\\n##### Code space on my device is limited - will Memfault work for me?\\nAlmost definitely! Memfault is very flexible and be configured to suit your requirements. The on device space taken by Memfault varies but standard MCU implementations require approximately 4.5kb of ROM and 1.5kb of RAM.\\n##### My device contains multiple chips - will Memfault work for me?\\nYes! Memfault can collect data from multiple chips on the same device. Talk to us for guidance on the best set-up in these more complicated implementations.\\n##### My device is very power constrained - will Memfault drain my battery?\\nMemfault is deployed to lots of very lower power devices already. Our customers have done rigorous testing and found that Memfault has no measurable impact on battery life.\\n##### My device is on a metered network with low bandwidth - will Memfault work for me?\\nYes! We have customers sending data over multiple different connectivity types including satellite and various LPWA networks. Memfault can be configured to send data in very small packets (<9 bytes) so works in lots of connectivity constrained use cases.\\n## Partner Ecosystem\\nMemfault is proud to work with partners from across the IoT ecosystem.

Memfault provides the tools to drive more efficient issue resolution, better decision-making, and more effective teams.\\n Learn More ⟨4⟩\\n##### Less time fixing more time building\\nRoot cause issues in hours and get back to building and shipping great features. \\n##### Make better decisions\\nGet a complete view of firmware quality, device health and feature usage all in one place and use it to make good decisions. \\n##### Reduce operational costs\\nAvoid wasting time and money building your own systems and hiring extra people to maintain them as you scale.\\n##### Accelerate time to market\\nShorten product development and QA time without sacrificing device quality and performance.\\n## Will Memfault work for me?\\n#### We know embedded devices are all unique, that's why we built Memfault to be super flexible.\\n##### My devices aren't always connected - will Memfault work for me?\\nYes! Memfault is designed to work on devices with intermittent connectivity and it wont mean you have gaps in your data. We buffer data on the device when it’s not connected and send it to the cloud once connectivity is available.\\n##### My device sends data via a companion device or gateway - will Memfault work for me?\\nYes! Memfault works on devices that don’t have direct connectivity. We can send data via more or less any path to cloud, whether that’s via a gateway or a companion device.\\n##### Code space on my device is limited - will Memfault work for me?\\nAlmost definitely! Memfault is very flexible and be configured to suit your requirements. The on device space taken by Memfault varies but standard MCU implementations require approximately 4.5kb of ROM and 1.5kb of RAM.\\n##### My device contains multiple chips - will Memfault work for me?\\nYes! Memfault can collect data from multiple chips on the same device. Talk to us for guidance on the best set-up in these more complicated implementations.\\n##### My device is very power constrained - will Memfault drain my battery?\\nMemfault is deployed to lots of very lower power devices already. Our customers have done rigorous testing and found that Memfault has no measurable impact on battery life.\\n##### My device is on a metered network with low bandwidth - will Memfault work for me?\\nYes! We have customers sending data over multiple different connectivity types including satellite and various LPWA networks. Memfault can be configured to send data in very small packets (<9 bytes) so works in lots of connectivity constrained use cases.\\n## Partner Ecosystem\\nMemfault is proud to work with partners from across the IoT ecosystem.
