It is a true platform technology because it enables the joining of any two soluble proteins together with minimal engineering and without restrictions due to protein size or complexity. Our work has already been used to modify cancer specific antibodies, CRISPR proteins and even cell surfaces. Our ability to produce modular protein therapeutics in a fraction of the time allows for true library creation across the therapeutics spectrum from oncology, vaccines, inflammatory disease and beyond.",

  "generated_description": "**Catena Biosciences: Innovating Proteins for the Future of Healthcare**\n\nFounded in 2020 and hailing from Berkeley, CA, Catena Biosciences is on an ambitious mission: to harness the power of protein coupling to forge groundbreaking therapies across a spectrum of diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions. The company is a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch S21, marking its place in the vibrant landscape of biotech innovation.\n\nAt the heart of Catena's technology is their unique platform that allows for the seamless attachment of two proteins using the Catenase™ enzyme. This patented method, which leverages native amino acids like tyrosine and cysteine, sidesteps traditional limitations in protein engineering—think size and complexity constraints. It’s a big deal because it means you can create modular protein therapeutics rapidly and efficiently, fostering true innovation in therapeutic development.\n\nImagine transforming antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in ways that were previously unthinkable: combining antibodies with functional cytokines, or tagging proteins onto cell surfaces without the need for genetic alterations. That’s the essence of Catena's vision—making the creation of biologics as straightforward as working with small molecules.\n\nCurrently, Catena operates with a nimble team of seven, led by a partnership with the experience of Nan. Their pipeline promises revolutionary advancements, particularly their Multi-Payload Conjugate™ technology, which aims to redefine how ADCs are conceived and developed.\n\nAs they continue to push boundaries in the biotech field, Catena Biosciences is shedding light on a future where therapies are only limited by our imagination.
