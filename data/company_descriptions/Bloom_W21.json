I love how this app has shown me as well as taught me everything I know now about stocks and trading. I really enjoy learning new things and getting smarter, especially in areas I’ve never touched before. A couple of months ago I never imagined I’d be spending hundreds from my part time job paychecks on the stock market hoping to prosper, but here I am. Thank you to the bloom community for creating this app I enjoy everyday! I hope you guys will continue to update this app frequently and teach us even more things!\\n#### **WatarBottle**\\nJuly 23, 2023\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63752cdcaf7ff24052ab239e/63752cdcaf7ff20272ab23fc_recall__star.svg)\\n### I’ve learned so much\\nI really recommend Bloom. It’s worth the price because of the education, confidence, and safety it gives you. I had other apps like Robinhood before, but I mainly just lost out or if I was lucky I was only gaining like a few cents. They didn’t really help, they incentivized me to buy when I shouldn’t have. Bloom shows me risk ratings, analyst ratings and stats in a super simple but comprehensive way. They show you what everything means, so even to a complete noob like I was, everything just made sense. It made me feel so much more comfortable. Cannot recommend more!!\\n#### **Emilie B.**\\nJuly 7, 2023\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63752cdcaf7ff24052ab239e/63752cdcaf7ff20272ab23fc_recall__star.svg)\\n### Great app, perfect start!\\nI have loved using Bloom! I\\'m 19, so the app setup is super helpful. It is set up in a simple way that allows me to really familiarize myself with stocks. The lessons are intriguing but provide great information! It is a great program and very helpful. I highly recommend for people genuinely interested and dedicated to learning about the stock market. \\n#### **Ben A.

I looked into the app and decided to give it a try. The app has really sparked his interest in financial literacy and investing. He is actually looking into majoring in business with a focus in financial planning, and he is loving the educational modules in the app. Highly recommended!\\n#### Mountaineermac\\nMay 10, 2022\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63752cdcaf7ff24052ab239e/63752cdcaf7ff20272ab23fc_recall__star.svg)\\n### 14 year old really learning about investing!\\nSo far, we are really happy with this app. My son really likes the interface, and he\\'s learning quite a bit about investing, which is great!
