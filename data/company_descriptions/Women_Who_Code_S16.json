The movement grew, city by city, fueled by passionate volunteers that were inspired by the mission and vision. In 2013, Women Who Code, Inc., was registered as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in California and moved its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia in 2018. \\nAs a community, we are powerful. For more than a decade, Women Who Code has created a sense of belonging in tech and support for our community, thanks to the dedication and commitment of our members, volunteers, and staff. We have brought together a vibrant community of over 360,000 technologists who deeply care about building an industry that is more diverse, inclusive, and equitable. Today, more than 1,000 volunteers lead local and digital communities, members in 145 countries worldwide give technical talks daily to share knowledge and mentor each other, and a close-knit globally distributed team at WWCode HQ drives the day to day operations. \\nTogether, we’ve delivered more than 20 thousand community-led events, awarded more than $3.5 million in scholarships, held developer conferences and technical summits in tech hubs around the world, logged more than one million high-skilled, leadership-building volunteer hours, given away more than $2.5 million in conference tickets for broader industry engagement, and shared more than 14,000 job opportunities. Even more than these trackable outputs, we’ve come together to support each other, navigate the industry as a powerful force, share both technical protips and strategies for rising in our careers, and break barriers. \\nIt is with profound sadness that, today, on April 18, 2024, we are announcing the difficult decision to close Women Who Code, following a vote by the Board of Directors to dissolve the organization. This decision has not been made lightly. It only comes after careful consideration of all options and is due to factors that have materially impacted our funding sources – funds that were critical to continuing our programming and delivering on our mission. We understand that this news will come as a disappointment to many, and we want to express our deepest gratitude to each and every one of you who have been a part of our journey.\\n![](https://admin.womenwhocode.dev/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Quote-Journey-of-Success-From-Education-to-Early-Career-Triumphs-Part-1-1024x576.png)\\n**_While so much has been accomplished, our mission is not complete and our vision of a tech industry where diverse women and historically excluded people thrive at every level is not fulfilled._**\\nDespite our collective efforts, the challenges we face as an organization have become insurmountable.

The world needs women and diverse perspectives at the helm of tech as a critical force that shapes our world every day.

  "generated_description": "**Women Who Code: Empowering Diversity in Tech**\n\nWomen Who Code (WWCode) is a nonprofit organization on a mission to empower diverse women to excel in technology careers. Founded in 2013, the organization began as a grassroots movement in San Francisco in 2011, initiated by a small group of engineers seeking a supportive community. It has since matured into a global entity, dedicated to fostering a tech industry where women and historically excluded individuals can thrive at all levels.\n\n### Key Achievements\nWith over **320,000 members across **147 countries, WWCode has hosted **more than 15,000** free events, empowering participants through networking, technical skills training, and leadership development. The organization has awarded over **$3.5 million** in scholarships, facilitated **$2.5 million** worth of conference tickets, and shared **14,000 job opportunities**, creating a robust community that advocates for inclusion and equity in tech. Each of these actions reflects their core values: focusing on the mission, designing for inclusion, advocating for change, and journeying forward together. \n\n### What They Offer\nWomen Who Code provides various low- to no-barrier programs aimed at advancing the careers of women in tech. These include:\n- A vast **job board** with opportunities for finding positions in tech.\n- Events and workshops designed to enhance both technical and leadership skills.\n- A supportive network of **mentors and peers** offering guidance and encouragement in navigating the tech landscape.\n\n### Future and Challenges\nDespite its remarkable growth and impact, Women Who Code recently announced its decision to dissolve the organization, effective April 18, 2024. This decision, made by the Board of Directors, comes in light of significant funding challenges that hindered the continuation of its programs. While this marks the end of an era, the organization encourages its members and supporters to keep the spirit of advocacy alive in the tech community.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe legacy of Women Who Code will live on through the relationships formed and the skills developed within its community. As they wind down activities, the team expresses heartfelt gratitude to everyone who contributed to this vital movement for diversity in technology. Future advocates of inclusivity are called to carry forward the ideals of Women Who Code, ensuring that the fight for diverse representation in tech continues. \n\nFor more information or to stay connected, visit [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com) or reach out at contact@womenwhocode.com."
