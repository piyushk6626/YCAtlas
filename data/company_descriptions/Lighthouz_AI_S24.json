  "generated_description": "**Lighthouz AI: Revolutionizing Procurement Through Automation**\n\nLighthouz AI is an exciting startup on a mission to transform the procurement landscape for manufacturers. Launched in 2023 as part of Y Combinator's Batch S24 and located in San Francisco, the company aims to leverage artificial intelligence to vastly improve productivity among procurement professionals—specifically the 500,000 workers who currently spend up to 90% of their time bogged down with tedious tasks like emailing suppliers and data entry in outdated ERP systems.\n\nThe brainchild behind this innovation, Dr. Srijan Kumar, has a resume that speaks volumes: former research scientist at Google, professor at Georgia Tech, and experience building AI systems for major companies like Meta and Home Depot. Alongside him is Sonali Pattnaik, a former lead AI engineer with a proven track record of saving millions at various firms. Together, they bring over 20 years of combined expertise to the table.\n\nWhat’s their secret sauce? **Enter Pam**, the AI procurement assistant, designed to automate manual procurement tasks—effectively set to increase team productivity by a staggering 15 times. Pam takes over the heavy lifting: it handles data verification, invoice auditing, purchase order (PO) creation, and even supplier communications. By automating up to 80% of these tasks, Lighthouz AI not only saves countless hours but also mitigates the risk of human error, such as overbilling.\n\nBut the impact goes beyond just efficiency. Lighthouz AI’s technology is poised to disrupt the procurement profession as we know it, projecting a significant transformation in the workforce over the next decade. With automation taking root, the reality is that many procurement jobs may see monumental shifts—500,000 roles potentially replaced. \n\nTheir service is tagged as ‘SaaS’, ‘workflow-automation’, and ‘ai’, among others, signaling a blend of modern technology and operational efficiency. With a compact but skilled team of just three employees, including Dr. Kumar and Sonali Pattnaik, Lighthouz AI's focus remains clear: to reinvent procurement workflows and deliver tangible results for manufacturers.\n\nSo, if you’re looking to future-proof your procurement processes, Lighthouz AI and its intelligent assistant Pam might just be your go-to. They are not just selling software; they’re reshaping the future of work, one automated task at a time.\n\nYou can learn more about their groundbreaking work on their website: [Lighthouz.ai](https://lighthouz.ai/)."
