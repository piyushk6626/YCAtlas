  "generated_description": "Double Robotics, founded in 2012 and hailing from Burlingame, CA, is on the cutting edge of remote communication technology with its flagship product, the Double—one of the world’s leading telepresence robots. The company is dedicated to enhancing how telecommuters connect and collaborate with their colleagues, effectively making the remote workplace feel less remote.\n\nThe Double is essentially a mobile videoconferencing system on wheels. Picture this: instead of being tethered to a desk during video calls, you can move freely around your workspace, interacting with your team as if you were all in the same room. It combines advanced technology and user-friendly design, making it the ultimate tool for anyone working from home. This innovation doesn’t just make remote work possible; it makes it vibrant and engaging.\n\nAs part of its mission, Double Robotics aims to create a more connected world through these remote experiences. With a team of 11 talented employees and support from Y Combinator (Batch S12), the company is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in hybrid working environments. Their latest model, the Double 3, exemplifies this commitment. It offers features like self-driving capabilities, pan-tilt-zoom cameras, and a mixed reality interface—transforming how remote team members interact in real-time.\n\nIn a world that increasingly embraces flexible work schedules, Double Robotics is positioning itself as a leader in this shift, providing the tools necessary for hybrid offices and classrooms. With the ability to navigate autonomously and a robust feature set designed for ease of use, it’s clear that they are not just part of the conversation about remote work—they are reshaping it.\n\nFor more information, you can visit their website [here](https://doublerobotics.com) or reach out via email at info@doublerobotics.com."
