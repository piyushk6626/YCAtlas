  "description": "Gain muscle and shed fat with a digital twin of your body. BODYSIM is an app-based simulation of your body and its potential that recommends nutrition and exercise to meet your goals. Use BODYSIM to (1) Assemble your data from food logging, BIA weigh-ins, DEXA scans, at-home blood tests, and wearables, (2) Learn to “triangulate the truth” of your unique metabolism and physiology, and (3) Adjust your nutrition and exercise plans by simulating what will happen to your body. One founder put on 45 lbs muscle, and another put on 25 lbs of muscle while losing 50 lbs of fat. Our alpha testers lost an average of 12.6 pounds in 3 months.\r\n\nOur core technology distills messy academic literature into simulations. Before turning to our own fitness journeys, we successfully deployed sophisticated enterprise models of plant-soil-atmosphere, consumer behavior and battery electrochemistry. With BODYSIM we built a science-based simulation of macronutrient balance and muscle hypertrophy. It includes cell turnover, oxidation for energy, lipolysis of fat stores, synthesis of new muscle, glycogen resynthesis, GI latency, and even ketones. Get jacked at BODYSIM.com",

I used to work out 4 or 5 times a week and just maintain, not understanding what I do now. \\nThrough BODYSIM, I learned so much more about the food I put in my body and things I didn’t know before. I was very narrow-minded, and the detail provided by BODYSIM really expanded my understanding of what constitutes a plan. \\nBODYSIM helped me realize what “healthy” is. I think a lot of people don’t really understand macronutrition.

To get the full BODYSIM experience, you will need to:\\n  * Describe your frame with initial measurements, like height and wrist circumference.\\n  * Get a DEXA scan at a DEXAFit location to baseline your starting muscle, bone and fat composition.\\n  * Complete our baseline at-home blood test to ensure select hormones, diet markers and vitamins/minerals aren’t holding you back.\\n  * Track your daily macros in the BODYSIM app’s food journal.\\n  * Weigh yourself most days on the provided WiFi body composition scale.\\n  * Let the BODYSIM team help you set a body composition goal, such as to lose 5 pounds of fat and gain 10 pounds of muscle over 4 months.\\n  * Let us help you define a diet and exercise plan describing your daily calories, macros, resistance training and cardio.\\n  * Wear a fitness tracker.\\n\\n\\n###  How do I set goals that are personalized to my workout and nutrition regimen?\\nSetting a realistic goal can be hard for two major reasons. First, it’s difficult to set a goal that’s personalized to all the factors of your physiology and metabolism–what’s right for someone else might not be right for your body. Second, there are many different paths to achieving that realistic goal with different levels of pain. Sure, you could lift for 4 hours a day or go on a 1,000-calorie crash diet to get there fast. But is it worth it for you? How high a price are you willing to pay?\\nBODYSIM learns your unique metabolism and physiology so you can set goals that are realistic for your body. It allows you to simulate how different diet and exercise plans would allow you to reach your goals, so you can pick and dial in a plan that works for your body and your life.\\n###  Which smartwatches and activity trackers does BODYSIM integrate with?\\nBODYSIM integrates with any fitness tracker that supports Apple Health. This includes Apple Watch, Garmin watches (Venu, Forerunner, Instinct, Epix and Fenix) and trackers (including Vivosmart), Whoop, Oura and Withings watches.\\nSome BODYSIM users have had difficulty getting Oura rings to track workout heart rates, presumably due to the lack of half ring sizes. We do not recommend purchasing a new Oura ring for BODYSIM unless you already know it is capable of tracking workout heart rates on you. If your Oura ring does track your workout heart rate, it will work with BODYSIM.\\nBODYSIM does NOT support Fitbit or Google Pixel trackers or watches, as these devices do not integrate with Apple Health.\\n###  Do I need to consult with my physician before using BODYSIM?\\nBODYSIM is an informational tool and is not designed to diagnose or treat any disease. BODYSIM results are for informational purposes only and are not intended to replace or substitute for a physician’s medical judgment or to be relied upon as a professional opinion. No communication from BODYSIM is intended to be or should be construed as medical advice. Always consult your physician or medical professional for any medical advice, decision or actions regarding your health care, or when changing your workouts, supplements or diet.\\n###  I have a question that’s not answered here.

We\\'ve deployed science-based models of consumer behavior and battery electrochemistry to enterprise. \\n##### Alpha Outcomes\\nIn our alpha test (ages 29-69, 50% female). 8 alpha testers lost an average of 12.6 pounds in 3 months, and 4 alpha testers with a maintain goal changed <1.4 pounds in 3 months. \\n![Image⟨31⟩] Before\\n![Image⟨32⟩] After\\n![Image⟨33⟩] Before\\n![Image⟨34⟩] After\\n# Testimonials\\nBODYSIM really helped me manage my hypertension and prediabetes in ways that my GP was very excited about. It not only improved my weight but also my other numbers. \\nThe scans were very informative, and I learned a lot through the process of setting up my goals in BODYSIM—insights I never received from my nutritionist or GP. \\n![Avatar⟨35⟩]\\nJim Age 57\\nI’ve tried most other fitness apps and they were all giving me different results, so nothing was working. Before BODYSIM, I wasn’t getting anywhere on my own. I needed help. \\nBODYSIM helped me figure out my actual macros, and just by making those adjustments, I lost 8 pounds in 4 months. That was my goal, to lose half a pound a week. \\n![Avatar⟨36⟩]\\nStephen Age 39\\nBefore BODYSIM, I thought I was “in shape,” but using the app and seeing the scans, I saw that much of what I was doing was not actually healthy in the way I thought. I used to work out 4 or 5 times a week and just maintain, not understanding what I do now. \\nThrough BODYSIM, I learned so much more about the food I put in my body and things I didn’t know before. I was very narrow-minded, and the detail provided by BODYSIM really expanded my understanding of what constitutes a plan. \\nBODYSIM helped me realize what “healthy” is. I think a lot of people don’t really understand macronutrition. BODYSIM helped open my eyes to what I actually need to fuel my body and what’s wrong with a lot of common knowledge about nutrition—it shows you what’s true. \\n![Avatar⟨37⟩]\\nHilary Age 35\\nBODYSIM really helped me manage my hypertension and prediabetes in ways that my GP was very excited about. It not only improved my weight but also my other numbers. \\nThe scans were very informative, and I learned a lot through the process of setting up my goals in BODYSIM—insights I never received from my nutritionist or GP. \\n![Avatar⟨35⟩]\\nJim Age 57\\nI’ve tried most other fitness apps and they were all giving me different results, so nothing was working. Before BODYSIM, I wasn’t getting anywhere on my own. I needed help. \\nBODYSIM helped me figure out my actual macros, and just by making those adjustments, I lost 8 pounds in 4 months. That was my goal, to lose half a pound a week. \\n![Avatar⟨36⟩]\\nStephen Age 39\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\nWe are here to help. \\n###  What do I need to do to reach my peak physical potential through the BODYSIM system?\\nFor BODYSIM to work as designed, you need to feed the model with specific measurements and data points. To get the full BODYSIM experience, you will need to:\\n  * Describe your frame with initial measurements, like height and wrist circumference.\\n  * Get a DEXA scan at a DEXAFit location to baseline your starting muscle, bone and fat composition.\\n  * Complete our baseline at-home blood test to ensure select hormones, diet markers and vitamins/minerals aren’t holding you back.\\n  * Track your daily macros in the BODYSIM app’s food journal.\\n  * Weigh yourself most days on the provided WiFi body composition scale.\\n  * Let the BODYSIM team help you set a body composition goal, such as to lose 5 pounds of fat and gain 10 pounds of muscle over 4 months.\\n  * Let us help you define a diet and exercise plan describing your daily calories, macros, resistance training and cardio.\\n  * Wear a fitness tracker.\\n\\n\\n###  How do I set goals that are personalized to my workout and nutrition regimen?\\nSetting a realistic goal can be hard for two major reasons. First, it’s difficult to set a goal that’s personalized to all the factors of your physiology and metabolism–what’s right for someone else might not be right for your body. Second, there are many different paths to achieving that realistic goal with different levels of pain. Sure, you could lift for 4 hours a day or go on a 1,000-calorie crash diet to get there fast. But is it worth it for you? How high a price are you willing to pay?\\nBODYSIM learns your unique metabolism and physiology so you can set goals that are realistic for your body. It allows you to simulate how different diet and exercise plans would allow you to reach your goals, so you can pick and dial in a plan that works for your body and your life.\\n###  Which smartwatches and activity trackers does BODYSIM integrate with?\\nBODYSIM integrates with any fitness tracker that supports Apple Health. This includes Apple Watch, Garmin watches (Venu, Forerunner, Instinct, Epix and Fenix) and trackers (including Vivosmart), Whoop, Oura and Withings watches.\\nSome BODYSIM users have had difficulty getting Oura rings to track workout heart rates, presumably due to the lack of half ring sizes. We do not recommend purchasing a new Oura ring for BODYSIM unless you already know it is capable of tracking workout heart rates on you. If your Oura ring does track your workout heart rate, it will work with BODYSIM.\\nBODYSIM does NOT support Fitbit or Google Pixel trackers or watches, as these devices do not integrate with Apple Health.\\n###  Do I need to consult with my physician before using BODYSIM?\\nBODYSIM is an informational tool and is not designed to diagnose or treat any disease. BODYSIM results are for informational purposes only and are not intended to replace or substitute for a physician’s medical judgment or to be relied upon as a professional opinion. No communication from BODYSIM is intended to be or should be construed as medical advice. Always consult your physician or medical professional for any medical advice, decision or actions regarding your health care, or when changing your workouts, supplements or diet.\\n###  I have a question that’s not answered here.
