  "generated_description": "**Cleancard: Pioneering At-Home Cancer Detection**\n\nFounded in 2021 and currently part of the Y Combinator Batch S23, Cleancard is a San Francisco-based startup on a mission: to make cancer detection as accessible and simple as taking a pregnancy test. Using the powerful combination of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, Cleancard is redefining the landscape of diagnostics.\n\nTheir core innovation lies in a novel method that allows for robust diagnostics and biomarker tracking using urine samples. This technology aims to put lab-grade diagnostics right in the comfort of your home. Imagine being able to conduct a fully at-home cancer test in just 30 minutes—this is not science fiction; it’s what Cleancard is working towards.\n\nWith a small but focused team of ten employees, Cleancard is rapidly expanding the range of conditions that can be detected from a single sample, pushing the boundaries of what we consider possible in the realm of healthcare. Their approach harnesses cutting-edge technology in artificial intelligence and computer vision, firmly placing them at the intersection of biotech and healthcare innovation.\n\nIf you're intrigued and want to learn more, you can visit their website at [Cleancard.bio](https://www.cleancard.bio) or reach out directly at contact@cleancard.bio. The team is eager to share their journey and innovations that could eventually transform cancer diagnostics globally."
