Regatta supports up to 10 GiB/s of total throughput from all connected file system clients.\\n#####  How does Regatta compare to S3FS? \\nS3FS, and other S3 file system views (including Goofys, S3A, and Mountpoint for Amazon S3) only support a small number of file operations, and many applications (such as logging, or model building) are not supported. Regatta supports all file functionality and is compatible with all POSIX file applications.\\n#####  How does Regatta compare to ObjectiveFS? \\nObjectiveFS is not designed to be used with existing S3 buckets, and isn’t optimized for use with multi-instance workloads. You can’t access data written using ObjectiveFS from the S3 API natively. Regatta uses centralized caching across all instances so that file system updates are available instantly to all clients, and is designed to work with the data that you’ve already stored in S3 object storage.\\n## Savings Calculator\\nFind out how much you can save by switching to Regatta.\\n## Stop thinking about disks\\nGet started today with Regatta, and you won’t have to think about data transfer or disk capacity again.\\n[ Try it Now ](https://regattastorage.com/<https:/console.regattastorage.com>)\\n![](https://regattastorage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/regatta-text-light.png)\\n[ ![](https://regattastorage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tan.png) ](https://regattastorage.com/<https:/www.ycombinator.com/companies/regatta-storage>)\\n  * sales@regattastorage.com\\n\\n\\n[ Linkedin ](https://regattastorage.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/regatta-storage>)\\n###### Company\\n  * [ Overview ](https://regattastorage.com/<#>)\\n  * [ Pricing ](https://regattastorage.com/<#pricing>)\\n\\n\\n###### Product\\n  * [ Careers ](https://regattastorage.com/<#>)\\n  * [ What\\'s New ](https://regattastorage.com/</new>)\\n\\n\\n###### Legal\\n  * [ Terms ](https://regattastorage.com/</terms>)\\n  * [ Privacy Policy ](https://regattastorage.com/<https:/www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/83279401>)\\n  * [ Cookies ](https://regattastorage.com/<#>)\\n\\n\\n  * [ © Regatta Storage Inc 2024.

  "generated_description": "**Regatta Storage: Transforming Data Access for AI and Beyond**\n\nFounded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch F24, Regatta Storage is a San Francisco-based startup that’s making waves in the cloud storage landscape. The mission is straightforward yet powerful—transform Amazon S3 storage into a local file system that is not only unlimited but also 30 times faster. This means no more waiting for data transfers, making it ideal for AI, analytics, and serverless applications.\n\n**What Regatta Does**\n\nAt its core, Regatta Storage provides a seamless connection between your applications and substantial datasets in S3. This translates to instant access without the delays and performance issues commonly associated with cloud storage. Researchers and developers can effortlessly manage large data sets and version control without fear of running out of disk space.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n1. **Blazing Fast Performance**: Regatta offers sub-millisecond access speeds—30x faster than traditional S3 access. This dramatic increase in performance is a game changer, especially for applications that demand quick data retrieval.\n\n2. **Infinite Scalability**: Forget about provisioning storage or dealing with sharding and volume management. With Regatta, your data storage can infinitely scale to meet the demands of your applications.\n\n3. **POSIX Compliance**: It operates just like a regular file system, perfectly compatible with existing applications such as Pandas, PyTorch, and Spark, eliminating the need for code changes.\n\n4. **Ease of Use**: Developers can mount Regatta and point their applications directly to it, enabling immediate performance enhancements without diving deep into configuration.\n\n5. **Flexibility and Control**: Users only pay for what they use, and their data remains in their S3 bucket—a fail-safe against vendor lock-in.\n\n**The Team and Support**\n\nRegatta Storage is structured lean with a team of three and is guided by Group Partner Nicolas Dessaigne. This agility allows for rapid iteration and responsiveness to user needs.\n\n**Pricing Structure**\n\nRegatta employs a usage-based pricing model, starting at $0.05 per gigabyte transferred, making it accessible for startups and scalable for larger enterprises. There are additional costs for high-speed caching and supplementary file systems.\n\n**Future Aspirations**\n\nAs they gear up for a rebranding to capture their expanding capabilities, the excitement around Regatta Storage is palpable. They aim to redefine what cloud-based data management can achieve, especially as AI continues to demand faster and more reliable data access.\n\nFor developers and researchers looking to harness the power of their data without the traditional overhead, Regatta Storage is certainly worth a look.\n\nFor more information, you can visit [Regatta Storage's official website](https://regattastorage.com)."
