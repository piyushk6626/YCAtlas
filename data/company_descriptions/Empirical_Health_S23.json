  "generated_description": "**Empirical Health: Revolutionizing Primary Care with AI**\n\nFounded in 2022 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch S23, Empirical Health is a New York-based startup that’s shaking up the healthcare landscape. With a mission to provide proactive primary care powered by AI, they focus on managing chronic conditions and optimizing the patient experience under value-based care payment models.\n\n### What They Do\nEmpirical Health integrates artificial intelligence to streamline healthcare resource allocation and triage, which is essential in today's complex medical environment. They make healthcare feel less like a chore and more like a partnership. With their app, users can track health metrics, receive personalized care plans, and connect with board-certified doctors—all from the comfort of their homes.\n\n### Services Offered\n- **Wearable Data Integration**: Empirical Health uses data from devices like the Apple Watch to monitor health metrics, enabling patients to take a more active role in managing their health.\n- **Custom Care Plans**: Through generative AI, Empirical Health analyzes biometric data to create tailored care plans, fitting for various complexities of health conditions.\n- **Traditional Care With a Twist**: While modern tech is at the forefront, they ensure that users receive conventional healthcare solutions alongside digital advancements.\n\n### Getting Started\nThe process to join Empirical Health’s ecosystem is refreshingly simple:\n1. **Download the App**: Create an account and link your wearable devices.\n2. **Receive a Personalized Plan**: Your health data informs a customized care strategy.\n3. **Meet Your Doctor**: Schedule a consultation via the app.\n4. **Follow Up Easily**: Chat with your doctor about your healthcare journey.\n\nCurrently, their services are available in 30 US states and they accept a variety of health insurance plans, including Aetna and Medicare (in Florida).

Their insight into patient care paired with cutting-edge technology positions them as a key player in the rapidly evolving telehealth landscape.\n\n### Why It Matters\nEmpirical Health understands that 99% of a person's health is influenced by factors outside the doctor's office. By focusing on holistic care that revolves around the individual, they are not just another telehealth service; they’re reimagining how proactive healthcare should feel.\n\nTo find out more or schedule an appointment, visit their [website](https://empirical.health).
