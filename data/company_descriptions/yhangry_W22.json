served\\nKittie\\nBooked Mario for my mums birthday as a surprise and had an amazing experience. Mario‚Äôs food tasted spectacular!! He catered to my picky little sister too which I really appreciated. He kept the kitchen spotless and took as many pictures and videos as we wanted. So grateful to Mario for making my mums day so special, highly recommend Mario!!\\nJoanni\\nChef Kasae went above and beyond expectations! This is our first time hiring a private chef and wow, there aren‚Äôt any words to describe how truly fantastic this experience was. The food was incredible, and so flavourful, quite literally the best food we have ever tasted. Chef Kasae was so engaging, the perfect amount and we enjoyed spending our evening with her and her assistant chef! A truly unforgettable experience!\\nSam\\nWe had a lovely evening with Davide. The food was amazing and the whole experience was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend.\\nSol\\nWe were a party of 8 and we found the experience to be absolutely perfect! We spoke about the style of evening whether it would be formal or a chilled vibe which Abhilasha catered for and the timings between courses were perfect. Before each course you were transported to an area of the country and given an insight as to how this was created‚Ä¶.. and the food was show stopping. Having everyone finish their meals and be full the portions were healthy and not one person went hungry.\\nKate\\nAndy and his colleague were a great addition to our few days away. They cooked exactly what we wanted, as well as a few extras, with plenty for leftovers too! Absolutely loved it. Created a really good mix of food with fresh ingredients, catering for all needs. Wanted a chilled experience and it‚Äôs exactly what we got, as well as being very professional. Thanks so much again!\\nRon\\nGreat Experience! Thank you guys\\nNaveen\\nFabio was brilliant from start to finish. Communication was excellent, we were given different options and then soon agreed on the menu for guests to choose from 2 dishes. As we were staying in an Airbnb he spend some time to work his way around the kitchen and managed to prepare and cook everything seamlessly. All 3 courses were cooked to perfection, very tasty and nice balance of flavours. All around amazing first private chef experience for us to enjoy for a 30th birthday.\\nSue\\nWe had a lovely evening food was amazing and everyone enjoyed the experience. Sam was very good with children who asked him lots of questions. He was very tidy while cooking and the kitchen was clean and tidy when he finished.\\n## Here is a little bit about Yhangry üíÅ\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è\\n### We\\'ve got you covered\\nWe are trusted by 40,000+ diners in the UK üôå\\n  * Vetted and rated professional chefs\\n  * Secure payment & protection\\n  * Public liability insurance cover\\n  * Flexible cancellation policy\\n  * Dedicated customer support\\n\\n\\n### Trusted by celebrities\\nWe are trusted by celebrity customers and chefs\\n  * Cristiano Ronaldo\\n  * Halle Berry\\n  * Sonam Kapoor\\n  * Made in Chelsea Cast\\n  * & more\\n\\n\\n### Funded by\\nThe same peeps who funded Airbnb, Instacart etc. You\\'re in good hands!\\n  *   *   * \\n\\n## Here is a little bit about Yhangry üíÅ\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è\\n### We\\'ve got you covered\\nWe are trusted by 40,000+ diners in the UK üôå\\n  * Vetted and rated professional chefs\\n  * Secure payment & protection\\n  * Public liability insurance cover\\n  * Flexible cancellation policy\\n  * Dedicated customer support\\n\\n\\n### Trusted by celebrities\\nWe are trusted by celebrity customers and chefs\\n  * Cristiano Ronaldo\\n  * Halle Berry\\n  * Sonam Kapoor\\n  * Made in Chelsea Cast\\n  * & more\\n\\n\\n### Funded by\\nThe same peeps who funded Airbnb, Instacart etc. You\\'re in good hands!\\n  *   *   * \\n\\n## Why hire private chef for your event with yhangry\\n### Vetted and rated professional chefs\\nWe work with the best chefs and we make choosing the right chef easy by providing transparent ratings and reviews by real customers.\\n### Secure payment & protection\\nAt Yhangry, all payments are securely held in escrow until after your event.

Mario‚Äôs food tasted spectacular!! He catered to my picky little sister too which I really appreciated. He kept the kitchen spotless and took as many pictures and videos as we wanted. So grateful to Mario for making my mums day so special, highly recommend Mario!!\\nJoanni\\nChef Kasae went above and beyond expectations! This is our first time hiring a private chef and wow, there aren‚Äôt any words to describe how truly fantastic this experience was. The food was incredible, and so flavourful, quite literally the best food we have ever tasted. Chef Kasae was so engaging, the perfect amount and we enjoyed spending our evening with her and her assistant chef! A truly unforgettable experience!\\nSam\\nWe had a lovely evening with Davide. The food was amazing and the whole experience was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend.\\nSol\\nWe were a party of 8 and we found the experience to be absolutely perfect! We spoke about the style of evening whether it would be formal or a chilled vibe which Abhilasha catered for and the timings between courses were perfect. Before each course you were transported to an area of the country and given an insight as to how this was created‚Ä¶.. and the food was show stopping. Having everyone finish their meals and be full the portions were healthy and not one person went hungry.\\nKate\\nAndy and his colleague were a great addition to our few days away. They cooked exactly what we wanted, as well as a few extras, with plenty for leftovers too! Absolutely loved it. Created a really good mix of food with fresh ingredients, catering for all needs. Wanted a chilled experience and it‚Äôs exactly what we got, as well as being very professional. Thanks so much again!\\nRon\\nGreat Experience! Thank you guys\\nNaveen\\nFabio was brilliant from start to finish. Communication was excellent, we were given different options and then soon agreed on the menu for guests to choose from 2 dishes. As we were staying in an Airbnb he spend some time to work his way around the kitchen and managed to prepare and cook everything seamlessly. All 3 courses were cooked to perfection, very tasty and nice balance of flavours. All around amazing first private chef experience for us to enjoy for a 30th birthday.\\nSue\\nWe had a lovely evening food was amazing and everyone enjoyed the experience. Sam was very good with children who asked him lots of questions. He was very tidy while cooking and the kitchen was clean and tidy when he finished.\\n## Here is a little bit about Yhangry üíÅ\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è\\n### We\\'ve got you covered\\nWe are trusted by 40,000+ diners in the UK üôå\\n  * Vetted and rated professional chefs\\n  * Secure payment & protection\\n  * Public liability insurance cover\\n  * Flexible cancellation policy\\n  * Dedicated customer support\\n\\n\\n### Trusted by celebrities\\nWe are trusted by celebrity customers and chefs\\n  * Cristiano Ronaldo\\n  * Halle Berry\\n  * Sonam Kapoor\\n  * Made in Chelsea Cast\\n  * & more\\n\\n\\n### Funded by\\nThe same peeps who funded Airbnb, Instacart etc. You\\'re in good hands!\\n  *   *   * \\n\\n## Here is a little bit about Yhangry üíÅ\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è\\n### We\\'ve got you covered\\nWe are trusted by 40,000+ diners in the UK üôå\\n  * Vetted and rated professional chefs\\n  * Secure payment & protection\\n  * Public liability insurance cover\\n  * Flexible cancellation policy\\n  * Dedicated customer support\\n\\n\\n### Trusted by celebrities\\nWe are trusted by celebrity customers and chefs\\n  * Cristiano Ronaldo\\n  * Halle Berry\\n  * Sonam Kapoor\\n  * Made in Chelsea Cast\\n  * & more\\n\\n\\n### Funded by\\nThe same peeps who funded Airbnb, Instacart etc. You\\'re in good hands!\\n  *   *   * \\n\\n## Why hire private chef for your event with yhangry\\n### Vetted and rated professional chefs\\nWe work with the best chefs and we make choosing the right chef easy by providing transparent ratings and reviews by real customers.\\n### Secure payment & protection\\nAt Yhangry, all payments are securely held in escrow until after your event.

  "generated_description": "**Yhangry: A New Way to Dine at Home**\n\nFounded in 2020 and rocking the Y Combinator Batch W22, Yhangry is based in London, UK. It‚Äôs not just another food delivery service; it‚Äôs a private chef marketplace that has made it effortless to book a talented chef right to your home for various occasions.\n\n**The Concept**: Yhangry offers a seamless solution to anyone wanting to socialise over a home-cooked meal. For approximately $40 per person, patrons can secure a three-course feast‚Äîwith minimal clicks. Think of it as taking the restaurant experience up a notch: instead of navigating crowded spaces, you get fine dining in the comfort of your own home. \n\nOn the flip side, it‚Äôs a lucrative path for chefs. Yhangry helps culinary professionals earn up to three times more than typical restaurant roles, creating a win-win scenario.\n\n**How it Works**:\n1. **Personalised Experience**: Users specify their preferences, vibe, and budget. \n2. **Curated Quotes**: Within about 20 minutes, clients receive tailored menus and quotes from various chefs.\n3. **Customisation**: After booking, customers can still tweak their menus through direct chats with their chef.\n\n**Diverse Offerings**: The platform is a treasure trove for food lovers. Whether you're hosting a birthday party, wedding, or a casual get-together, the chefs create bespoke menus tailored to individual tastes. The options range from vegan meals, international cuisines, fine dining experiences, to kid-friendly menus‚Äîthere‚Äôs something for every palate.\n\n**Why Choose Yhangry?**\n- **Vetted and Rated Chefs**: Each chef comes with a transparent rating and review system, ensuring quality.\n- **Secure Payment**: All payments are safely held until the event, minimising risk.\n- **Insurance**: Public liability insurance covers any mishaps during the chef‚Äôs service.\n- **Flexible Policies**: Yhangry offers easy cancellation procedures and a dedicated support team.\n\nWith a team of 12, under the guidance of Group Partner Michael Seibel, and a growing clientele of over 40,000 customers, Yhangry is on a mission to redefine dining experiences‚Äîone event at a time.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking to explore this marketplace or need a private chef for your next gathering, head over to [Yhangry‚Äôs Website](http://www.yhangry.com).
