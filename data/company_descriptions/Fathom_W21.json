So I like how quickly the recording becomes available as soon as the meeting has ended. Also, I can go back to the recording and add some insights/ mark a portion of the call where there are action items. Very nice when we are collaborating ideas with the team or with someone who was not able to join the call.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nStephanie Villaver\\n5/5\\n##### \"So simple with all the functionality you need\"\\nSuper easy to use.

During a strategy session with a client, I often come across things that I need to do, or things that the account manager or client need to do. Using the customized options for quickly noting these parts of the meeting - with just a single click - has been SO helpful! I no longer have to switch to a different view to make note of the action item.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nBeth Kocol\\n5/5\\n##### \"Seamless, Effortless, and Extremely Convenient\"\\nFathom allows me to concentrate on HOW people communicate and less on WHAT people communicate. As a performance coach this is vital. I can always go back and check the video/transcript/summary to get into the details. The integration with zoom is easy to use. The custom buttons to mark sections and highlight convos are easy and convinient. I think the best part for me is the monolog meter. This tells me if I\\'m talking too much. It is like Fathos was built for my needs.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nLuke Crane\\n5/5\\n##### \"A Lifesaver for Productive Meetings - Simple, Intuitive, and Empowering\"\\nImagine having a personal assistant who is attentive, diligent, and perfectly accurate all the time - that\\'s Fathom for you.

This app has truly been a game changer for me when it comes to transcribing and recording Zoom snippets. Not only is the interface super user-friendly and easy to navigate, but the transcription feature is spot on. I mean, it\\'s almost like having a personal secretary!\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nJoel Hauer\\n5/5\\n##### \"Valuable and Powerful Tool\"\\nI\\'ve been using Fathom for several months, and it\\'s a game-changer.

I have recommended it to countless people.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nRyan Miller\\n5/5\\n##### \"Has saved me hundreds of hours of time and energy over the past 3 weeks\"\\nI\\'m not tech savvy.

I love receiving an immediate (and accurate) transcription along with video recording. This has significantly increased my presence and focus while in session since I do not need to take notes. I have also saved time and energy by taking the golden nuggets from sessions and converting them into case studies and marketing content.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nKeisha Dixon\\n5/5\\n##### \"The Best AI Assistant for Your Meetings\"\\nFathom does so much more than just transcribe your meetings. It has a control panel that you can view like a sidebar during your meetings, so you can tell it that you want to \"highlight\" what you are talking about or mark it as an \"action item\".

The most valuable part of Fathom for us is the ability to look through the transcription, locate an area of the meeting we want to review, click on that transcription and the video automatically goes to that location to be played.

Fathom has far better features and a streamlined UI/UX that\\'s on point.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nMichelle B. Griffin\\n5/5\\n##### \"For Zoom meetings, consider Fathom a godsend ... or at least your very attentive employee.\"\\nFathom launches automatically for each and every Zoom call. There is no need to remember to turn it on or launch it. Start your Zoom meeting and there is ... showing up barely seconds after you start your meeting. It listens attentively and captures every single word whilst correctly attributing it to the right person who spoke. Within a minute or two after your meeting ends, your entire transcript is sitting there in the cloud.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nNicklaus D\\'Cruz\\n5/5\\n##### \"Instant, accurate transcriptions of all my calls -- game changer!\"\\nWith Fathom, I get top-quality transcripts for free -- instantly.

My favorite feature is the instant summary you can download to Notion. It includes a summary, call highlights and next steps, it\\'s amazing! PLUS each bulleted item is hyperlinked to the section in the recording where it\\'s talked about. I LOVE THIS APP.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nTiffany Frey\\n5/5\\n##### \"A gamechanging meeting capture tool\"\\nThe ability to streamline notetaking and capture of all the needed action items from a meeting is amazing. It has saved us so much time since typing out all the meeting notes during meetings, then going back and trying to create tasks from them.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nMark Howells\\n5/5\\n##### \"Big Thumbs Up for Fathom!\"\\nThe Transcript and summary are fantastic and got me interested.

They make sending meeting recaps and assigning action items a breeze. Another great feature is their direct integration with Hubspot. It will automatically tie the recording, highlights and summary directly to the company and contact card of the attendees.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nChris Flook\\n5/5\\n## Never take notes again\\n[Get Started - Free Forever](https://fathom.video/</users/sign_up>)\\n\ud83d\udd25 Yes, it\u2019s really free!

We offer a Premium version of Fathom that includes advanced AI features like AI-generated action items and 12 different meeting summary templates. We also offer [Fathom Team Edition](https://fathom.video/</for/teams>) that is designed to provide additional features for teams and managers that use Fathom.\\n#### Who has access to my recordings?\\nAll recordings created with Fathom are 100% private. They can only be seen if you share your recordings or highlights with others.\\n#### Is Fathom secure?\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/faq/vanta.svg) ![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/faq/zoom.png)\\nYes. Fathom is hosted and developed following security best practices including end-to-end encryption, robust monitoring, and regular 3rd party penetration testing. Fathom has completed a SOC2 Type 2 audit as well as extensive security review by Zoom as part of being a Zoom Apps Launch Partner. Full details at [trust.fathom.video](https://fathom.video/<https:/trust.fathom.video/>)\\n#### Should I be concerned about my privacy?\\nWe take privacy seriously. We\u2019ve gone out of our way to eliminate 3rd party cookies and forced our legal team to write a terms of service and privacy policy that can be understood without a law degree.\\n#### Will people be uncomfortable with recording Zoom calls?\\nIf you\\'ve not recorded calls before we\\'ve found that you\\'re much more likely to worry about this than your attendees ever will. In fact, inside of certain roles like Sales & Customer Success already over 90% of calls are recorded (with the exceptions typically being sensitive legal or enterprise sales).\\nWe\\'ve also seen that over 50% of attendees would like access to the call recording, so rather than be worried they\\'ll be excited that you\\'re recording the call for their benefit as well (don\\'t worry, Fathom allows you to share the call recording without sharing your highlights & notes).\\nFinally, if at any time your attendees are uncomfortable, Fathom gives you a way to pause recording.\\nGot more questions?
