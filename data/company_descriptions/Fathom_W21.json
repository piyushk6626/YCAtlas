Using the customized options for quickly noting these parts of the meeting - with just a single click - has been SO helpful! I no longer have to switch to a different view to make note of the action item.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nBeth Kocol\\n5/5\\n##### \"Seamless, Effortless, and Extremely Convenient\"\\nFathom allows me to concentrate on HOW people communicate and less on WHAT people communicate. As a performance coach this is vital. I can always go back and check the video/transcript/summary to get into the details. The integration with zoom is easy to use. The custom buttons to mark sections and highlight convos are easy and convinient. I think the best part for me is the monolog meter. This tells me if I\\'m talking too much. It is like Fathos was built for my needs.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nLuke Crane\\n5/5\\n##### \"A Lifesaver for Productive Meetings - Simple, Intuitive, and Empowering\"\\nImagine having a personal assistant who is attentive, diligent, and perfectly accurate all the time - that\\'s Fathom for you.

I love receiving an immediate (and accurate) transcription along with video recording. This has significantly increased my presence and focus while in session since I do not need to take notes. I have also saved time and energy by taking the golden nuggets from sessions and converting them into case studies and marketing content.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nKeisha Dixon\\n5/5\\n##### \"The Best AI Assistant for Your Meetings\"\\nFathom does so much more than just transcribe your meetings.

The most valuable part of Fathom for us is the ability to look through the transcription, locate an area of the meeting we want to review, click on that transcription and the video automatically goes to that location to be played.

We offer a Premium version of Fathom that includes advanced AI features like AI-generated action items and 12 different meeting summary templates. We also offer [Fathom Team Edition](https://fathom.video/</for/teams>) that is designed to provide additional features for teams and managers that use Fathom.\\n#### Who has access to my recordings?\\nAll recordings created with Fathom are 100% private. They can only be seen if you share your recordings or highlights with others.\\n#### Is Fathom secure?\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/faq/vanta.svg) ![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/faq/zoom.png)\\nYes.

Full details at [trust.fathom.video](https://fathom.video/<https:/trust.fathom.video/>)\\n#### Should I be concerned about my privacy?\\nWe take privacy seriously. We’ve gone out of our way to eliminate 3rd party cookies and forced our legal team to write a terms of service and privacy policy that can be understood without a law degree.\\n#### Will people be uncomfortable with recording Zoom calls?\\nIf you\\'ve not recorded calls before we\\'ve found that you\\'re much more likely to worry about this than your attendees ever will. In fact, inside of certain roles like Sales & Customer Success already over 90% of calls are recorded (with the exceptions typically being sensitive legal or enterprise sales).\\nWe\\'ve also seen that over 50% of attendees would like access to the call recording, so rather than be worried they\\'ll be excited that you\\'re recording the call for their benefit as well (don\\'t worry, Fathom allows you to share the call recording without sharing your highlights & notes).\\nFinally, if at any time your attendees are uncomfortable, Fathom gives you a way to pause recording.\\nGot more questions?

As a performance coach this is vital. I can always go back and check the video/transcript/summary to get into the details. The integration with zoom is easy to use.

Where has this been my whole life?!\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nLeah Shapiro\\n5/5\\n##### \"An essential part of our toolkit\"\\nFathom is an exceptionally fast and reliable AI driven Zoom call recording (you can see the recorded meeting and transcription immediately, pretty much). It has a remarkably accurate AI created meeting summary. It\\'s pretty spooky how accurate and useful this feature is, saves us loads of time.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nChristopher Bradford\\n5/5\\n##### \"Best app in zoom hands down 🏆\"\\nIt\\'s such an amazing backup as I forgot to hit record on a podcast on Zoom and fathom was recording and the video was actually better than the Zoom video. What a lifesaver. Best tool ever for time, backup and note taking!\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nJen Vazquez\\n5/5\\n##### \"Game changer. The most accurate transcription service for recorded video I have ever used\"\\nThe accuracy of the transcript saves me hours. It is also a really easy plugin for Zoom, so I can start recording a call as soon as I know it is going to have content I want to share with my team or use to create content for our socials/website.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nMegan Gell\\n5/5\\n##### \"Essential tool for client meetings\"\\nI love the automated transcription and the ability to highlight important comments/topics within a call. Creating tasks with the click of a button. And I can easily review previous meetings when I need to recall important information.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nBill Kerschbaum\\n5/5\\n##### \"Must have for anyone on a lot of video calls\"\\nOne of the most frictionless note-taking apps I\\'ve ever used. If you\\'re taking notes on a call, you\\'re shooting yourself in the foot. Fathom does a spectacular job of providing clear action items and hits that rare SaaS user experience where I forget I\\'m even using a tool.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nAndrew Epps\\n5/5\\n##### \"Once I discovered Fathom, I\\'m no longer using Otter.ai\"\\nFathom makes business communication and meetings easier, period. As an avid fan and long-time Otter.ai user, I couldn\\'t believe there was anything better. Until a friend told me about Fathom. I was skeptical and waited months to use it. She was right. Fathom has far better features and a streamlined UI/UX that\\'s on point.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nMichelle B. Griffin\\n5/5\\n##### \"For Zoom meetings, consider Fathom a godsend ... or at least your very attentive employee.\"\\nFathom launches automatically for each and every Zoom call. There is no need to remember to turn it on or launch it. Start your Zoom meeting and there is ... showing up barely seconds after you start your meeting. It listens attentively and captures every single word whilst correctly attributing it to the right person who spoke. Within a minute or two after your meeting ends, your entire transcript is sitting there in the cloud.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nNicklaus D\\'Cruz\\n5/5\\n##### \"Instant, accurate transcriptions of all my calls -- game changer!\"\\nWith Fathom, I get top-quality transcripts for free -- instantly. That\\'s a massive time and money saver.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nAdam Kirsch\\n5/5\\n##### \"I love Fathom!\"\\nThis app has eliminated the need to take notes during my calls so I can be fully present. My favorite feature is the instant summary you can download to Notion. It includes a summary, call highlights and next steps, it\\'s amazing! PLUS each bulleted item is hyperlinked to the section in the recording where it\\'s talked about. I LOVE THIS APP.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nTiffany Frey\\n5/5\\n##### \"A gamechanging meeting capture tool\"\\nThe ability to streamline notetaking and capture of all the needed action items from a meeting is amazing. It has saved us so much time since typing out all the meeting notes during meetings, then going back and trying to create tasks from them.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nMark Howells\\n5/5\\n##### \"Big Thumbs Up for Fathom!\"\\nThe Transcript and summary are fantastic and got me interested. The Highlight button is becoming my favorite feature. Ease of use, utility and efficiency. It\\'s the best assistant I\\'ve never paid!\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nTrey Pittman\\n5/5\\n##### \"Excellent tool and huge timesaver\"\\nTheir AI summaries are shockingly good. They make sending meeting recaps and assigning action items a breeze. Another great feature is their direct integration with Hubspot. It will automatically tie the recording, highlights and summary directly to the company and contact card of the attendees.\\n![](https://static-landing.fathom.video/d74a77d130863cceaefd416a3a1fb76c82bfea9b/img/customers/photo-2.png)\\nChris Flook\\n5/5\\n## Never take notes again\\nGet Started - Free Forever⟨7⟩\\n🔥 Yes, it’s really free!

Within 30 seconds of a meeting ending, users receive a neatly organized summary, set to sync automatically with their CRM, saving them an average of 20 minutes per meeting.\n\nWith a team of 25, Fathom is positioned as a powerful tool for anyone who relies on video conferencing platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet. The product is versatile, supporting 28 languages and integrating seamlessly with various tools like Slack and Asana, making it an indispensable asset for sales, customer success, operations, and marketing teams alike.\n\nFathom's customer satisfaction is reflected in its impressive net promoter score of 81 and over 4,000 positive reviews, earning it accolades like \"AI Product of the Year\" and making it the top-ranked AI meeting assistant on platforms like G2 and Product Hunt.\n\nFor users interested in exploring Fathom, the app is free for unlimited recording, transcription, and summarization, offering premium features like advanced AI-generated summaries and action item generation at a low cost. The commitment to user privacy and data security is robust; Fathom ensures that all recordings are private and safeguarded by the latest encryption standards.\n\nIn summary, whether you’re managing complex projects, leading sales calls, or coordinating team efforts, Fathom is designed to streamline your workflow, allow for greater engagement in conversations, and transform the way meetings are conducted.
