True partners in hiring! They worked with us to understand our requirements and gave us a pipeline of great engineers. Some of our best engineering hires were brought in by Weekday. Highly recommend them!\"\\n## Frequently asked questions\\nWhile these are some frequently asked questions, feel free to contact us for any follow-up questions\\nHow are you different from any other hiring marketplace like Naukri, Instahyre etc?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c63d9b7dca41affc7eac1b/66c63d9c7dca41affc7eacc9_Plus.svg)\\nMost hiring platforms (with the exception of LinkedIn), only has \"active\" candidates - which is :1. always a very small subset of available candidate pool 2. not necessarily the best people for the job. Weekday and LinkedIn are the only platforms that allow you to reach out all the possible candidate pool.While LinkedIn limits you to communicate only via LinkedIn Messages (ie InMail); Weekday provides email and phone number readily. Which means >50% response rate as opposed <10% on InMail\\nHow are your two operating models different - Autopilot and Subscription?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c63d9b7dca41affc7eac1b/66c63d9c7dca41affc7eacc9_Plus.svg)\\nIn Autopilot model, we take care of your hiring end to end. Our dedicated account manager finds the candidates, reaches out to them and shares only interested candidates with you. You select the ones you want to interview. The account manager again ensures that all rounds of interviews are scheduled without any drop-offs (you would be surprised how many candidates get generally missed/dropped-off because of delays/lapses in interview scheduling; hence we take care of it). In Subscription model, we provide you access to our database, where you can use smart filters on our platform to find the candidates yourself. The ones you \"Show interest\" to - will be emailed, whatsapped and called by Weekday. You get all responses on your mailbox where you can reply yourself and schedule interviews with ones you like.\\nWhy do you charge 15% success fee on your \"Autopilot\" model when other agencies are cheaper?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c63d9b7dca41affc7eac1b/66c63d9c7dca41affc7eacc9_Plus.svg)\\nWell, that\\'s because we are not just another agency. We unlock & discover a completely new set of candidates for you. We have a pool of candidates that no other agency would have access to (as we have almost all of India on our platform to choose from). Our \"Autopilot\" model would make sense for you if you are optimising for quality of talent - which is pretty hard to do via other agencies. \\nI am a candidate looking for a job. I am not a hiring manager. Can I still use Weekday?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c63d9b7dca41affc7eac1b/66c63d9c7dca41affc7eacc9_Plus.svg)\\nYes, ofcourse.

True partners in hiring! They worked with us to understand our requirements and gave us a pipeline of great engineers. Some of our best engineering hires were brought in by Weekday. Highly recommend them!\"\\n## Frequently asked questions\\nWhile these are some frequently asked questions, feel free to contact us for any follow-up questions\\nHow are you different from any other hiring marketplace like Naukri, Instahyre etc?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c63d9b7dca41affc7eac1b/66c63d9c7dca41affc7eacc9_Plus.svg)\\nMost hiring platforms (with the exception of LinkedIn), only has \"active\" candidates - which is :1. always a very small subset of available candidate pool 2. not necessarily the best people for the job. Weekday and LinkedIn are the only platforms that allow you to reach out all the possible candidate pool.While LinkedIn limits you to communicate only via LinkedIn Messages (ie InMail); Weekday provides email and phone number readily. Which means >50% response rate as opposed <10% on InMail\\nHow are your two operating models different - Autopilot and Subscription?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c63d9b7dca41affc7eac1b/66c63d9c7dca41affc7eacc9_Plus.svg)\\nIn Autopilot model, we take care of your hiring end to end. Our dedicated account manager finds the candidates, reaches out to them and shares only interested candidates with you. You select the ones you want to interview. The account manager again ensures that all rounds of interviews are scheduled without any drop-offs (you would be surprised how many candidates get generally missed/dropped-off because of delays/lapses in interview scheduling; hence we take care of it). In Subscription model, we provide you access to our database, where you can use smart filters on our platform to find the candidates yourself. The ones you \"Show interest\" to - will be emailed, whatsapped and called by Weekday. You get all responses on your mailbox where you can reply yourself and schedule interviews with ones you like.\\nWhy do you charge 15% success fee on your \"Autopilot\" model when other agencies are cheaper?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c63d9b7dca41affc7eac1b/66c63d9c7dca41affc7eacc9_Plus.svg)\\nWell, that\\'s because we are not just another agency. We unlock & discover a completely new set of candidates for you. We have a pool of candidates that no other agency would have access to (as we have almost all of India on our platform to choose from). Our \"Autopilot\" model would make sense for you if you are optimising for quality of talent - which is pretty hard to do via other agencies. \\nI am a candidate looking for a job. I am not a hiring manager. Can I still use Weekday?\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66c63d9b7dca41affc7eac1b/66c63d9c7dca41affc7eacc9_Plus.svg)\\nYes, ofcourse.
