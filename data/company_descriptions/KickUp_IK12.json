  "description": "KickUp partners with K-12 organizations to coordinate professional learning efforts, improve decision-making and ensure that great ideas translate into demonstrable outcomes in the classroom.\n\n‚ÄúThe great thing about KickUp is they brought credibility to the professional development work we are doing. It‚Äôs challenging to be a ‚Äòprophet in our own land‚Äô, but having KickUp‚Äôs professional reports presented in clear and compelling ways instantly became a communication tool between our entire curriculum department, the district cabinet, and the school board. I was able to use the resources KickUp created for a board report and now the district is interested in seeing how all of the other departments can benefit from their services. We are in need of someone who can take that step back and see the big picture of what we are trying to accomplish with professional development, effective student learning, and assessment and tie it all together for us in ways that make sense. KickUp has become the connector between departments, helping to lead us all in our common goal, to improve learning for our students.",

  "generated_description": "KickUp is a Philly-based education tech company that's making waves by streamlining professional development for K-12 organizations. While much of their mission details remain under wraps, their initial premise is clear: they're all about improving professional learning efforts in education. Their approach focuses on harnessing data and insights to drive real outcomes in the classroom, helping educators enhance their skills and effectiveness.\n\nWhat sets KickUp apart? The testimonials say it all. Educators have highlighted how useful KickUp‚Äôs professional reports are for communicating critical information across various departmental levels‚Äîfrom curriculum teams to district cabinets and even school boards. This kind of clear communication is crucial when you‚Äôre trying to align everyone towards a common goal of boosting student learning.\n\nFounded as part of Y Combinator's Batch IK12, KickUp has a small but mighty team of nine. They‚Äôre based in Philadelphia, a city with a rich educational landscape.
