They focus on using AI to transform healthcare delivery, making information and evidence-based medicine accessible worldwide. \n\nPamela Fearon, VP of Global Study Operations at BioMarin, summarizes H1's impact perfectly: “Because of the advance of technology platforms, H1 being one of them, we are able to decrease the time it takes for that initial vetting of our sites. And this has proven to be an efficiency gain for us in the clinical operations world.”\n\n**Who Trusts H1?**\n\nOver **250 leading companies**, including giants like **Lilly**, **Sanofi**, and **AstraZeneca**, have placed their trust in H1 to enhance their healthcare strategies and operations. \n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, H1 is not just about connecting healthcare providers with data—it's about building a comprehensive network that ultimately aims to create a healthier future.
