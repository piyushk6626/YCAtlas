Striga's customers include early stage FinTech's, Web3 innovators, Banking Institutions and Crypto Exchanges utilizing services spanning the range of Crypto Custody, Trading, Card Issuing and Banking. Building a crypto business today is a highly regulated space unlike a few years ago and maintaining a compliance program and building technology presents a huge barrier to entry for startups and mid-size businesses alike and the Striga platform solves the problem with a single set of APIs and a single contract to deliver services to 30 countries today.",

Working with bitcoin and playing a European tour with a German band, evidently illustrated the horrors of only legally having access to an Indian bank account but attempting to use multiple currencies on a daily basis, whilst bitcoin was promised to solve this problem. Striga solves this and enables businesses to solve this.\n\nIn my \"free\" time - semi-pro drummer & full time metalhead",
