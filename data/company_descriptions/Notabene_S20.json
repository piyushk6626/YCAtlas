The FATF sets international standards aiming to prevent illegal activities and financial crime. In October 2018, the FATF adopted changes to its recommendations to explicitly clarify that they apply to financial activities involving virtual assets.\\n### What is cryptocurrency & virtual asset compliance?\\nGlobal money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), issued guidance for the virtual asset industry in June 2019, including Recommendation 16, known in the industry as the Crypto Travel Rule. Recommendation 16 requires Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) worldwide to send and store information surrounding the parties of a transaction.\\n### What are the advantages of cryptocurrency & virtual asset compliance?\\nFuture business opportunities after complying with the FinCEN Travel Rule are immense. FATF Travel Rule compliance presents the most significant opportunity for virtual assets to become widely accepted in everyday use cases. Cryptocurrency companies that comply will have better access to traditional banking, which will allow easier access to institutional investors. They will also be able to provide more visibility and trust around each transaction for their customers.\\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e601645c92302d9c7f88fc/63e74397be8e5c13e4bc77e2_notabene-logo.svg)](https://notabene.id/</>)\\nThe Pre-Transaction Decision-Making Platform for Crypto Travel Rule Compliance\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e601645c92302d9c7f88fc/650830e236872ab51d71d775_Group%201087189.webp)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e601645c92302d9c7f88fc/650830e12b33ac9a3fc3b88b_2022-FastCompany_MostInnovativeCompanies_StandardLogo.webp)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e601645c92302d9c7f88fc/65083103687c06809ee3410f_best-solution.webp)\\nProduct\\n[TRAVEL RULE CRYPTO](https://notabene.id/</product-travel-rule>)[CRYPTO WALLET ID](https://notabene.id/</wallet-identification>)[VASP NETWORK](https://notabene.id/<https:/app.notabene.id/network>)[DEVELOPERS](https://notabene.id/<https:/doc.notabene.id/>)[REGULATIONS](https://notabene.id/</regulations>)\\nCompany\\n[ABOUT](https://notabene.id/</about-us>)[JOBS](https://notabene.id/</careers>)[CRYPTO TRAVEL RULE REPORT](https://notabene.id/</state-of-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-report>)[CRYPTO TRAVEL RULE 101 GUIDE](https://notabene.id/</crypto-travel-rule-101/crypto-travel-rule-101>)[TRAINING](https://notabene.id/<https:/academy.notabene.id/app>)[AGREEMENTS](https://notabene.id/</agreements>)\\nSubscribe\\nSubscribe to our product updates, news on crypto regulations and more\\nNameEmail Address\\nThank you!

The FATF sets international standards aiming to prevent illegal activities and financial crime. In October 2018, the FATF adopted changes to its recommendations to explicitly clarify that they apply to financial activities involving virtual assets.\\n### What is cryptocurrency & virtual asset compliance?\\nGlobal money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), issued guidance for the virtual asset industry in June 2019, including Recommendation 16, known in the industry as the Crypto Travel Rule. Recommendation 16 requires Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) worldwide to send and store information surrounding the parties of a transaction.\\n### What are the advantages of cryptocurrency & virtual asset compliance?\\nFuture business opportunities after complying with the FinCEN Travel Rule are immense. FATF Travel Rule compliance presents the most significant opportunity for virtual assets to become widely accepted in everyday use cases. Cryptocurrency companies that comply will have better access to traditional banking, which will allow easier access to institutional investors. They will also be able to provide more visibility and trust around each transaction for their customers.\\n![⟨72⟩](https://notabene.id/</>)\\nThe Pre-Transaction Decision-Making Platform for Crypto Travel Rule Compliance\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e601645c92302d9c7f88fc/650830e236872ab51d71d775_Group%201087189.webp)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e601645c92302d9c7f88fc/650830e12b33ac9a3fc3b88b_2022-FastCompany_MostInnovativeCompanies_StandardLogo.webp)![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e601645c92302d9c7f88fc/65083103687c06809ee3410f_best-solution.webp)\\nProduct\\nTRAVEL RULE CRYPTO⟨73⟩CRYPTO WALLET ID⟨74⟩VASP NETWORK⟨3⟩DEVELOPERS⟨75⟩REGULATIONS⟨76⟩\\nCompany\\nABOUT⟨18⟩JOBS⟨19⟩CRYPTO TRAVEL RULE REPORT⟨77⟩CRYPTO TRAVEL RULE 101 GUIDE⟨15⟩TRAINING⟨22⟩AGREEMENTS⟨78⟩\\nSubscribe\\nSubscribe to our product updates, news on crypto regulations and more\\nNameEmail Address\\nThank you!
