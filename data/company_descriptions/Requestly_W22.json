For anyone who works heavily in development and **testing around web-based environments** , I would recommend that they try this extension.\\n![profile picture⟨78⟩]\\nHarry King-Riches\\nSolutions Engineer @Magnite\\n![Company logo⟨75⟩]\\n★★★★★ on Chrome store\\n**Great tool** and **great support**!\\n![profile picture⟨79⟩]\\nOfer Ohel\\nSenior Software Engineer at HiHello, Inc.\\n![Company logo⟨80⟩]\\n★★★★★ on Chrome store\\nRequestly is an incredibly useful tool for developers **working on a large team** with **multiple staging envs** , or **numerous app endpoints** for various APIs in a local environment. The **Sessions feature** is especially useful for **documenting solutions** or sharing with others since it captures the relevant network traffic, and screen recording enables others to easily reproduce. Requestly combines all the power of complicated tools like **Charles Proxy** and **Postman** in one app/chrome extension. I highly recommend giving it a try if you haven't already–it will make your dev work so much easier. (Summarized)\\n![profile picture⟨52⟩]\\nJoél Hawkins Torres\\nSenior Software Engineer at Autodesk\\n![Company logo⟨81⟩]\\n★★★★★ on Chrome store\\nVery simple to use and super useful! **Great support** too. Thank you!\\n![profile picture⟨82⟩]\\nAlessandra Laderchi from eDreams\\nFrontend Software Engineer at eDreams ODIGEO\\n![Company logo⟨83⟩]\\n★★★★★ on Chrome store\\nJust loved the way Requestly **saved several person hours** for our dev team by allowing us to redirect and intercept requests. The simple yet efficient rules allowed us to seamlessly **redirect requests** from a single **staging front-end server to local backend servers**. This meant that our devs didn't need to build or run the front-end server locally when focusing on backend tasks.\\n![profile picture⟨84⟩]\\nSrijan Bhatnagar\\nSenior Software Engineer at Atlassian\\n![Company logo⟨85⟩]\\n★★★★★ on Chrome store\\nRequestly comes as a savior whenever the Adobe platform debugger shows a glitch in the **launch library override**. I used Requestly for **redirect and mockup file server** and it really helped me in dev and debugging. The interface is easy to use and **creating a rule on one machine and accessing it from different machines** makes it awesome.\\n![profile picture⟨86⟩]\\nPradeep Jaiswal\\nTechnical Lead Consultant ShyftLabs\\n![Company logo⟨87⟩]\\n★★★★★ on Chrome store\\n**Saves me tons of time in development, testing, and diagnostics**.
