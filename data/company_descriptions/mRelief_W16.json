  "generated_description": "mRelief is a nonprofit organization founded in 2014 and based in Chicago, Illinois. It emerged from the need to make signing up for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—commonly known as food stamps—easier for Americans. This mission is particularly critical as many individuals and families navigated the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe organization’s platform is designed to be user-friendly, available both online and via text messaging at 74544. It utilizes public datasets from the USDA to help individuals determine if they may be eligible for SNAP benefits across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. By simplifying what can often be a confusing process, mRelief aims to empower users to access vital food resources.\n\nmRelief is not just about helping individuals fill out forms; it goes further by directing potential SNAP recipients to the best application routes, which often include simplified applications or assistance through community partners. The impact of their work has been profound, with over 4.4 million individuals served and more than $1.75 billion in benefits unlocked for those in need.\n\nWith a modest team of 12 people, mRelief is a part of Y Combinator's Winter 2016 batch, which highlights its innovative approach to social services. Their message is clear: they are on a mission to restore dignity by transforming social support systems and making them more accessible to everyone.\n\nIf you're curious to see if you qualify for SNAP benefits, you can start by visiting their website at [mRelief.com](https://www.mrelief.com) or simply text \"Food\" to 74544 to engage with their eligibility screener directly via message. They've seamlessly blended technology with compassionate support to fill the pantries and fridges of countless households across the nation. It’s a modern solution to an age-old problem, and it’s making a real difference."
