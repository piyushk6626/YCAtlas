  "description": "At Saturn, our mission is to make financial peace of mind more accessible by building the best operating system for wealth managers. \r\n\nWealth and Asset Management is one of the world’s highest revenue-generating industries, yet it remains painfully inefficient. The sector relies heavily on disjointed legacy systems, manual human tasks, and a complex web of intermediaries, all of which increase costs. \r\n\nSaturn is an AI-powered operating system for wealth management built to automate investment research, streamline operations, and ensure compliance. Saturn creates the best version of truth, empowering investment advisors to work more efficiently, navigate complex regulatory landscapes, and deliver personalised, high-value services to their clients.\r\n\nToday, Saturn supports over 200 firms globally that manage more than £35bn in assets under management (AUM) and over 200,000 clients.\r\n\nAs the industry grows, it faces massive operational challenges like bad tech, advisor retirements, regulatory pressure, an increased cost base, and transformational opportunities like great intergenerational wealth transfer and changing consumer needs.\r\n\nSaturn aims to be at the forefront of this transformation, driving the future of wealth management.",

The firm recognizes that the Wealth and Asset Management industry, while lucrative, is riddled with inefficiencies stemming from legacy technology and fragmented processes. \n\n**Key Offerings**  \nAt its core, Saturn is an AI-powered operating system that automates investment research, streamlines operations, and ensures compliance.

However, these hurdles also represent transformational opportunities—a chance for wealth management to evolve.\n\n**Team & Leadership**  \nOperating with a compact team of just **8 employees**, Saturn benefits from the insights of its Group Partner, **Tom Blomfield**, a prominent figure in the fintech realm.\n\n**What They Do**  \nSaturn focuses on blending disparate data through industry-specific integrations. Their standout product, **CoPlanner AI**, is designed to fit the unique needs of financial services, employing advanced technology to ensure compliance and quality in data handling without compromising client security.
