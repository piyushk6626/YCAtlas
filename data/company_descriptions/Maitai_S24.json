  "description": "Maitai makes building reliable AI applications easy. We autocorrect faulty model output in real-time and automatically fine-tune models that learn from their mistakes. This means our customers get more reliable results immediately, and over time, they gain custom models built specifically for their application that only get better and faster. You wouldn’t hire an employee who doesn’t learn from their mistakes—so why use a model that doesn’t? Maitai is here to deliver the next generation of reliable AI inference.",
