  "description": "Expo lets developers write apps that are written in JavaScript and run natively on Android, iOS, and the web. Our cloud services that work with all Expo and React Native apps, named Expo Application Services (EAS), further speeds up teams by helping them get to the app stores as fast as possible and continue growing.\r\n\nWe believe that mobile apps provide a better experience than websites, but making apps is much more difficult than it needs to be. With Expo, we're bringing together the best of the web, like its development speed, fast iteration cycles, easy deploys, and automatic cross-platform support, and the performance, device capabilities, and user experience of native apps.",

With technologies like @reactnative and @expo, literally anyone with an idea can rapidly build their dream app. What a time to be alive!\\n![Mat Warger\\'s avatar⟨47⟩]\\nMat Warger\\n@mwarger\\nI don\\'t know who needs to hear this but @expo is the future.\\n![William Candillon\\'s avatar⟨48⟩]\\nWilliam Candillon\\n@wcandillon\\nThe speed at which React Native Web via @expo has evolved in the past 6 months is absolutely wild. My head is spinning.\\n![Trevor Hartman\\'s avatar⟨49⟩]\\nTrevor Hartman\\n@devth\\nExpo recently made it possible to target web, so you can write a single UI for native and web. I’m continually impressed. Otherwise next.js by @zeithq is incredible. Both of these projects have amazing docs, DX, and fast release cycles.\\n![Jamon Holmgren\\'s avatar⟨50⟩]\\nJamon Holmgren\\n@jamonholmgren\\nSo @expo’s over the air update feature just saved us on launch day (yes, Friday, sorry). We had a crash happening on a critical path (didn’t happen in dev testing) but narrowed it down and deployed a fix using OTA in about an hour.\\n![Annie Elequin\\'s avatar⟨51⟩]\\nAnnie Elequin\\n@AnnieElequin\\n@expo made notifications so easy, I almost cried tears of joy 😭 using expo is just a delightful experience\\n![Ryan Baldwin\\'s avatar⟨52⟩]\\nRyan Baldwin\\n@bakerofbytes\\nIt’s difficult to make a tool that is powerful, easy to use, and stays out of the way. @expo has figured it out and it’s one of the most pleasurable dev experiences I’ve had in my career.\\n![Casey Li\\'s avatar⟨53⟩]\\nCasey Li\\n@caseyli23\\nI love how @expo allows me to build my standalone apps remotely on their much more powerful servers! Saves time and allows me to continue to use my computer while I wait for the build!\\n![The Big Red Geek\\'s avatar⟨54⟩]\\nThe Big Red Geek\\n@thebigredgeek\\nI think @expo is one of the most beautiful ****ing pieces of engineering I’ve seen in a very long time\\n![Tyler H\\'s avatar⟨55⟩]\\nTyler H\\n@Ipse_dixt_T\\nArkansas Western District Court uses expo web. I chose @expo because it was the fastest way for a single developer to achieve our mandate—mobile/desktop/web.\\n## Upgrade your team’s workflowand iterate with stability.\\nSign Up⟨7⟩\\n![pattern⟨56⟩]\\n## Want to learn more?\\nRead the docs⟨1⟩\\nJoin the community⟨57⟩\\nUse our tools⟨2⟩\\nRead our blog⟨58⟩\\nProduct\\n  * Star us on GitHub⟨6⟩\\n  * Expo CLI on GitHub⟨59⟩\\n  * EAS⟨3⟩\\n  * EAS CLI on GitHub⟨60⟩\\n  * Expo Go⟨61⟩\\n  * Expo Orbit⟨62⟩\\n  * Snack⟨63⟩\\n\\n\\nResources\\n  * Docs⟨64⟩\\n  * Blog⟨58⟩\\n  * Changelog⟨9⟩\\n  * Newsletter⟨65⟩\\n  * Support⟨66⟩\\n  * Trust Center⟨67⟩\\n  * Join Discord⟨57⟩\\n\\n\\nCompany\\n  * Homepage⟨68⟩\\n  * Pricing⟨4⟩\\n  * Customers⟨10⟩\\n  * About⟨69⟩\\n  * Branding⟨70⟩\\n  * Work at Expo⟨5⟩\\n\\n\\nLegal\\n  * Terms of service⟨71⟩\\n  * Fair use policy⟨72⟩\\n  * Privacy policy⟨73⟩\\n  * Privacy explained⟨74⟩\\n  * Security & Compliance⟨75⟩\\n  * Community guidelines⟨76⟩\\n\\n\\n[](https://expo.dev/</>)\\n[](https://expo.dev/<https:/www.github.com/expo/expo> \"GitHub\")[](https://expo.dev/<https:/www.twitter.com/expo> \"X\")[](https://expo.dev/<https:/chat.expo.dev> \"Discord\")[](https://expo.dev/<https:/bsky.app/profile/expo.dev> \"Bluesky\")\\nCopyright © 2025 650 Industries, Inc.
