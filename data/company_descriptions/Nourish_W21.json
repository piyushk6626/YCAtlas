  "generated_description": "Nourish is an innovative company founded in 2021, located in New York, and one of the notable startups from Y Combinator's W21 batch. Its mission is straightforward yet impactful: to address America's healthcare crisis by making nutrition accessible through telehealth dietitian services that are covered by insurance. This approach connects patients with chronic conditions to Registered Dietitians (RDs), enabling them to get the nutrition therapy they need without the burden of out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nThe company operates with a relatively compact but dedicated team of 38 employees, led by their group partner, Jared Friedman. Nourish touts an impressive statistic: approximately 94% of their patients pay $0 out of pocket for services, which speaks volumes about their commitment to a stress-free, transparent billing process. They’re able to achieve this through partnerships with major insurance providers across all 50 states, making access to professional nutrition guidance as seamless as possible.\n\nNourish has built a user-friendly platform where clients can find dietitians, schedule appointments, and manage their health goals—all via a convenient mobile app. Patients undergo a comprehensive nutrition assessment in their first session, during which their dietitian evaluates their health goals to design a personalized care plan. Follow-ups include actionable coaching and progress tracking, ensuring support is available at every stage of the health journey.\n\nThe company emphasizes evidence-based care, resulting in tangible improvements—91% of patients report overall health improvements, and 82% meet their primary health goals. They're not just about nutritional advice; Nourish takes a holistic view of health, considering factors like sleep, exercise, and mental well-being. Their app also offers additional resources, including meal planning and curated content, further enriching the user experience.\n\nAs they aim to help millions embrace healthier lifestyles, Nourish's clear vision, innovative model, and commitment to service position them as a significant player in the consumer health space. If you’re looking to explore health improvements through diet, check out their website at [usenourish.com](https://usenourish.com)."
