"Rocketable has the headline ""The AI maximalist software holding company."" Description of Rocketable is ""Rocketable is building a large portfolio of wildly profitable software businesses by acquiring existing products and replacing human teams with AI agents.

Today’s foundation models already possess enough intelligence to automate most of the tasks required to run a profitable software business. In the functions where agents aren’t yet intelligent enough to replace humans, they will be soon.

When every human function required to operate a software product has an AI agent equivalent, the next step will be within reach: operating an entire company with a team of AI agents instead of humans.

But superintelligent agents within each function won’t be enough. To operate a software company with 0 human employees, the agents will need to be directed towards common goals, integrated to collaborate across functions, tuned with feedback loops connected to product metrics, and trained to make resource allocation decisions.

We are creating the tools needed to replace the entire org chart of a software company with a team of AI agents.

Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.

Existing marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint’s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.

Building these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.

This synthesis allows Misprint to effectively bridge the valuation gap that many collectors face.

The creation of these pricing models is not trivial; it necessitates a comprehensive data infrastructure, significant industry expertise, and the latest advancements in machine learning. Observations from recent surges in the trading card market indicate a strong demand among collectors for transparent and trustworthy valuations.

"Mesh has the headline ""Automate outsourced accounting work with AI."" Description of Mesh is ""Mesh builds domain-specific AI agents to automate repetitive accounting tasks like cash reconciliation, expense wires, and inter-company transactions. Whatever tasks accounting firms are currently outsourcing abroad for reduced labor costs, we automate entirely.

At Carta, we spent 5+ years working together to automate accounting. We helped grow Carta's fund accounting business from $20M to $100M, transformed offline excel tasks into automated workflows, and increased customer satisfaction score by over 50% by creating an internal workspace for task coordination. 

Until now, the only way to scale accounting firms was to hire more employees and outsource more work. With Mesh, accountants can save time on each task, save money on hiring additional resources, and use their extra capacity to exponentially grow their business.

With a current shortage of 340,000 accountants in the US, along with the alarming statistic that 75% of certified public accountants (CPAs) will reach retirement within the next 15 years, AI has a critical role to play. And we want to be the ones to automate this $63bn outsourced accounting and finance industry.

Our AI agents work long hours, so accountants don't need to.."" Website: http://www.usemesh.com. It is part of the W25 batch, founded on 2024 with a team of 2 based in San Francisco. The Group Partner is Michael Seibel.","The headline ""Automate outsourced accounting work with AI"" encapsulates an ambitious vision. Mesh focuses on creating specialized AI agents designed to eliminate repetitive tasks in the accounting realm, such as cash reconciliation, expense wires, and inter-company transactions. The current landscape sees many accounting firms sending their tasks overseas to cut costs; Mesh offers a solution that automates these processes entirely.

The journey of the founding team includes over five years at Carta, where significant strides were made in automating accounting functions. During this time, contributions facilitated the growth of Carta's fund accounting operation from a modest $20 million to an impressive $100 million. Transforming labor-intensive offline Excel processes into seamless, automated workflows not only streamlined operations but also led to a remarkable increase of over 50% in customer satisfaction scores, driven by the establishment of an efficient internal workspace for task coordination.

The traditional method for scaling accounting firms has hinged on hiring additional personnel and increasing outsourcing. Mesh proposes a compelling alternative: a model where accountants can significantly reduce the time spent on individual tasks, avoid the expenses tied to recruiting more staff, and redirect newly freed-up capacity to catalyze substantial business growth.

The backdrop includes a pressing shortage of 340,000 accountants in the United States, compounded by the concerning prediction that 75% of certified public accountants (CPAs) are on the verge of retirement within the next 15 years. Under these circumstances, the integration of AI into this ecosystem emerges as not just advantageous but essential. Mesh aspires to take the lead in automating the sprawling $63 billion domain of outsourced accounting and finance.

"Lucid has the headline ""Fast world models for generative simulations."" Description of Lucid is ""We are building generative simulations of the world powered by fast world models.

Instead of using a physics or game engine with hard-coded rules to render each frame and decide how the environment reacts, this is done end-to-end through a neural network.

Unlike text-to-video models, our world models generate frames conditioned on actions, enabling real-time interaction with any environment. Users can explore, manipulate objects, and shape their experience through natural gameplay.

We trained a model to emulate Minecraft that runs smoothly on consumer hardware (1B param model runs at 25fps on an nvidia 4090 gaming gpu while other Minecraft world models run at <3fps). Our advantage in speed comes from aggressive latent compression (128x) that allows us to encode every frame into only 15 tokens while others traditionally use 256.

We are now training on real-world footage and are building a general-purpose universe simulator.."" Website: https://lucidsim.co/. It is part of the W25 batch, founded on 2024 with a team of 4 based in Berkeley, CA. The Group Partner is Aaron Epstein.","The intriguing premise of Lucid is ""Fast world models for generative simulations."" Lucid operates within the realm of generative simulations, utilizing swift world models as the driving force behind its innovations. This approach diverges from traditional methods that rely on physics or game engines governed by rigid rules to render scenes and dictate environmental responses. Instead, the end-to-end process is facilitated through a neural network, which represents a significant leap in simulation technology.

What sets Lucid apart from existing text-to-video models is the capability of its world models to generate frames based on user actions, thereby fostering real-time interactivity within any given environment. Users benefit from an immersive experience where exploration, object manipulation, and overall engagement occur through seamless gameplay mechanics that feel instinctive.

To exemplify its prowess, Lucid successfully trained a model to replicate the widely popular game Minecraft. This model operates efficiently on standard consumer hardware, achieving a notable performance of 25 frames per second on an NVIDIA 4090 gaming GPU. In contrast, other Minecraft world models struggle to reach even 3 frames per second. The speed advantage that Lucid possesses is attributed to an innovative approach to latent compression, achieving a remarkable 128x reduction that condenses each frame into a mere 15 tokens, while competing models typically utilize 256 tokens.

Currently, Lucid is expanding its capabilities by training on real-world footage, with the ambitious goal of constructing a versatile universe simulator.

Voice AI has always seemed out of reach for hotels because their technology infrastructure is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind.

Hotels spend over $100 billion annually on staffing and lose potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up. By enabling hotels to handle unlimited calls, day or night, Riviera unlocks additional revenue and eases labor challenges.."" Website: https://www.withriviera.com. It is part of the W25 batch, founded on 2024 with a team of 3 based in San Francisco. The Group Partner is Brad Flora.","Riviera presents itself with the striking headline ""AI Voice Agents for Hotels."" The essence of Riviera's mission lies in the development of AI voice agents designed to reduce the time hotels spend answering phone calls, thereby allowing greater focus on enhancing guest experience. The innovative system effectively manages front-desk operator calls, facilitates in-room dining orders, and oversees reservations. Riviera’s technology is capable of providing instantaneous answers to any question, across all languages, around the clock.

The core of this venture addresses a significant challenge faced by many hotels: traditional phone systems and Interactive Voice Recordings (IVR) fail to meet guest expectations for immediate communication, yet hotel management struggles to allocate extra staff to handle the volume of incoming calls. Historically, the prospect of integrating voice AI into hotel operations seemed unattainable, primarily due to the fragmented nature of existing technology infrastructures. These infrastructures often include disjointed reservation systems, loyalty programs, and operational software that lack built-in capabilities for voice AI. Riviera resolves this issue by ensuring seamless integration with the hotel’s current software ecosystem and deploying human-like voice models that are meticulously trained on data unique to each hotel and its respective departments.

The financial implications for hotels are significant, with expenditures exceeding $100 billion annually on staffing alone, and the loss of potential revenue when phone lines become overwhelmed or when callers abandon their attempts to connect. By facilitating the handling of unlimited calls at any hour, Riviera not only unlocks new revenue streams for hotels but also alleviates some of the labor challenges that plague the industry. Detailed information about Riviera can be found at https://www.withriviera.com. This innovative startup is part of the W25 batch, having been established in 2024 by a three-person team based in San Francisco. The venture is guided by the expertise of Group Partner Brad Flora."
