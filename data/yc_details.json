We use cameras and AI to automatically fill federally-required paperwork, reducing the risk of companies being unable to sell their products and increasing factory throughput.\r\n\nUsers have told us the paperwork required for the F-35 fighter jet weighs more than the jet itself! The government requires a record for each of the 1.5 million parts in the jet, including what shop-floor workers do to each part and when they do it.\r\n\nAutomating paperwork by interpreting human actions with cameras is hard. Doing this at the edge and inside secure aerospace environments is harder. We fine-tune the latest vision language models to solve what was previously impossible.\r\n\nManufacturers lose millions when compliance paperwork has errors because it can freeze their ability to sell the product for months. Leaving this task to shop floor workers is both incredibly risky to the company and tedious for the employees. \r\n\nCompliance paperwork is just the beginning. We want to propel American manufacturing into the AI era. America is facing a serious problem: there\u2019s $400B being invested to onshore manufacturing, but there\u2019s simultaneously a projected 15% gap in workers needed due to an aging workforce. We\u2019re on a mission to solve this by building the first AI native software for the shop floor. Our vision is to intelligently connect people, robots, and data to 10x today\u2019s manufacturing capacity.",

Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials \u2013 unlike fission \u2013 we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy.

This allows us to use the same propulsion systems that have been developed by launch vehicles over the last few decades (NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, Relativity Space, ect.).\r\n\nBen and Ross met while working together at Relativity Space, where they qualified the cryogenic flight termination valves for the Terran 1 rocket and continued working together on the heat exchangers and turbomachinery for the AeonR engine.\r\n\nWe are currently working on the first demo of our unique cryo management system and intend to launch an operational vehicle by 2027.",

Before founding Waypoint, Varun worked on AI at Microsoft and Ryan worked on chip design at Apple.\r\n\nUS cities are facing three major crises: congestion, budget deficits, and climate change. At the same time, city governments are understaffed and frequently need to contract work out to expensive consultants. Leveraging recent advancements in AI, we empower cities to reduce their costs, build infrastructure, and respond to problems quickly.\r\n\nIn the United States, state and local governments spend $170B on transportation capital projects, with an estimated 10-15% of that cost going to planning and consultants. This represents an ~$20B market opportunity in the US alone. Through automation, we can redefine the existing transportation and urban planning consulting markets.\r\n\nFor more information, visit waypointtransit.com or contact us at contact@waypointtransit.com.",

Collectors, investors, and hobbyists currently rely on scattered data from auction houses, online forums, and reseller platforms, making it difficult to know the true value of their items. Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\r\n\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint\u2019s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\r\n\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\r\n\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\r\n\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor. By merging Goldman Sachs-level financial analytics with top-tier mathematical talent, Misprint is uniquely positioned to become the go-to platform for fair, transparent pricing in the collectibles space.",

James is joined by Patrick, an applied behavioural scientist who has run over 200 real-world experiments for businesses including Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\nWe joined forces through a shared frustration that no one really understands large scale human behaviours: traditional market research is not only slow and expensive, but fundamentally flawed - it misses how people influence each other. Humans are not isolated individuals, we are social animals.\r\n\nWe began by simulating a network of 1,000 investors, and used it to raise a pre-seed and get into YC. Since releasing this publicly as \u201cWave\u201d, startup founders have run over 3000 simulations. \r\n\nWe have since released \"Reach\", where anyone can simulate their own LinkedIn audience and test how their posts will perform before posting for real. Artificial Societies is doing for simulations what ChatGPT did for LLMs - making them accessible to everyone.\r\n\nAs AI advances, we will create representative models of entire human societies.

Voice AI has always seemed out of reach for hotels because their technology infrastructure is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren\u2019t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing hotel software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each hotel and department.\r\n\nHotels spend over $100 billion annually on staffing and lose potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up. By enabling hotels to handle unlimited calls, day or night, Riviera unlocks additional revenue and eases labor challenges.",

We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\r\n\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\r\n\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\r\n\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\r\n\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\r\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\r\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\r\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\r\n\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year. By solving the member retention challenge, we're positioning ourselves to capture significant value by transforming the member care experience for beneficiaries.",

By flagging potential issues early, you can fix them ahead of production and avoid the frustrating re-spins that drive up costs and delay schedules.\r\n\nWhile traditional EDA tools offer basic ERC and DRC checks\u2014like net connectivity and spacing\u2014they don't dig deeply into component datasheets. Sophris takes it further, analyzing specs and cross-referencing design requirements from multiple sources. As a result, subtle pin misconfigurations, voltage mismatches, and datasheet-specific quirks that typical rule checks might miss are brought to light.\r\n\nBy identifying design flaws during the schematic phase, Sophris helps you iterate confidently and deliver more reliable products. Faster turnarounds, fewer production surprises, and a smoother path from concept to manufacturing. With Sophris, design more confidently and ship more reliably.",
