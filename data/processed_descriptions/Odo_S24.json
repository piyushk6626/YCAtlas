The company\u2019s tool not only identifies relevant contracts but also drafts proposals and provides valuable analytics on past successes and failures based on public records. The results speak volumes\u2014clients have reportedly saved up to 80% of the time previously spent on proposal drafting and have seen an increase in their win rates.\n\nWith a compact team of just two employees, Odo leans heavily on their technology and the backing of a well-known accelerator to drive their growth. They are tagged under several key areas including generative AI, government technology, B2B services, and productivity, highlighting the multifaceted nature of their offering.\n\nFor those interested in government contracts, Odo\u2019s platform is structured to help users discover Requests for Proposals (RFPs) tailored to their business capabilities\u2014be it web development, marketing, or clean energy.
