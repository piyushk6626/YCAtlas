    "generated_description": "**Perceptive Technologies: Revolutionizing Dental Care**\n\nFounded in 2020 in Boston and part of Y Combinator's W20 batch, Perceptive Technologies is on a mission to enhance dental surgery through automation. With a recent Series A funding round under its belt, this venture-backed startup is at the forefront of a significant shift towards automated robotic surgery in dentistry.\n\n### What They Do\n\nAt its core, Perceptive Technologies combines advanced imaging technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics to create a seamless experience for dentists and patients alike. Their novel approach allows for automated tooth cutting, improving accessibility to dental care\u2014especially in underserved populations\u2014within the $452 billion dental industry.\n\n- **Imaging**: They\u2019ve developed a portable intraoral scanner using advanced Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) that captures detailed 3D images of dental structures without X-rays. This technology boasts over 90% accuracy in detecting tooth decay, significantly outperforming traditional 2D X-rays.\n\n- **AI Diagnostics**: Their AI analyzes the rich volumetric data from the imaging process, enabling dentists to diagnose issues earlier and with higher precision. This clarity helps patients understand their dental needs better.\n\n- **Robotic Surgery**: Perceptive is engineering a dental robotic system aimed at completing restorative procedures\u2014like crowns\u2014up to ten times faster than human capabilities. They envision procedures taking as little as 15 minutes and happening in a single visit, eliminating the need for multiple trips to the dentist.\n\n- **Safety First**: The safety of the robotic system is paramount. Their technology is designed to ensure precise treatment even in challenging conditions, with rigorous testing already completed for real-world scenarios.\n\n### Recognition and Impact\n\nPerceptive Technologies has quickly garnered attention, winning the Forsyth DenTech 2021 CareCaptial Award for its innovative contributions. With a dedicated team of 25 and strong backing from industry leaders, they are setting the stage for a transformative period in dental health.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nBy reducing patient discomfort, cutting down surgery times, and ultimately lower costs for dental practices, Perceptive Technologies is not just changing how dental care is delivered; they are reshaping the entire landscape of dental hygiene. They are poised to tell a compelling story of innovation as they continue to grow and impact the market.\n\nFor more information, visit [Perceptive Technologies](https://www.perceptive.io) or reach out via email at info@perceptive.io. Keep an eye on this company\u2014what they\u2019re doing now will likely define future dental care.",
