With no viable market solution and seeing that 1/4 of businesses faced bankruptcy for similar reasons, I founded Respaid, using AI and respect to address the issue. Beyond entrepreneurship, I'm a commander in the French Republican Guard, a pianist, composer, and passionate about fintech meeting psychology. An engineer by training, I graduated from Harvard Business School and Ecole Centrale Electronique. Also, I'm a proud dad of 4 under 5 \ud83d\ude42",
