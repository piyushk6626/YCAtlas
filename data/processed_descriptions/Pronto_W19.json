We solved this by creating a subscription model where drivers pay a monthly recurring subscription of 59 to 99 USD depending on their monthly revenue. This also generates a higher LTV with low CAC as well as high engagement and fidelity ratios.\r\n\nTraction: Since our launch, we have achieved over 2,000,000 processed trips with more than 200,000 users, we bootstrapped until we achieved half a million trips and entered YC.\r\n\nMarket Size: There are over 14,000 second-tier cities in LATAM, with more than 500 million people without any access to ride-sharing or technology platforms at all.",

    "generated_description": "### Company Overview: Pronto\n\n**Mission:** Pronto is revolutionizing ride-sharing and delivery services in second-tier cities across Latin America. Recognizing that cash transactions dominate in these markets, the company has tailored its service to meet local needs in a way that traditional models, like Uber's, can't.\n\n**Business Model:** Unlike typical ride-sharing platforms that charge drivers a percentage of their fares, Pronto operates on a subscription model. Drivers pay a monthly fee ranging from $59 to $99, depending on their revenue. This approach not only alleviates the problem of cash payments but also enhances customer lifetime value (LTV) while keeping customer acquisition costs (CAC) low. The results have been impressive\u2014a loyal driver base and high engagement.\n\n**Traction:** Since its launch, Pronto has facilitated over 2 million trips and amassed more than 200,000 users. After bootstrapping to reach 500,000 trips, Pronto entered Y Combinator in the W19 batch, gaining significant visibility and support.\n\n**Market Opportunity:** There are over 14,000 second-tier cities in Latin America, home to more than 500 million people who currently lack access to reliable ride-sharing and technology platforms. This vast market presents an enormous opportunity for growth.\n\n**Team:** Based in Mexico City, Pronto operates with a team of 62 dedicated employees. Their passion and commitment to improving transportation options in their communities are palpable.\n\n**Future Directions:** Pronto continues to expand both its user base and its service offerings. They aim to create a community-oriented platform where drivers can earn a good income on their own terms\u2014without the burden of commissions.\n\nFor more information or to join the Pronto community, check out their [website](http://www.tuprontomx.com/).",
