Positioning itself at the crossroads of technology and beauty, the company aims to democratize personalized beauty solutions. The mission is clear: there\u2019s no universal answer to beauty, and they empower individuality through tailored products for hair, skin, and body care.\n\nBased in New York City, Function of Beauty is home to a vibrant team of 300 employees and led by Dalton Caldwell as their Group Partner. They focus on cutting-edge, data-backed formulations that prioritize customer uniqueness. Their products are clean, vegan, cruelty-free, and formulated with naturally-derived ingredients to ensure efficacy.\n\nCustomers begin their journey with Function of Beauty by taking a two-minute quiz that assesses hair, body, or skin profiles. This sets the stage for a customized product experience, offering made-to-order solutions that provide specific benefits based on individual needs. Whether addressing damaged hair, skincare concerns, or body care requirements, Function of Beauty strives to ensure that the cosmetics they offer reflect the client\u2019s unique beauty story.\n\nTheir product lineup includes custom haircare, skincare, and bodycare formulas, with special attention on new offerings like the \"Ultimate Hair Repair Trio\" available at major retail partners including Sephora, Target, and Amazon. This integration of e-commerce with personalization has set Function of Beauty apart in the beauty landscape.\n\nIf customized, personalized beauty engagements capture your audience, Function of Beauty opens the door.
