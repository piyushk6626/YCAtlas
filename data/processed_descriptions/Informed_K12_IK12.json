Still today, most school districts have hundreds of mission critical processes that run on paper, making visibility and improvement near impossible.\r\n\nWe transform paperwork from a daily stumbling block to a strategic tool. This makes it possible to hire the right teachers faster, manage bus routes for students without permanent housing, ensure teachers get reimbursed and paid on time, and a lot more. We are powering the future of school district operations by helping district administrators drive the systemic change needed to improve productivity, accountability and equity.",
