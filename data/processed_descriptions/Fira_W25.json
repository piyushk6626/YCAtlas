It reads thousands of integrated unstructured financial reports (often 300 pages) to provide source-cited answers, verifiable financial calculations, and Excel-ready tables \u2014 tasks that typically take hours.\r\n\nWe're initially focusing on boutique investment banks and small private equity firms, covering annual reports of international companies and allowing to upload custom documents. As we develop our product and build clients' trust, we'll eventually integrate directly into clouds.\r\n\nUsing accurate extraction and analysis as single unit of work LLMs do, our vision is to scale it with agents to allow deeper and more thoughtful research, report generation and task execution \u2014 allowing financial teams to focus on ideas and decisions.",
