    "generated_description": "### Piramidal: Foundation Model for the Brain\n\nFounded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch W24, Piramidal is an ambitious startup focused on revolutionizing the understanding and diagnosis of neurological conditions through advanced AI technology. With a mission centered around creating a **Foundation Model for the Brain**, their aim is nothing short of bridging the substantial gap between neuroscience research and real-world EEG applications.\n\n#### The Vision\n\nPiramidal's core offering begins with the ability to provide instant diagnostics for the majority of neurological conditions using their foundational AI. As we near the centenary of Hans Berger's first EEG recording, Piramidal addresses a pivotal challenge: we still don\u2019t fully grasp what brainwaves are telling us. The technology they are developing promises to enhance diagnostic capabilities and contribute meaningfully to patient well-being.\n\n#### The Team\n\nPiramidal is led by a dynamic duo:\n\n- **Dimitris Fotis Sakellariou**, Founder & CEO, boasts a PhD in Neuroengineering and AI and has over a decade of EEG research experience. Before founding Piramidal, he played a key role at IQVIA, shipping deep learning products to the healthcare sector.\n\n- **Kris Pahuja**, co-Founder & CBO, supports this mission with a rich background in product strategy from notable positions at Google and Spotify, including leading initiatives that intersect technology and healthcare.\n\nBoth Dimitris and Kris are supported by an impressive roster of advisors, including leaders in clinical neuroscience and neurology from institutions like King's College London and the Cleveland Clinic.\n\n#### The Journey Ahead\n\nWith just two full-time employees at the helm, Piramidal is leaning into innovation, aiming to catalyze significant breakthroughs in the neurological field. To learn more about their work, check out their website: [Piramidal.ai](https://piramidal.ai).\n\nAs they navigate this complex landscape of brain science and AI, Piramidal has the potential to turn scientific research into practical applications that can change lives. In an age where understanding our own biology is crucial, they\u2019re setting out to decode our brainwaves and improve health outcomes, one AI model at a time.",
