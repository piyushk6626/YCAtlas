We partner with creators to release limited-edition filters for their fans to use on social media. It turns out: the face filters you see everywhere on Snapchat and Instagram are created by independent artists - not by the platforms. These artists ALMOST NEVER get money for their work - which is insane! Filta fixes this by giving these creators a marketplace and the best filter creation tool anywhere. Interested in working on the future of digital fashion, AR/VR, and web3? Hit us up. We're hiring.",
