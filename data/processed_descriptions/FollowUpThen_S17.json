    "description": "FollowUpThen is a personal assistant that sends you exactly what you need at exactly the right moment to get something done. Its uncanny timing is not the result of AI wizardry, but rather an explicit reminder syntax that is embedded in an email address. Email 1min@followupthen.com, 1hour@followupthen.com or {any-time}@followupthen.com and you'll get the email back at that time. Adding a reminder to any email is a one-second operation thanks to your email client's address autocomplete.\r\n\nExample use-cases include:\r\n * Following up with sales prospects\r\n * Maintaining relationships\r\n * Task delegation (put FollowUpThen in the bcc field)\r\n * Just-in-time reminders to get a task done (pay bills, etc)\r\n * Hitting inbox zero (forwarding emails to your future)\r\n\nIn today's workplace we are bombarded with realtime demands on our attention. FollowUpThen answers this trend by making work more asynchronous, allowing you to place information in the future,  giving you freedom and peace of mind in the present and allowing you actually get something done.",
