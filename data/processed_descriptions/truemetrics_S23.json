In partnership with Y Combinator\u2019s S23 batch, they\u2019re tackling a crucial issue in delivery logistics: the often-broken navigation systems that cause delays and frustrations for couriers.\n\n**The Problem: Broken Navigation**\n\nThe statement \"You Have Arrived At Your Destination!\" doesn\u2019t ring true for many couriers. They often find themselves stuck searching for parking space or figuring out complex building entrances. A staggering 15% of all navigation pins can be over 70 meters away from the actual entrance, wasting valuable delivery seconds\u2014time that could mean the difference between a satisfied customer and a frustrated one.\n\n**The Solution: Entrance and Parking Location Data**\n\nTruemetrics provides a smart solution by harnessing sophisticated sensor data from drivers' smartphones. This allows them to generate precise coordinates for parking spots and building entrances. By integrating this data into their systems, couriers can save anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes on each delivery. Imagine that multiplied across hundreds of deliveries\u2014it's a potential game changer for logistics companies.\n\nTheir technology isn't just about saving time. It\u2019s about enhancing efficiency and improving the overall delivery experience for both couriers and customers. With Truemetrics, drivers can find optimal parking positions rapidly, enabling them to save an average of 32.7 seconds at each stop. This immediately translates into better performance metrics for logistics firms.\n\n**Engagement and Integration**\n\nTruemetrics positions itself as an indispensable partner for delivery startups and established logistics giants alike, working with notable names in the industry, like GLS and Toyota. Their system integrates seamlessly\u2014with just a few lines of code\u2014allowing logistics companies to adopt this technology with minimal downtime.\n\nAs part of a next-gen tech reshaping logistics, Truemetrics leverages AI and machine learning to curate delivery data that tracks real-world interactions. This innovative approach lets companies say goodbye to outdated methods like geofencing, and instead hello to real-time interaction tracking.\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n\nLocated in a city that embodies innovation, Truemetrics is pioneering solutions that address fundamental flaws in delivery systems. Their focused mission is clear: make deliveries faster, more efficient, and successful by providing essential data that simplifies the couriers' journey from the parking lot to the customer\u2019s door.\n\nYou can check out their progress and explore their offerings at [truemetrics.io](https://www.truemetrics.io/). Whether you're a logistics company looking for a boost or a tech enthusiast keen on the delivery revolution, Truemetrics is one to watch.",
