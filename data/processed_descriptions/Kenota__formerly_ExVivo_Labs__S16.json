    "generated_description": "**Kenota (formerly ExVivo Labs): Revolutionizing Allergy Testing**\n\nKenota is on a mission to transform how we diagnose and test for allergies, making the process easier, faster, and more accurate for both patients and allergists. Founded in 2014 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S16, the company is based in Kitchener, Canada, and has grown to a dedicated team of 35.\n\n**Website:** [kenota.com](https://kenota.com/)\n\n### What They Do\n\nKenota has developed an innovative point-of-care allergy testing solution that delivers lab-quality results right in the allergist's office. This means patients can get tested and receive accurate results during a single visit, eliminating the traditional need for lab referrals and long waiting periods. Their flagship system, the Kenota 1, has received significant regulatory approval, including FDA 510(k) clearance and a CLIA waiver for in-office testing of Total IgE.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Speed:** Test results in just 30 minutes.\n- **Less Invasive:** Utilizes a simple fingerstick method to collect blood samples.\n- **Convenience:** Allows for immediate reporting and diagnosis, all within one visit.\n\n### The Importance of Allergy Testing\n\nWith 32 million people in the U.S. suffering from food allergies, many of which can be life-threatening, Kenota's advancements in allergy testing are crucial. Their point-of-care approach allows allergists to quickly assess patients' sensitizations to allergens, significantly improving patient care.\n\n### Milestones & Achievements\n\n- **2018:** Concept development for the allergy testing system.\n- **2019:** Established a scalable manufacturing facility in Waterloo Region.\n- **2020:** Raised $11 million in Series A funding.\n- **2023:** Completed clinical studies; received FDA clearance.\n- **2024:** First CLIA Waiver approval for in-office Total IgE testing.\n\n### The Team\n\nKenota boasts a team rich in scientific, clinical, and commercial expertise. Their approach is deeply rooted in collaboration with healthcare professionals to tailor their solutions to real-world needs in allergy diagnosis.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nKenota is not just stopping at allergy diagnostics; their technology could easily adapt to other medical conditions, extending its impact on healthcare further. By focusing on a decentralized model of testing, they are reshaping how allergy care is delivered today.\n\nTo keep up with their latest developments, or if you're interested in joining their mission, visit their careers page on their website.\n\nFor more details, explore their [technologies and innovations](https://kenota.com/our-technology/) or check their [news updates](https://kenota.com/#news-items) for insights on their ongoing projects and future endeavors.",
