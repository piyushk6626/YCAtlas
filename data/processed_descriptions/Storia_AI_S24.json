    "description": "With AI increasingly automating away code generation, software engineers will spend more time reading, judging, and architecting code rather than writing it. Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project\u2019s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\nSage\u2019s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren\u2019t going to cut it. \r\n\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called \u201cRAG\u201d (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.",

    "generated_description": "**Storia AI: Revolutionizing Code Understanding with an Open-Source AI Copilot**\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, Storia AI is carving out a unique niche. Founded in 2023 and currently part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Storia AI is on a mission to transform how developers interact with code. Their vision is straightforward yet ambitious: to build an open-source AI copilot that comprehensively understands a company's code and its broader context. \n\nAs the industry moves towards automating code generation, software engineers increasingly find themselves in roles that require deep comprehension of existing code rather than just writing new lines. Storia AI tackles this shift head-on with a tool named Sage. Think of Sage as a smart assistant for developers\u2014an AI that not only generates suggestions but truly understands the nuances of a specific codebase.\n\n### What Can Sage Do?\n\nSage acts as a powerful resource for developers, capable of answering complex questions that go beyond simple coding tasks. Here\u2019s what it offers:\n\n1. **Contextual Recommendations**: Developers can consult Sage on technical choices, like determining the right vector database that meets project constraints.\n2. **Comparative Analysis**: It can clarify why one database option might be more suitable than another\u2014say, Redis versus Milvus.\n3. **Integration Queries**: Sage assesses codebases for compatibility with other libraries and provides actionable steps for integration.\n\nWhat sets Sage apart is its reliance on verified sources. Instead of generating potentially misleading information (a common issue known as \"hallucination\"), Sage provides answers anchored in a wealth of documentation from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and internal technical documents. This places reliable, contextualized knowledge directly in the hands of developers.\n\n### A Strong Foundation\n\nStoria AI was founded by a small but formidable team with deep roots in both AI and software engineering. Julia has extensive experience with contextual neural networks, having worked on foundational technologies at Google, while Mihail was instrumental in developing early LLMs (Large Language Models) at Amazon Alexa. Their 20+ years of combined experience positions them uniquely to tackle the challenges of building an AI that comprehends complex codebases.\n\n### Where They\u2019re Headed\n\nCurrently located in Millbrae, CA, Storia AI operates with a compact team of two talented individuals, backed by David Lieb as their Group Partner. The tagging of their work in areas like \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019, \u2018developer tools\u2019, and \u2018machine learning\u2019 indicates a focused strategy that resonates deeply within the tech community. As they progress, there are ambitious goals to deepen Sage\u2019s understanding of not just private codebases but potentially every line of code available online.\n\nIn a nutshell, Storia AI is not just another tech startup; it's a thoughtful response to the inevitable evolution of software development. By building a bridge between AI and developers, they\u2019re paving the way for more efficient, informed, and high-quality code architecture. If you\u2019re interested in learning more or seeking support for your own codebase, check out their website at [storia.ai](https://storia.ai). \n\nStoria AI is a company to watch, not just for what they are building today but for how they will shape the future of coding.",
