    "description": "Mindely is the first AI interviewer designed for skills assessment interviews. \r\n\nHiring for high volume, high turnover roles (e.g., consultants, analysts, sales & customer representatives) is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to unconscious bias. Managers spend valuable time on lengthy skill-based interviews instead of focusing on building candidate relationships or on driving company revenue. \r\n\nTraditional AI interviewers don\u2019t solve these issues \u2013 their rigid Q&A formats and one-size-fits-all approach can\u2019t handle complex skill assessments. Mindely changes the game as the first AI interviewer built for in-depth case study, technical and role-play interviews. It: \r\n- Simulates human interaction with real-time dialogue \r\n- Challenges candidates with dynamic, adaptive responses \r\n- Eliminates interviewer bias to create a fair, inclusive hiring process \r\n- Works 24/7 to free up senior staff and widen talent pool \r\n\nWith Mindely, companies can rapidly customize and deploy human interviews at AI scale to test specific on-the-job skills.",
