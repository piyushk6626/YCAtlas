This is our second time co-founding a design tools company \u2013 our first company was acquired by Airbnb in 2017 and we became the design tools team there.\r\n\nAt Airbnb, we built the design infrastructure that the entire company relied on to scale design without increasing headcount costs. We did this by letting non-designers (such as marketing, PMs, and engineering) design screens and websites.  Now we're making these tools available to every company.",

    "generated_description": "Noya Software is on a mission to democratize design with their innovative product design tools aimed at making design accessible for everyone\u2014not just designers. Founded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator's W23 batch, Noya comes from a team that has experience in shaping design tools, having previously co-founded a company that was acquired by Airbnb in 2017. \n\nAt Airbnb, the team developed robust design infrastructure that enabled non-designers\u2014including marketing professionals, product managers, and engineers\u2014to create screens and websites without inflating headcount costs. Now, they're bringing these powerful capabilities to companies everywhere through Noya's open platform.\n\nThe company is currently a lean operation with just two employees but aims to empower other non-designers to start crafting their own websites, landing pages, wireframes, and artwork through an intuitive suite of collaborative, AI-powered design tools. \n\nNoya's product offerings include **Design Tokens**, **Vector Artwork**, and a **Whiteboard** for collaborative brainstorming, with the potential for users to build their own tools leveraging Noya\u2019s APIs. Their tools stand out for supporting real-time collaboration and an integrated AI assistant that helps automate repetitive tasks.\n\nNoya is also mindful of pricing. They offer a **free Starter** plan allowing users to create up to five files, a **Professional** plan for $12/month with unlimited files and features, and a custom **Enterprise** plan for larger teams or complex needs. \n\nSo, if you're a non-designer looking to bring your ideas to life, Noya Software is making it easier than ever to design like a pro.
