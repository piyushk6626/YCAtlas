Clients, such as a global chemical manufacturer in Sub-Saharan Africa, have reported significant reductions in time needed for permit preparation, enhancing both safety and compliance throughout their operations.\n\n**Why Choose Raven?**  \nWith a team made up of former managers, engineers, and AI specialists, Raven leverages over 30 years of industrial experience from reputable companies like Reliance and ONGC Petro Additives. This unique blend of expertise positions Raven to deliver AI solutions that genuinely meet the needs of modern manufacturing.\n\nIn short, Raven isn\u2019t just selling a product; it's offering a transformation in how manufacturing plants operate.
