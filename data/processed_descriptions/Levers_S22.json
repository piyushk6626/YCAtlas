As one of the first hires, I wore many hats beyond investment and portfolio work including strategy, compliance, financial reporting, marketing, and HRM. I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Philosophy from Yale. \n\nI am a tinkerer at heart and love to seek out new experiences. I feel most at home by the sea, so you'll often find me looking for new diving spots, fishing, or trying to catch some waves",
