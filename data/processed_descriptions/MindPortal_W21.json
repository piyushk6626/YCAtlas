    "description": "MindPortal is a pioneering AI research company advancing human-AI interaction by enabling people to communicate with computers and AI assistants purely through thought. As an AI company, we focus exclusively on model development rather than hardware. Our models are designed to be general-purpose, adaptable across a wide range of applications. Our flagship development, MindSpeech, is the first supervised AI model to translate imagined speech into text, enabling direct thought-to-language communication. MindSpeech has earned endorsements from leading experts, including Neuralink's former technical strategy head and DARPA\u2019s N3 program lead scientist. Our thought-to-language AI models have the potential for transformative applications in fields such as healthcare, education, and VR/AR and our work has been featured in major publications such as Forbes, The Times, The Telegraph, and Business Insider. MindPortal has over 11 patents filed in the field and is backed by prominent investors such as Y Combinator.",
