The unique setup of Novig claims to increase users' chances of winning by a factor of ten compared to conventional sportsbooks.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **No-Vig Model**: Users enjoy more favorable odds without the usual \u201cvig\u201d or commission that typically eats into profits.\n- **Community Betting**: Bet against friends or an open market instead of the house, making for a more engaging and interactive experience.\n- **Dual Play Options**: Novig allows users to bet with fun, non-redeemable coins or real cash, with bonuses and rewards for engaged players.\n\n### The Team and Backing\n\nWith a compact team of 12, Novig benefits from guidance under **Dalton Caldwell**, a partner at **Y Combinator**, where Novig participated in the Summer 2022 batch. This pedigree speaks volumes about its potential in a competitive space.\n\n### Statistics and Growth\n\nAs of now, Novig is available in **42 states** across the U.S., making it accessible to a large audience eager for a new betting experience. Its users are reported to be **43% profitable**, a stark contrast to the 3% profitability often cited among competitors.
