    "generated_description": "**New Incentives: Saving Lives Through Cash Transfers**\n\n**Mission:** New Incentives is on a mission that speaks volumes: \"Cash transfers that save lives.\" This nonprofit organization is focused on improving childhood vaccination rates by encouraging Nigerian mothers to immunize their infants against preventable diseases.\n\n**Founded and Location:** Established as part of Y Combinator\u2019s S16 batch, New Incentives is headquartered in San Francisco. With a dedicated team of 51 employees, they are leveraging technology and data to amplify their impact.\n\n**What They Do:** Their approach is straightforward but highly effective: New Incentives provides cash incentives to families after their children receive vaccinations at government clinics. This isn\u2019t just about handing out cash; it\u2019s about creating a reliable system that ensures children get the care they need. They also help raise awareness about vaccination benefits and work to improve local vaccine supply chains.\n\n**Measured Impact:** The results are compelling:\n- Over 4.5 million infants have been served by their program.\n- Nearly 19 million cash transfers have been issued after vaccination verification.\n- A stunning 86% retention rate ensures that families remain engaged throughout the vaccination cycle.\n\nIn independent trials, New Incentives demonstrated significant increases in vaccination coverage:\n- A 108% increase in full vaccination rates.\n- A 62% increase in timely measles vaccinations.\n- A 180% improvement in clinics avoiding stockouts of vaccines.\n\nWith data updated daily, it\u2019s clear that New Incentives is making strides where it matters most, addressing child mortality rates in Nigeria\u2014where approximately 40% of deaths among children under five are due to vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\n**Why It Matters:** Every 19 seconds, a child dies from a vaccine-preventable disease. New Incentives tackles this grim reality head-on, proving that financial incentives can align public health goals with urgent humanitarian needs.\n\n**Funding and Recognition:** This organization has garnered recognition from esteemed charity evaluators and funders, attaining vital support that allows them to operate effectively while striving to be one of the most cost-effective charities in the world.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more or wish to support their mission, visit [New Incentives' website](http://www.newincentives.org) for more information.",
