The founders, Raghav Malik and Rajat Jaiswal, bring a potent mix of expertise to the table: Raghav, a seasoned algorithmic trader from Columbia University, and Rajat, a tech wizard from IIT Delhi who started building out the company's infrastructure while still in college.\n\nAlgoTest aims to level the playing field, allowing day traders access to the same cutting-edge trading technology that top hedge funds and high-frequency trading firms enjoy. Backed by Y Combinator (Batch S22), they\u2019re not just breaking into the market; they are defining how options trading is done.\n\n### What They Do\n\nThe platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools tailored for options trading:\n\n- **Backtesting**: Quickly test strategies against years of data with detailed reports, making it easier to find what works without risking capital.\n- **Algo Trading**: Deploy strategies effortlessly with a single click across over 30 brokers.\n- **Forward Testing**: Virtually trade strategies to hone them before going live.\n- **Discretionary Tools**: Build and analyze strategies directly from option chains or simulate them with historical data.\n- **Custom Automation**: Whether it\u2019s TradingView signals or Python scripts, AlgoTest helps traders automate their processes.\n\n### The Features that Stand Out\n\nWith features like a strategy builder, margin calculator, and advanced charting tools, AlgoTest caters to both new and experienced traders.
