    "description": "A web app that offers live online courses in programming, design, data, online marketing and more.\r\n\nOur courses are nearly as affordable as online Moocs (~$40 a month) and as effective as Bootcamps. We achieve this by running 100 person live classes with one expert professor and one mentor per 15 students. Every class, students need to turn in assignments that are corrected by their mentors and at the end of the course they need to turn in and approve a final project. We also help our selected students with careers services such as mockup interviews, Linkedin enhancement, and more. All of this creates a level of accountability that allows us to achieve really low churn levels (<9%).\r\n\nOur career tracks last between 9-11 months and we give our selected students their money back in case they don't get a job 6 months after they are done with the course.",

    "generated_description": "**Coderhouse: Learning Made Live and Easy**\n\nFounded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator's Batch W21, Coderhouse is based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and has quickly established itself as a prominent player in the online education space. With a team of 225 employees, its mission is to offer effective and accessible online live education that competes with both cost and quality against traditional Bootcamps and MOOCs.\n\n### How It Works\n\nAt Coderhouse, students can enroll in live, interactive courses across various fields: programming, design, data science, digital marketing, and more, all at a competitive price point of approximately $40 per month. The courses typically span 9 to 11 months and feature a unique structure where classes are capped at 100 students, with a dedicated expert professor and a mentor for every 15 students. \n\nStudents engage in assignments that are reviewed by their mentors, culminating in a final project that must be approved. To further enhance accountability and support, Coderhouse offers career services, including mock interviews and LinkedIn profile enhancements. This structured approach has led to exceptionally low churn rates of less than 9%.\n\n### Refund Policy\n\nOne distinctive aspect of Coderhouse\u2019s offering is its guarantee: if a graduate does not secure a job within six months of completing a course, they can claim a full refund. This not only reflects Coderhouse\u2019s confidence in its educational model but also helps build trust with potential students.\n\n### Courses and Specializations\n\nWith a wide range of courses and career tracks available, students can select programs that suit their interests and aspirations. Options range from full-stack web development to data analytics, UX/UI design, digital marketing, and beyond. The platform is designed to be flexible, allowing learners to engage with course materials at their own pace while also benefiting from scheduled live interactions.\n\n### Community and Success\n\nSince its inception, Coderhouse has produced over 350,000 graduates who are now employed in leading companies, thanks in part to the network of partnerships that Coderhouse has cultivated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCoderhouse presents a compelling alternative for individuals seeking to enhance their skills in a rapidly changing job market. Its focus on live interaction, accountability, and job placement support sets it apart in a crowded field. \n\nFor more information, visit [Coderhouse](https://www.coderhouse.com/).",
