    "generated_description": "**Bloom Institute of Technology: A New Kind of Coding School**\n\nFounded in 2017 and born from the progressive incubator Y Combinator, the Bloom Institute of Technology, or BloomTech, is a unique online coding school based in San Francisco. It's built on a straightforward mission: to invest in you, the student.\n\n### The Model: Pay When You Succeed\n\nWhat sets BloomTech apart is its pay-when-you-get-a-job model. Students can access a full computer science education without paying upfront. Instead, the tuition is deferred until graduates secure a high-paying job\u2014specifically one above a certain salary threshold. If things don't pan out, and they don\u2019t land a job or earn above that threshold, they owe nothing. It\u2019s a bold move rooted in assurance and accountability, aiming to democratize tech education.\n\n### Courses and Support\n\nBloomTech offers flexible programs, including:\n\n- **Full Stack Web Development**\n- **AI for Developer Productivity**\n\nThese options allow students to learn at their own pace through a mix of live and recorded classes, completing their studies in as little as four months to eighteen months. Plus, with a staggering **86% job placement rate** for 2022 graduates and a **median salary increase** of over $37,000 for those placed, BloomTech is doing something right.\n\nThe support doesn\u2019t just stop at teaching. From the moment you enroll, BloomTech provides career coaching, job application assistance, and interview preparation\u2014because successfully landing a job is just as important as acquiring tech skills.\n\n### The Team and Vision\n\nWith a dedicated team of about 50 employees, BloomTech is focused on creating pathways into technology careers for individuals from all backgrounds. The company is continuously evolving its strategies to leverage AI in enhancing developer skills and productivity, exemplifying how tech and education can intersect powerfully.\n\n### Join the Movement\n\nWith over 4,000 graduates since its inception, BloomTech is not just providing education; they\u2019re crafting careers. If you\u2019re curious to dip your toes into the world of tech without the financial risk, BloomTech offers risk-free trials to give prospective students a sneak peek into their programs.\n\nFor more information about their courses, alumni stories, and to see if you\u2019re ready to launch your tech career, visit [Bloom Institute of Technology](https://www.bloomtech.com).\n\nIn an age where tech jobs are plentiful and often require specialized training that can be cost-prohibitive, BloomTech is paving the way for a more inclusive future\u2014one where income-driven education is the norm rather than the exception.",
