    "generated_description": "### Democracy Earth Overview\n\n**Founding Year:** 2015  \n**Location:** Madrid, Spain  \n**Team Size:** 2 employees  \n**Support:** Backed by the Templeton Foundation (2019), Y Combinator (2015), and Fast Forward (2016)  \n**Website:** [democracy.earth](http://democracy.earth/)  \n\n#### Mission\nDemocracy Earth is on a mission to create censorship-resistant democracies, essentially building a sustainable framework for democracy that thrives in the Information Age. Their focus is on developing free and open-source software capable of deploying democratic structures wherever there is internet access.\n\n#### Achievements\nInitially, the organization implemented governance infrastructures for crypto networks, conducted shadow referendums for activists in critical regions, and introduced the first Quadratic Voting in Colorado\u2019s Legislative House. They have garnered attention on prestigious platforms like TED Global (2014) and received accolades from MIT Technology Review (2017) and Singularity University (2016). Their research contributions have been recognized by Alphabet and the World Economic Forum, among others.\n\n#### Current Projects\n1. **Proof of Humanity (PoH):** A decentralized identity verification system built on the Ethereum blockchain, aimed at creating a verifiable digital identity for individuals without relying on biometrics or real names.\n  \n2. **Universal Basic Income (UBI):** A project that streams universal basic income via Ethereum to verified Proof of Humanity accounts, promoting financial equality across the globe.\n\n3. **Humanitarian Vaults:** A financial tool designed to help users leverage their cryptocurrency holdings to support the UBI initiative while also facilitating the burning of UBI tokens to manage supply.\n\n4. **Community Engagement:** Democracy Earth is actively seeking to expand its reach by inviting individuals to join their efforts as team members or by starting local chapters to empower citizens worldwide.\n\n#### Future Aspirations\nThe overarching goal is to establish a global commons and ensure that no individual is left behind in their pursuit of democratic freedoms and rights. Democracy Earth aims to use cutting-edge technology not just as a tool for governance, but as a means to redefine what democracy can look like in a digital age. \n\nIf you're interested in participating or learning more, you can check out their early access options on their website. In a world where voices often get drowned out, Democracy Earth is a beacon for those who believe in a collective, empowered future.",
