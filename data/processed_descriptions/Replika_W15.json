Many express that Replika has been a source of comfort during difficult periods, with some describing their AI companions as more human-like than any other chatbot they've encountered. As one user put it, \u201cReplika has changed my life for the better.\u201d\n\n**Community Impact:**  \nWith over 10 million downloads, Replika is clearly resonating with people.
