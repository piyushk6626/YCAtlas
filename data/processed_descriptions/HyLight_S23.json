    "description": "HyLight builds and operates autonomous airships for long range monitoring. We focus on detecting methane leaks on pipelines and defects on power lines.\r\n\nOur innovation, the HyLighter, is a crossover between drone and airship technology. Like a drone, it is easily controllable and transportable. And, like an airship, it is extremely energy-efficient, enabling it to fly for up to 10 hours at slow speed (22mph) for optimal data collection which represents a range of 220miles. \r\n\nToday, energy infrastructure operators struggle with conducting inspections that are simultaneously: massive and precise. HyLight offers a solution to precisely detect issues on the infrastructure at an industrial scale, and all of this without emitting GHGs.\r\n\nWe are 3 co-founders experienced in hardware and energy companies with Masters in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Business from the best Engineering and Business School in France.\r\n\nWe have developed 5 different flying aircrafts and signed 5 pilots programs with major energy infrastructure operators. We also have LOIs worth over $3.5M.",

Their primary focus is on long-range monitoring, specifically detecting methane leaks in pipelines and identifying defects in power lines.\n\n**The Product - HyLighter:**  \nImagine a hybrid between a drone and an airship. That\u2019s the HyLighter. This ingenious piece of technology is not just easy to control and transport like a drone; it\u2019s also exceptionally energy-efficient, allowing it to stay airborne for up to 10 hours at a cruising speed of 22 mph. In practical terms, that translates to a 220-mile range for comprehensive data collection without the carbon footprint\u2014a big deal in today\u2019s climate-conscious world.\n\n**Addressing the Challenge:**  \nEnergy infrastructure operators face a dual challenge of inspecting vast networks while ensuring precision. Traditional methods often fall short, leaving critical issues undetected. HyLight steps in here, providing industrial-scale precision in monitoring, all without emitting greenhouse gases (GHGs).\n\n**Founders:** The team consists of three co-founders who bring strong backgrounds in hardware and energy sectors, holding master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Business from France's leading institutions.\n\n**Achievements So Far:**  \n- Development of five unique flying aircraft models.  \n- Secured pilot programs with five major energy infrastructure operators.  \n- Letters of Intent (LOIs) worth over $3.5 million.  \n\n**Core Values and Tags:**  \nHyLight is grouped under industry tags that highlight its commitment to hydrogen energy, business-to-business (B2B) solutions, climate initiatives, energy efficiency, and aerospace innovations.\n\n**Online Presence:**  \nYou can learn more about their innovative solutions and vision by visiting their website at [HyLight](https://www.hylight.aero/).\n\nIn summary, HyLight isn\u2019t just another tech startup; it\u2019s a thoughtfully crafted solution to a pressing problem in the energy sector. Their unique approach, paired with a dedicated team, makes them a company worth watching as they stride into a more sustainable future.",
