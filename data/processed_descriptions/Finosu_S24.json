    "description": "Hi - Mark and Gab here!\r\n\nWe met while working at Alt, a marketplace for collectibles, where we built a $200 million specialty finance business line. At Alt, we faced the complex challenges that come with servicing consumer loans. We spent countless hours and resources developing internal tools to manage loan payments, communicate with borrowers, and keep track of loan performance\u2014all while ensuring a positive experience for our customers.\r\n\nHowever, after dealing with the headaches of manual data entry, fragmented systems, delayed payments, lack of personalized borrower engagement, and the stress of maintaining accurate records, we knew there had to be a better way to service consumer loans.\r\n\nSo, we started Finosu to build the servicer we wish we had\u2014an AI-powered consumer loan servicer designed to streamline and enhance every aspect of the loan servicing process. Our mission is to transform loan servicing into a seamless, efficient, and customer-centric experience.\r\nSo, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had.\r\n\nFinsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with:  outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure.\r\n\nThe operational cost of originating and servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business \u2013 we are changing that.",
