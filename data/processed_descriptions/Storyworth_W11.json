Their concept is elegantly simple: each week, they send subscribers a thought-provoking question about their life, like \u201cWhat do you remember of your grandmother?\u201d Customers respond via email, and these responses are saved and shared privately with family. At the end of the year, all these precious stories are compiled into a professionally bound book.\n\n**Product and Services:** \n- **Weekly Questions:** Users receive a weekly email prompting a story.\n- **Beautiful Keepsake Books:** At the end of the year, stories are published in a high-quality book that families can treasure forever.\n- **Voice Recording Option:** Newer features even allow users to record audio responses, which are transcribed for inclusion in the final book.\n- **Celebrations:** This feature lets users compile stories and photos from a group into a single keepsake book, perfect for celebrations like birthdays or anniversaries.\n\n**Why Storyworth?**\n- **Independent and Family-Owned:** Unlike many services, Storyworth is owned by the founders, ensuring a strong commitment to their customers over investors.\n- **A Trusted Brand:** With a decade of experience and a history of profitability, families can trust them to safeguard and cherish their stories long-term.\n- **Privacy Guaranteed:** Stories are private by default and can be downloaded at any time, providing peace of mind to users.\n\n**Recognition:** Featured by various media outlets like CNN, Fox News, and New York Magazine, Storyworth has cemented its reputation. In 2022, it was included in The New York Times Wirecutter\u2019s list of the \"30 Best Gifts for Families.\"\n\n**Current Promotions:** They\u2019re currently running a Valentine\u2019s Day sale offering $10 off, encouraging families to start their storytelling journey together.\n\n**Conclusion:** Storyworth is more than just a service; it\u2019s a tangible way to connect with family and preserve legacies, making it an invaluable resource for those who understand that everyone's story is worth sharing. Whether you're looking to learn more about your loved ones or to keep memories alive, Storyworth caters to both needs beautifully.\n\nFor more information or to begin your storytelling journey, visit [Storyworth](https://www.storyworth.com).",
