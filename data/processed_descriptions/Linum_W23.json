At Linum, we\u2019re using AI to build the tools that will enable this transition.\r\n\nLinum was founded by Sahil Chopra and Manu Chopra - two brothers with 10 years of AI experience. Sahil co-wrote Stanford\u2019s graduate-course on LLMs (Large Language Models). Manu trained RL (Reinforcement Learning) models for anesthesia administration at UCSF. \r\n\nSign up for our beta at https://www.linum.ai/",

    "generated_description": "Linum is a pioneering company that sits at the intersection of text and video, aiming to radically transform how we think about content creation. Founded in 2022 by brothers Sahil and Manu Chopra, Linum is harnessing the power of AI to build state-of-the-art text-to-video diffusion models. Their mission? To allow anyone to \"type text\" and \"dream video,\" democratizing the creation of animated content much like YouTube did for video sharing over the past decade.\n\nSahil, with his strong background in AI, even co-authored a graduate course at Stanford on Large Language Models. Meanwhile, Manu has specialized in Reinforcement Learning applications in healthcare, making them a well-rounded duo with a decade of combined experience. \n\nLinum's headquarters are in San Francisco, where a small but dedicated team of three is hard at work. They are currently part of the Y Combinator Batch W23, where they are honing their product and looking to scale.\n\nThe company anticipates a future where everyday people will generate the majority of animation, TV, and film\u2014a vision they\u2019re actively putting into practice. If you\u2019re interested in what they\u2019re creating, you can sign up for their beta on their website at [linum.ai](https://www.linum.ai/).\n\nIn summary, Linum isn\u2019t just about tech; they\u2019re about enabling creativity and expression for the masses. If you\u2019re intrigued by the potential of text-to-video technology, don\u2019t miss the chance to get in on this ground floor opportunity.",
