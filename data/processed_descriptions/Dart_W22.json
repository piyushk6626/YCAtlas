As the first engineer there I laid the groundwork for our full stack application suite, data pipelines, and ML and CV models. We grew very quickly so I hired out a full team, building and managing an org of dozens of engineers, product managers, and others.\n\nWould love to chat about Dart (which typically saves teams about a third of their PM time) or anything else--ping me!",
