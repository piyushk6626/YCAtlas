We were skeptical about that and decided to talk to users of platforms such as UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blueprism, all of them low-code.\r\n\nTalking to users, we discovered that unique automations incorporating exclusive company processes and intelligence that have the potential to transform the business must be implemented by tech teams. It's not about mimicking employees performing isolated tasks. It's about designing a new workflow, integrated with the company's technological stack and systems. There are just 100.000 RPA skilled users compared to 22M developers globally that can become RPA coders on Day 1 with BotCity.\r\n\nWe believe that all automation efforts in a single platform is more efficient. We started delivering the best RPA experience for tech teams, but we envision creating the perfect place to also manage crawlers, integrations, scrappers, data operations. Every company automation in a single place.\r\n\nAs companies are becoming tech first and automation will be a basic KPI, we are building to be the all-in-one automation ops management.",

    "generated_description": "### BotCity: Revolutionizing Automation with Python\n\n**Overview**  \nBotCity, founded in 2020 and now part of Y Combinator's W22 batch, is transforming the landscape of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for tech teams. Nestled in San Francisco with a compact team of 18, BotCity aims to provide an open-source, Python-based platform that streamlines automation across various business processes.\n\n**Mission**  \nAt its core, BotCity believes in democratizing automation. While many low-code platforms claim that any business user can build automations, BotCity took a more pragmatic approach. Conversations with users of major players like UiPath and Automation Anywhere revealed that truly unique automations require technical expertise. BotCity's vision is to empower developers \u2014 not just mimic manual labor \u2014 by enabling them to create sophisticated workflows seamlessly integrated within their company's tech stack.\n\n**Key Features**  \n1. **Centralized Automation**: All automation activities\u2014be it data operations, scrapers, or integrations\u2014can be managed from a single platform.\n2. **No Vendor Lock-In**: Unlike traditional low-code platforms, the code built using BotCity is fully owned by the user, providing flexibility and freedom from vendor constraints.\n3. **Comprehensive Tools**: Through products like BotCity Orchestrator, Devtools, and Insights, the company is focused on enhancing the entire automation lifecycle from design to deployment.\n\n**The Market Position**  \nWith an estimated 100,000 skilled RPA users compared to 22 million developers ready to dive into coding, BotCity is uniquely positioned. Their platform allows these developers to start automating effectively from day one, enhancing productivity and driving significant savings. In a world where businesses are increasingly tech-focused, automation is becoming a critical KPI, and BotCity's goal is to lead this change.\n\n**Results & Impact**  \nThe effectiveness of BotCity's platform is evident. Clients have reported drastic reductions in manual labor and operational costs\u2014like LG Electronics Brazil saving over 15,000 hours of work, and Grupo Saga automating 3,700 hours while also achieving significant cost reductions. These success stories highlight the practical benefits of transitioning from low-code to BotCity's Python-based automation.\n\n**Call to Action**  \nIf you're intrigued by the potential of intelligent automation and want to boost your team\u2019s productivity while minimizing costs, BotCity invites you to explore their platform. It\u2019s an all-in-one solution where the power of Python meets the future of automation without the usual constraints.
