The company specializes in speech and accent coaching for non-native English speakers. Its mission is straightforward: to help individuals speak clearly and confidently in English.\n\n**What They Do**\n\nThe platform merges bite-sized video lessons from Hollywood accent coaches with cutting-edge AI for instant pronunciation feedback. The approach is designed to be not only effective but engaging. Each lesson is concise\u2014around five minutes long\u2014allowing users to effectively practice their speaking skills without a significant time commitment. With just ten minutes of daily practice, users can make noticeable improvements in their accent and fluency.\n\n**Current Initiatives and Features**\n\nRecently, BoldVoice launched the \"Accent Oracle\" on Product Hunt, a tool that detects accents just by hearing a person speak. They encourage users to try the app with a free week, featuring personalized lessons tailored to various native languages and unlimited AI feedback.\n\nTheir app has garnered significant traction, boasting over 46,000 reviews on the App Store, with an impressive average rating of 4.8/5.
