    "generated_description": "**Howdy.com: Connecting U.S. Tech Companies with Latin American Talent**\n\nFounded in 2018, Howdy.com was born out of a simple yet powerful mission: to help U.S. tech companies hire and manage software engineers based in Latin America (LATAM). What initially started as a response to the hiring challenges faced by Austin startups has evolved into a significant player in the recruiting space, especially for those looking for talent that operates within the U.S. time zones.\n\n### Key Highlights:\n- **Team and Growth**: Starting from a small operation, Howdy has scaled to over 300 employees. The company operates in various locations across the Americas, including Austin, Texas, and has established a strong foothold in the LATAM tech scene.\n- **Talent Acquisition & Management**: Howdy helps over 200 companies\u2014including well-known names like Coinbase, Truepill, and various Y Combinator startups\u2014effectively hire and build remote teams, whether in a fully remote, hybrid, or in-office setup. They give companies access to a network of vetted talent, which isn\u2019t just passively seeking jobs through freelancer platforms.\n  \n### Unique Value Proposition:\n- **Community Engagement**: By hosting local tech meetups and creating \"Howdy Houses\" throughout LATAM, Howdy fosters a community where companies can connect with promising tech leaders eager to join U.S. product teams long-term.\n- **98% Retention Rate**: Howdy\u2019s approach not only focuses on bringing the right talent into teams but also on maintaining them. Every developer hired through Howdy is provided with excellent benefits\u2014including premium health insurance, top-notch Apple equipment, gym memberships, and access to upscale office spaces. This package significantly reduces churn and promotes a stable work environment.\n\n### Services and Pricing:\nHowdy offers flexible hiring solutions across various domains like software development, AI & machine learning, data engineering, and more\u2014essentially acting as an all-in-one workforce solution. Their pricing models are clear and straightforward, ranging from $6k to $11k monthly for software developers, with similar tailored packages for other roles like finance, customer service, and design.\n\n### The Road Ahead:\nAs Howdy continues to grow, their commitment remains steadfast: enabling U.S. companies to tap into the top 1% of Latin American talent efficiently and effectively. This not only ensures high-quality hires but also gives companies a seamless way to manage and integrate these remote talents into their existing teams.\n\nIn a world where traditional hiring practices can be slow and cumbersome, Howdy simplifies the process, showing that good talent has no borders and can fill the tech talent gaps many companies face today.
