We are starting with growth, which is the most existential problem advisors face. \r\n\nThe organic growth process is highly inefficient and full of noise. Advisors often waste 60 hours of business development to convert 1 new client.  \r\n\nAt FINNY, we are certain we can do better with AI. With our tool, advisors can:\r\n- Identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead\r\n- Prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair\r\n- Automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with their high priority prospects\r\n\nIn essence, doing all the work for the advisors, and letting them focus on what actually matters, the client relationship.",

FINNY monitors life events\u2014like a job change or marriage\u2014that often trigger the need for financial advice.\n  \n- **Prospect Prioritization**: Using a unique scoring system dubbed the F-Score, prospects are ranked based on their conversion likelihood, tailoring the approach to each advisor\u2019s specific clientele.\n\n- **Automated Outreach**: FINNY AI takes on the heavy lifting by managing outreach efforts. Whether it's selecting the best channel or crafting personalized messages, the platform allows advisors to book meetings with interested clients efficiently.\n\nThis trio of capabilities means that financial advisors can focus on what they do best: nurturing client relationships.\n\n**Backed by Y Combinator**\n\nAs part of the Y Combinator Batch S24, FINNY AI recently celebrated a successful $4.3 million seed funding round, affirming its model and vision. Notably, it's on the radar of industry leaders and has received accolades for its innovative approach, including being named \"Best in Show\" at the 2024 Fintech Showcase.\n\n**Empowering the Independents**\n\nAt its core, FINNY AI champions independent financial advisors, aspiring to help them provide essential financial services to all Americans. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, they hope to cut through the noise of traditional prospecting methods and create an ecosystem where growth is not just a goal but a given.\n\nIf you're an advisor ready to revolutionize your practice, you can learn more about their offerings or book a demo at their website: [FINNY AI](https://www.finnyai.com/).\n\nIn summary, FINNY AI stands as a promising beacon for financial advisors, combining AI-driven insights with straightforward automation to redefine the way they connect with clients.
