They\u2019re tackling a huge pain point for the 30 million Americans who suffer from this sometimes debilitating condition.\n\n**Mission**  \nSoteri Skin\u2019s mission is straightforward: provide long-lasting relief for eczema and similar skin disorders without needing a prescription.

His inspiration came from witnessing the struggles of his wife and daughter with eczema and the ineffectiveness of available topical treatments. By diving into the science of skin health, Rafal discovered a critical relationship between skin pH and eczema symptoms, leading to the development of the pH/LOCK\u2122 technology.\n\n**Current Operations**  \nSoteri Skin operates with a lean team of two and emphasizes an e-commerce strategy to reach its audience effectively. Their website not only offers product sales but is also a rich resource for information on skincare and the science behind their formulations.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nSoteri Skin is making waves in the skincare industry with its unique focus on eczema and its evidence-backed approach to treatment.
