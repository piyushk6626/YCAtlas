Current approaches pursue single-gene fixes that only help small subsets of patients, leaving a multi-million patient population without effective treatment options.\r\n\nGene therapy opens the door to precisely modifying brain circuits. The problem is the elevated risk in neuroscience drug discovery. To solve this, we use a pre-clinical screening platform, multiple gene therapy candidates, and ML analytics to develop gene therapies capable of controlling neural activity and addressing neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

    "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Exin Therapeutics**\n\nFounded in 2024, Exin Therapeutics is a promising startup based in San Francisco and proudly part of Y Combinator's W25 batch. The company is on a mission to revolutionize the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders through precision genetic therapies that target neural activity at a circuit-level. \n\n**The Problem**\n\nTraditionally, the landscape of neurotherapeutics has been woefully underwhelming, particularly for the millions suffering from idiopathic neurological conditions. Existing treatments focus mostly on rare genetic causes, leaving a vast population with ineffective options. Moreover, neuroscience drug discovery is notoriously high-risk, contributing to the failure of many promising candidates.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nExin Therapeutics is taking a bold step beyond single-gene fixes. Their innovative platform leverages a combination of pre-clinical screening, machine learning analytics, and multiple gene therapy candidates to effectively tackle neural dysfunction. The aim? To develop effective gene therapies for conditions like Autism Spectrum Disorder, Epilepsy, and Parkinson\u2019s Disease, thereby addressing the critical unmet need in the neurotherapeutics market.\n\n**Team and Leadership**\n\nThe company is currently a small but mighty team of three dedicated employees. Jared Friedman serves as the group's partner, bringing invaluable guidance as they navigate this complex field.\n\n**Tags and Focus Areas**\n\nExin Therapeutics operates at the intersection of several exciting domains: gene therapy, neurotechnology, biotech, and therapeutics. Their work encapsulates a forward-thinking approach to unraveling the complexities of neural activity and boosting the efficacy of potential treatments.\n\nFor more information about their groundbreaking work, you can visit their official website at [Exin Therapeutics](https://www.exintherapeutics.com/).\n\nIn a nutshell, Exin Therapeutics is setting out to dismantle the traditional approaches to neurological treatment, heralding a new era of precision medicine that brings hope where it's most needed.",
