The reality is that most exams around the world still have little to no quality online prep material, including many taken by hundreds of thousands of students each year. Educato uses AI to generate high-quality prep content for these exams. LLMs allow us to target the profitable fat middle in the distribution of exams, historically overlooked by education companies.",

With the mission of being an AI-powered worldwide exam preparation platform, it\u2019s targeting a gap that has long been neglected: quality online prep material for exams taken by hundreds of thousands of students globally\u2014not just the top exams in the U.S.\n\nYou see, online exam prep tools have been around for decades, but they\u2019ve primarily focused on a mere handful of well-known American exams. Educato aims to change that narrative by leveraging AI to create high-quality, tailored content for a broader array of examinations. This includes everything from national exams in Romania to service exams in the Philippines and civil service exams in Nigeria. By tapping into the \"fat middle\" of the exam distribution\u2014a segment often ignored by educational companies\u2014Educato is enabling students to access personalized learning experiences that cater to their needs.\n\nCurrently a part of the Y Combinator Batch S24, Educato is backed by a team of three, with Tom Blomfield (famed for his work with Monzo) as their group partner. The platform doesn\u2019t just stop at creating study materials; it emphasizes an engaging learning experience through features like recap tests and logical reasoning questions. In a world where rote memorization has been the norm, Educato is refreshing\u2014offering a platform that emphasizes understanding over memorization.\n\nAs of now, Educato is live and supporting a variety of exams, including the ASVAB, Bar Exam, NCLEX, and even international markers like the UPSC exams in India and the Baccalaur\u00e9at in France. There's also a roster of upcoming examinations, continually expanding its reach.\n\nWhat do users think? Early feedback underscores the platform\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness, with testimonials highlighting its focus on logical reasoning and well-structured material. It appears that students are not just studying; they\u2019re truly engaging with the content\u2014that\u2019s a win.\n\nEducato AI is definitely a company to watch as it continues to grow and reshape the landscape of exam preparation, making advanced AI technology accessible to students worldwide.\n\nFor more details, check out their website: [Educato AI](https://www.educato.ai/).",
