Being part of Y Combinator's Batch W24 further endorses their innovative approach to a growing market.\n\n**Future Directions**  \nWith EV adoption surging\u201473% of drivers want charging facilities in their residences\u2014Starlight Charging actually encourages property owners to embrace EV charging as a value-adding amenity.
