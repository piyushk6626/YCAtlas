    "generated_description": "Pando Bioscience is an exciting startup at the frontier of AI and synthetic biology, founded in 2022 and proudly part of Y Combinator\u2019s Batch W23. Based in Boston, this small but dynamic team of five is on a mission to revolutionize enzyme engineering for the pharmaceutical industry through generative AI.\n\nAt its core, Pando aims to tackle the age-old challenge of optimizing enzymes\u2014those natural catalysts that are vital in various biochemical processes. The company\u2019s ultra-high-throughput screening platform is a game changer, enabling the screening of 1,000 times more enzyme variants, doing so 75% faster and at 80% lower costs than traditional methods. This efficiency allows their generative AI to tailor enzymes with high performance across multiple properties, ultimately driving down costs for pharmaceutical manufacturing and diagnostics.\n\nWhy does this matter? Developing industrial-grade enzymes that strike a balance between stability, activity, and manufacturability is not just challenging; it\u2019s crucial for market growth in pharmaceuticals. Inefficient enzymes can lead to significant financial losses and missed opportunities. With Pando's technology, the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of enzyme optimization becomes streamlined, unlocking the full potential of enzymes to enhance productivity and profitability.\n\nPando offers a range of engineered enzymes for molecular biology applications and provides tailored enzyme solutions to help clients improve their processes and outcomes. The company is heavily invested in leveraging AI for iterative enzyme improvement, making it a standout player in the biotech landscape.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about their work or looking for innovative solutions in enzyme design, check out their website at [pando.bio](https://pando.bio/) for more information. With generative AI, Pando Bioscience is not just riding the wave of biotechnology; they\u2019re setting new standards in enzyme engineering for the future.",
