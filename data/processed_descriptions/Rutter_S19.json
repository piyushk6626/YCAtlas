    "description": "Rutter is building a universal API for e-commerce platforms, accounting systems and payment processors.\r\n\nSimilar to the financial market before Plaid, the world of business financial data is split across hundreds of platforms like e-commerce storefronts, marketplaces, accounting systems and payment processors, such as Shopify, Amazon, Quickbooks, Netsuite, Stripe and others.  \r\n\nEach of these platforms has its own app store or its equivalent, and the enterprising developer must spend thousands of hours building integrations in order to access the entire market.\r\n\nRutter is an integration layer for any company building integrations into commerce or accounting platforms.

Just like Plaid unified access to the financial services realm, Rutter is creating a universal API that amalgamates data from various e-commerce platforms, accounting systems, and payment processors. Think of it as a one-stop-shop for integrating and managing financial data from popular platforms like Shopify, Amazon, QuickBooks, NetSuite, Stripe, and more.\n\n---\n\n### The Problem It Solves\n\nIn the existing landscape, developers face an uphill battle; each platform comes with its own integration requirements.

Rutter aims to eliminate that friction by being an integration layer for any company building connections into commerce or accounting platforms.\n\n---\n\n### Core Offerings\n\n1. **Unified API Model:**  \n   Rutter allows developers to ship integrations in days rather than months by offering a standardized data model across platforms.\n\n2. **Integration Features:**  \n   Rutter provides APIs for various domains such as:\n   - **Payments API**: Access transactions, subscriptions, and balances.\n   - **Accounting API**: Read financial statements, bills, and invoices.\n   - **Commerce API**: Manage orders, inventory, and customer data.\n   - **Ads API**: Dive into campaign performance and ad account insights.\n   - **Bank Feeds API**: Sync bank transactions seamlessly with customer accounting platforms.\n\n3. **Data Governance and Monitoring:**  \n   Rutter also includes features like Rutter Link for user authentication and monitoring tools for maintaining integration health.\n\n---\n\n### Use Cases and Solutions\n\nRutter offers tailored solutions for businesses looking to streamline their financial processes, including:\n\n- **Business Underwriting:** Understand financial statements, revenue, and spending.\n- **Invoicing Automation:** Sync data related to invoices efficiently.\n- **Expense Management:** Handle expenses from various financial accounts.\n- **Sales Tax Automation:** Manage sales tax data effectively.\n\n---\n\n### Why Rutter?\n\nRutter stands out by allowing companies to develop robust financial applications without reinventing the wheel.
