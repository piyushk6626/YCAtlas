Their motto is to embed good habits right into your calendar, making it easier for you to live a more organized life. You can check them out at [byviolet.com](http://www.byviolet.com).\n\nFounded in the Y Combinator Batch S19, Violet is based in New York and has a lean team of 8 employees. Even though we don\u2019t have specific numbers on their early days, the fact that they\u2019re part of Y Combinator suggests they started with a solid premise and vision.\n\nThe company is tagged with terms like 'artificial-intelligence\u2019, \u2018data-engineering\u2019, 'ai-assistant\u2019, and \u2018new-york\u2019. This indicates that their approach likely incorporates advanced technology to help users better manage their time and habits. \n\nWhile there isn\u2019t detailed information on their current offerings, the focus seems clear: they want to empower users by integrating productivity into everyday routines. In a world where time is the most valuable currency, Violet aims to be the ally you didn\u2019t know you needed.",
