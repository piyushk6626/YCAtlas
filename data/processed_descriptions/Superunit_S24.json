The company is on a mission to build an AI-powered Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system specifically designed for companies engaged in manufacturing or selling physical goods.\n\nIn just the last six weeks, Superunit has activated its first module, focusing on AI accounting and supply chain management, and it\u2019s already gained traction with seven customers. The company has secured $8.3k in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and recently signed a pilot agreement with a significant $200 million apparel company. This early traction indicates a strong product-market fit.\n\nSuperunit\u2019s offerings include automated bookkeeping, comprehensive supply chain management, inventory cost management, and insightful contribution margin analysis.
