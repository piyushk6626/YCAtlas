Based in Hyderabad, India, it carved out a niche in the online learning landscape, aiming to transform the educational and employability frameworks prevalent in the country.\n\n**Mission and Vision**  \nAt its core, Edyst was all about peer-to-peer learning, providing a platform where students could enhance their skills in a collaborative environment. The mission was clear: to shake up the conventional approaches to learning and job readiness, particularly in a rapidly evolving market.\n\n**Impressive Metrics**  \nIn just two years, Edyst achieved some remarkable statistics that many established players in the industry would envy: \n- A staggering **80% course completion rate**, which is eight times the industry average.\n- On average, students engaged with the platform for **95 minutes daily**, five times more than typical usage metrics.\n- A **50% placement ratio**, an impressive feat that is double the norm for online learning platforms.\n\nThese numbers highlight not only the effectiveness of their content but also the commitment of their learners\u2014an ecosystem fostered by dedicated mentorship and a vibrant community.\n\n**Team and Partnerships**  \nDespite its relatively small size, with a team of just 11 employees, Edyst thrived on a culture of innovation and problem-solving. They sought out mavericks\u2014individuals passionate about challenging the status quo and eager to make a lasting impact.\n\n**End of an Era**  \nUnfortunately, Edyst has announced its discontinuation. Over its operational period, it helped over **180,000 students** enhance their skills, with **40,000** securing jobs thanks to the training and opportunities it provided. The platform was more than just a learning tool; it became a crucial stepping stone for many in their career journeys.\n\nAs we reflect on Edyst, it\u2019s a reminder of the power of technology to reshape education and employment. Though it has closed its doors, the impact it made will resonate with the thousands who benefited from its resources. For any questions, former users can still reach out at team@edyst.com.\n\nFor more details, you could have visited their website at [edyst.com](https://edyst.com), but remember\u2014it\u2019s no longer operational. \n\nIn the end, the story of Edyst is one of ambition, community, and the pursuit of educational excellence, with lessons that extend beyond the platform itself.",
