    "description": "Founded in 2022 and based in San Diego, California, Cisterna Biologics is a technology company. It aims to solve some of the challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics \u2013 quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.\r\n\nCisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3\u2019 end. This assures not only 3\u2019 homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3\u2019 end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna\u2019s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.",

His PhD work was focused on mechanistic understanding of RNA folding, culminating in a seminal publication in Nature (see Bhaskaran and Russell, 2007). Since then, he has held positions of increasing responsibilities in both academia and industry. He is the author of several publications and industry patents.",

    "generated_description": "Cisterna Biologics, founded in 2022 and headquartered in San Diego, California, is tackling the pressing challenges in the biotech field, particularly in developing high-quality mRNA for therapeutic applications. As part of Y Combinator's Summer 2022 batch, this innovative technology company is set on a mission: to enhance the quality, quantity, longevity, and affordability of mRNA-based therapeutics.\n\nSo, what exactly does Cisterna bring to the table? The company leverages proprietary technologies that either eliminate contaminants at their source or replace the problematic elements entirely. For instance, to cut out double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), they employ ribozymes\u2014these are like molecular scissors that trim the mRNA to ensure its purity and efficacy. They also use a PCR-like system to amplify DNA templates without the bacterial enrichment that usually introduces endotoxin contamination. This approach allows them to ensure mRNA that\u2019s ten times higher in quality for therapeutic use.\n\nWith the mRNA technology landscape rapidly evolving, Cisterna is all about ensuring these advancements translate into real-world impact. They have a compact team of just two employees and are currently working on a pilot program, providing dT-purified and their SPEcific Capture and Cleavage (SPECC) purified mRNA to select research customers.\n\nTo summarize, Cisterna Biologics stands at the cutting edge of mRNA technology, with a clear mission to overcome the hurdles in producing high-quality mRNA that can usher in a new era of therapeutics. For more information, you can visit their website [here](http://www.cisternabx.com). Their tags\u2014synthetic biology, biotech, and therapeutics\u2014say it all about the exciting journey they\u2019re embarking on. It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on them!",
