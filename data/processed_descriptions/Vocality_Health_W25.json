    "Description": "Our app allows doctors to speak any language, removing the need for human medical interpreters in hospitals and clinics. Hospitals spend billions on in-person and remote medical interpreters, yet non-English speaking patients still struggle to get the care they need. Furthermore, existing tech solutions make mistakes and aren't secure.\r\n\nWe're building the most accurate and compliant medical language interpretation system across voice and video modalities.",
