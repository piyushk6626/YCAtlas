Founded as part of Y Combinator Batch W22, Syrona has carved a niche in the healthcare sector by focusing on the diverse health needs of women\u2014a demographic that constitutes 45% of the workforce but often faces inadequate health support.\n\n### The Mission\nSyrona Health aims to provide comprehensive healthcare solutions leveraging a virtual clinic model. This includes personalized diagnostics, telemedicine, and evidence-based self-management tools tailored to individual women's health issues, making healthcare accessible and relevant at every stage of life.\n\n### Areas of Focus\nThe company covers a broad spectrum of health concerns, including:\n- **Endometriosis**\n- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**\n- **Fertility**\n- **Parenthood**\n- **Cancer**\n- **Menopause**\n\nGiven the societal impacts of these health challenges, Syrona Health recognizes that one-size-fits-all approaches don\u2019t work. Instead, they provide tailored health management solutions that respond to unique needs, empowering women through personalized care plans and resources.\n\n### Services Offered\nSyrona emphasizes a holistic approach to health with services that include:\n- One-to-one virtual consultations\n- At-home diagnostic tests\n- Health tracking tools\n- On-demand health resources (medically reviewed articles, videos, live events)\n- Personalised care plans based on individual symptoms\n\n### The Impact\nNotably, statistics show that a staggering 60% of employees have left or contemplated leaving jobs due to inadequate family benefits. Syrona\u2019s services are not just healthcare solutions; they're a strategic asset for businesses aiming to retain talent by supporting employee well-being through significant health transitions.\n\n### Trust and Recognition\nSyrona Health is trusted by partners like NHS, Defra, and several innovative employee benefits organizations. They've received positive feedback for the transformative impact their solutions have on employee health and workplace culture, fostering inclusivity and open discussions about women's health.\n\nIn summary, Syrona Health is paving the way for a more inclusive healthcare system by providing essential support and resources for women navigating critical health transitions. Their approach isn\u2019t merely about treating symptoms; it's about empowering individuals to take control of their health journeys in meaningful and personalized ways.\n\nFor more information, check out their [website](https://syronahealth.com/).",
