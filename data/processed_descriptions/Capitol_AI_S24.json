This is an existential risk to all media brands, which is why Capitol went from zero to $1.68M in revenue during YC: all media companies need to offer THEIR OWN Perplexity-like experience to maintain their direct relationship with customers. The most trusted brand in political news and analysis, Politico, chose us to power their Politico Pro Subscription product.\r\n\nConsumers expect instant personalized answers.

By offering a sophisticated API, Capitol empowers publishers to deliver personalized search results, research reports, and even social media content all within their paywalls, thereby enhancing their relationship with users.\n\nCapitol AI experienced rapid growth, generating $1.68 million in revenue during its time at Y Combinator.

With an expansive market currently valued at $16 billion, projected to grow to $85.6 billion by 2030, Capitol AI is poised to become the critical last mile of content delivery for publishers. \n\nWith a lean team of 11 and under the guidance of Y Combinator Group Partner Garry Tan, Capitol AI is tagged in fields like artificial intelligence, workflow automation, analytics, and media.
