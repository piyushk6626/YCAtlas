Its mission is to simplify debt access for businesses, providing a seamless \u201cDebt as a Service\u201d solution. Think of Sivo as the Stripe for debt\u2014offering an API and risk protocol that enables fintechs, neobanks, and gig platforms to lend to their users swiftly and efficiently.\n\n**The Problem:**  \nTraditionally, raising debt capital is a cumbersome process\u2014often taking six months to two years, replete with complex terms and manual reporting. Many traditional funds shy away from early-stage fintechs, leaving companies in a bind when it comes to accessing necessary funds.\n\n**The Solution:**  \nSivo's approach is transformative. By leveraging technology, they allow businesses to secure up to $20 million in debt capital without the standard hurdles. Their API facilitates an interest-only payment structure that scales as businesses grow, allowing for an accelerated path to credit and reputation building. With integrations through tools like Zapier, sharing loan data becomes a breeze.\n\n**Recent Developments:**  \nLaunched in March 2023, Sivo quickly established a $100 million debt capital partnership and already boasts a customer pipeline of over 100 companies, including notable names like Uber. Their team of 15 is composed of industry veterans from high-stakes organizations like Goldman Sachs, Revolut, and NASA, giving them a deep well of experience in risk, debt, and enterprise software.\n\n**Leadership:**  \nMichael Seibel serves as the Group Partner for Sivo, guiding this dynamic venture with his wealth of knowledge and connections.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIn a world where access to capital is essential yet complex, Sivo stands out as a modern ally for businesses looking to expand their lending capabilities. With its cutting-edge technology and a clear focus on eliminating pain points in the debt acquisition process, Sivo is poised to redefine how companies think about debt financing in this digital age. \n\nFor more information, check out [Sivo's website](https://sivo.com).",
