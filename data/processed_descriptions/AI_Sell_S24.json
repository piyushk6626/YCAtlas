    "description": "We're building AI Sales Associates for eCommerce. Imagine going on nike.com and facetiming an AI Lebron James and getting his advice on which his shoes to buy. Traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores rely on sales associates to provide personalized customer service, guide product discovery and close sales, but it's always been too expensive and unscaleable for online stores. We're building video-based AI agents that are experts in their products and can gently steer customers to a purchase, delighting customers and lifting conversion/AOV.\r\n\nJerry and Jeffrey are brothers who previously worked together to scale The Coding School to a 6mil+ in revenue. Jerry built software to help run the 50+ Shopify brands that Openstore acquired more profitably and efficiently. He was also an engineer at Flexport and Google.\r\n\nJeffrey previously worked at DRW as a quant trader, and as an engineer at Facebook, Snowflake and Amazon.",

Imagine visiting a site like Nike.com and having the chance to FaceTime with an AI version of LeBron James for personalized shoe advice. This vision reflects the core of AI Sell\u2019s approach\u2014providing customers with engaging and tailored shopping experiences that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have long depended on, but in a scalable online format.\n\nFounded in 2024, AI Sell emerged from the minds of brothers Jerry and Jeffrey, who bring a wealth of experience to the table. Previously, they scaled The Coding School to over $6 million in revenue. Jerry, with a solid background in software engineering from places like Flexport and Google, developed tools to help manage multiple Shopify brands for Openstore more effectively. Jeffrey complements this with his experience as a quant trader at DRW and roles at giants such as Facebook, Snowflake, and Amazon. Together, they harness their diverse skills to tackle the challenge of personalized service in eCommerce.\n\nOperating out of San Francisco and currently part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, AI Sell is small but mighty, with a team of just two employees. Their Group Partner is Jared Friedman, who adds invaluable guidance and mentorship.\n\nIn an industry where sales and customer experiences are crucial, AI Sell is poised to innovate the way consumers interact with online shopping. By combining video technology with AI expertise, they hope to not just improve conversion rates but also enhance overall customer satisfaction through a delightful shopping journey.\n\nFor more information and to keep an eye on their progress, visit their website at [AI Sell](https://www.aisell.com). \n\n**Tags:** Sales, E-commerce, AI, San Francisco Bay Area.",
