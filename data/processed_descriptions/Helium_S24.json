    "generated_description": "**Helium: Revolutionizing Paywall Management with AI**\n\nFounded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Helium is on a mission to create self-improving software that intelligently optimizes user experiences to boost revenue. Think of it as an AI that\u2019s not just smart, but constantly learning and adapting to better serve users and businesses alike.\n\nThe company kicked off its journey by partnering with a social app boasting 20 million monthly active users (MAU), helping them test and refine their in-app paywalls to enhance subscription rates. It\u2019s a smart approach\u2014by experimenting on key moments in the user funnel, Helium aims to turn casual users into loyal subscribers with minimal developer intervention.\n\n### The Team Behind the Magic\nHelium is led by a trio of growth-savvy co-founders:\n- **Zach Witzel**: Formerly at Uber, he has engineered over $100 million in growth experiments.\n- **Shishir Jakati**: An ex-Amazon employee who pioneered large language model features for Alexa.\n- **Anish Doshi**: Known for improving Instagram ads conversion by 10% through machine learning at Meta.\n\nTogether, they bring a wealth of experience in AI and growth hacking, which they leverage to help businesses scale effectively.\n\n### What Helium Does\nHelium\u2019s platform allows businesses to manage their paywalls without needing extensive coding knowledge. Here\u2019s what sets them apart:\n\n- **Visual Editing**: Users can edit their paywall UI and content through a visual editor, making the optimization process seamless.\n- **Rapid Implementation**: New paywalls can be triggered anywhere in an app with a simple line of code\u2014`Helium.showPaywall('onboarding');`. This reduces the friction that often comes with developer teams iterating on user experiences.\n- **Experimentation Made Easy**: Businesses can easily set up A/B tests, even going beyond simple comparisons to sophisticated multivariate tests.\n\n### Get in Touch\nIf you\u2019re looking to enhance your paywall strategy and improve conversions at lightning speed, Helium invites you to book a demo. They\u2019re currently operating with a lean team of just three and are eager to showcase how their technology can work for you.\n\nYou can find more information and get on their waitlist at [Helium's website](https://tryhelium.com).\n\nHelium is not just building software; they\u2019re crafting an intelligent growth partner for businesses that want to thrive in a competitive landscape.
