We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren\u2019t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we\u2019ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\nMore recently, we\u2019re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

Before Bountiful came onto the scene, predicting crop yields was fraught with inaccuracies; the grape yield prediction error rate was a staggering 30%. Many farmers, particularly in the specialty crops sector, relied on outdated methods like pencil and paper, which delayed critical insights and led to significant waste and inefficiency.\n\nSeeing this as a problem ripe for innovation, the founders set out to harness the power of advanced data science. They developed a platform that integrates machine learning with a plethora of data sources\u2014weather patterns, satellite imagery, geographical factors, and historical trends\u2014allowing farmers to forecast their yields with remarkable accuracy. Today, Bountiful boasts a 95% accuracy rate in predicting yields for specialty crops, and its insights are causing ripples of positive change across the agricultural value chain.\n\nBountiful offers a suite of solutions including:\n\n- **Bountiful OS**: This is their core operating system designed to consolidate critical farming data\u2014from production and quality metrics to costs and forecasting\u2014into a single platform, streamlining operations for farmers.\n  \n- **Bountiful Agriculture**: Farmers receive ongoing, data-driven yield forecasts that adapt throughout the growth season, transforming farming decisions.\n  \n- **Bountiful Market**: A marketplace connecting farmers with the latest market insights and trends, helping them make informed decisions about what to plant and sell.\n\nAs part of Y Combinator\u2019s Batch W17, Bountiful is backed by a seasoned group of experts and has successfully grown to a tight-knit team of four passionate employees.
