    "description": "GrowthBook is an open source platform to help companies make data-driven product decisions with feature flags and A/B tests.  \r\n\nExisting SaaS solutions like LaunchDarkly require a company to send all of their data to them. This results in high costs, data compliance issues, and vendor lock-in.  As a result, many companies end up building their own platforms in-house, which can take thousands of hours of work and lots of headaches.  To solve this, GrowthBook uses a company's existing data infrastructure and business metrics.\r\n\nWe believe feature flags and experimentation are the right way to build products at scale and that they will become a standard part of the development process.  GrowthBook is well positioned to be a leader in this growing market.",
