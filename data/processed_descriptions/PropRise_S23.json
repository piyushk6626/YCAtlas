Among them are co-founders Jean-Michael Diei (CEO) and Matthew Krager (CTO), along with Kenny Sandon as Director of Sales. They\u2019re supported by Jared Friedman as their Group Partner at Y Combinator, where PropRise was part of the Batch S23 program.\n\n**User Testimonials**  \nThe value of PropRise speaks volumes through the words of its users.
