Jake, the Founder, is a former Navy SEAL and understands the market and product. Our Chief Science Officer, Karl Guttag, is an industry leader in the optics and display space. Our VPs of Software and Hardware are both very experienced in their fields. Our primary technology focus is on peer-to-peer applications, near eye optics and displays, cameras/sensors/IoT, and UI/UX (hardware and software).",
