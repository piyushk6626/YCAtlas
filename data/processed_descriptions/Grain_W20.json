Born in 2017 out of the founders\u2019 frustration with conventional credit systems, Grain\u2019s mission is to transform debit cards into credit cards by linking them to a line of credit informed by real cash flow. This offers a lifeline to millennials, Gen Zs, and immigrants\u2014essentially, about 100 million people\u2014who often fear falling into the quagmire of credit card debt.\n\nAfter initially rolling out their consumer credit app\u2014which for six years served around 470,000 users\u2014Grain pivoted in 2023 to focus on two new flagship products: **Velex** and **Atlas**. Velex provides an automated cash-flow scoring solution, allowing financial institutions to assess borrower risk more effectively, while Atlas serves as a comprehensive portfolio management tool for various loan types and credit services.\n\nGrain stands out not just for its innovative approach but also for its commitment to financial inclusivity. By simplifying access to credit, they\u2019re aiming to democratize financial opportunities for those previously marginalized by traditional banking norms. With a team of 30, Grain is part of Y Combinator's Batch W20, suggesting that they\u2019re not just a vision, but a startup with the backing and potential to make significant waves in the finance sector.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fresh perspective on credit options and financial management, Grain seems well-poised to be a player worth watching.  \n\nYou can explore more about their offerings at [trygrain.com](https://trygrain.com).",
