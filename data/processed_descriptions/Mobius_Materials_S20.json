The intent is to streamline the often cumbersome process of hardware sourcing and minimize the financial waste that comes from excess inventory.\n\n#### Services Offered\nMobius acts as a B2B marketplace where electronics manufacturers can:\n- Quickly buy and sell bulk electronic components\n- Access a range of verified parts from reputable manufacturers, with significant savings up to 70%\n- Source rare components, particularly useful during shortages\n\nTheir platform also addresses the common challenges manufacturers face: sourcing too few parts can lead to rushed re-orders, while over-sourcing can result in substantial financial loss. By connecting buyers with sellers of excess inventory, Mobius alleviates the risks associated with both underbuying and overbuying.\n\n#### Industry Focus\nMobius is part of the broader hardware, manufacturing, and supply chain sectors, with a particular emphasis on semiconductors. The company has identified a critical need in the electronics industry\u2014 the overwhelming issue of waste and inefficiency in component sourcing.\n\n#### Key Individuals\n- **Founder & CEO:** Margaret Upshur, who has practical experience from her past as an operations head in an IoT module manufacturing context. She identified first-hand the problems of excess components, leading to the creation of Mobius.\n- **Group Partner:** Gustaf Alstromer, a notable figure in the startup ecosystem.\n\n#### Unique Selling Proposition\nMobius stands out by ensuring that all components are sourced from vetted suppliers, with every part authenticated and tested. This rigorous approach fosters trust and reliability, a critical need in an industry riddled with counterfeiting risks and supply chain uncertainties.\n\n### Notable Testimonials\nMobius has received positive feedback, with partners highlighting its effectiveness in reducing costs and excess inventory. Some have noted substantial cost savings\u2014around 25%\u2014from swapping out ill-fitting components on their bills of materials (BOM).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn a world where hardware sourcing is increasingly challenging, Mobius Materials is carving out a significant niche. By prioritizing efficiency and reliability, they hope not just to solve problems for manufacturers but also to elevate the way electronic components are traded globally.
