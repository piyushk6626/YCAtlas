Many clinics focus on teaching patients how to better cope with symptoms, which is helpful, but we don\u2019t stop there.  We develop collaborations & partnerships so our patients access to the most promising testing and root-cause directed early therapies for their illness(es) with the goal of simplifying and streamlining the most efficient and effective clinical pathways so they can be scaled in the form of low cost online modules overseen remotely by clinicians.  \r\n\nIn conjunction with clinical care, RTHM operates a clinical lab and collects deep molecular data with robust clinical context to develop AI-powered diagnostics and better ways of predicting which treatments may work best for whom.",
