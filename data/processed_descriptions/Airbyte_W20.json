My team built and scaled over 1,000 data ingestion and distribution connectors to replicate hundreds of TB of data every day. \n\nAfter LiveRamp\u2019s acquisition and later IPO (NYSE:RAMP), I joined rideOS as Director of Engineering, again deep in data. There, I realized that all companies are trying to solve the same problem.\n\nAirbyte was born.",
