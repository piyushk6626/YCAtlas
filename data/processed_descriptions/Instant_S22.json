We followed two rules initially 1) Build something we want for ourselves and 2) Make something more ambitious than previously. Since 2021 we added a third rule, 3) Make it a business. To that end we launched Jobsearch.dev, ExportHealth, Zeneca, Consistent, and now work on Instant, the modern Firebase",

I started off my career building a startup in China, and soon joined Wit.ai to work on an API for natural language processing. We used a suite of interesting tools, like Clojure, which heavily influenced my software design philosophy. We were acquired by Facebook. After 4 years, I had a stint at Airbnb, and decided to start Instant with my best friend. I also love to write; you can read some essays on my blog: stopa.io",
