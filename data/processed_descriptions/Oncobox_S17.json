    "description": "Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would most effectively fight individual patients\u2019 specific cancers. That\u2019s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.\r\n\nHow does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don\u2019t always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can\u2019t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.\r\n\nOncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.\r\n\nWe actively seek partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. Feel free to contact us at hello@oncobox.com. \r\n\nOur team and the scientific advisory board consisting of leading scientists and researchers from UCLA, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Boston University, Tufts University, and Rutgers University.",

    "generated_description": "## Oncobox: Revolutionizing Cancer Treatment \n\n**Mission**: Oncobox is dedicated to finding the right cancer drug for each patient, leveraging tailor-made solutions for personalizing treatment.\n\n### What They Do:\n\nOncobox started with a clear goal: to address the critical need for a data-driven approach in cancer treatment. Many late-stage cancer patients face the daunting reality of ineffective treatments, often suffering due to the lack of targeted therapy options tailored to their unique genetic makeup. Oncobox's solution? Affordable personalized genetic profiling.\n\n**How It Works**:\n- Oncobox Dx analyzes tumor DNA and RNA, focusing on essential molecular pathways and genetic profiles.\n- This sophisticated analysis helps clinicians identify the most effective targeted therapies from over 150 available on the market.\n- They deliver a clinically actionable report that provides a ranked list of medications likely to benefit specific patients, significantly increasing the effectiveness of treatment.\n\n### Impact:\n\nIn a clinical study involving 900 late-stage cancer patients, Oncobox improved the effectiveness of targeted therapies from a mere 25% to an impressive 64%. This kind of data-driven tool is a game changer, as it helps mitigate the risks of ineffective drug trials.\n\n**Partnerships**: The company actively collaborates with pharmaceutical firms, hospitals, payers, and genomic centers to better integrate their innovative solutions into the healthcare landscape.\n\n### Team and Collaboration:\n\nLocated in Walnut, CA, and part of Y Combinator\u2019s S17 batch, Oncobox boasts a team of 11 skilled employees and a scientific advisory board with experts from prestigious institutions like UCLA and Johns Hopkins University.\n\n### The Bigger Picture:\n\nWhile oncology can often feel like a minefield of trial and error, Oncobox is making strides toward a more precise and efficient approach. By utilizing cutting-edge genomic technologies and machine learning, it\u2019s paving the way for what they call \u201cdeep molecular profiling,\u201d moving beyond guesswork and toward a future where cancer care is centered around the individual's molecular data.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOncobox is more than just a diagnostics company; it\u2019s a beacon of hope for late-stage cancer patients, offering tailored solutions that could transform their treatment journey.
