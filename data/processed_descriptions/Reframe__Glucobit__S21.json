    "generated_description": "Reframe (also known as Glucobit) is a revolutionary app grounded in neuroscience and psychology with a clear mission: to help people reduce or quit their alcohol use. Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S21, Reframe has rapidly established itself as a global leader in this space, boasting over 2 million users in the last year alone.\n\nHeadquartered in Atlanta, GA, Reframe's team of 35 is dedicated to creating a stigma-free environment for individuals seeking to change their relationship with alcohol. Their approach is not about enforcing restrictions but rather fostering new habits through evidence-based methods. They have developed an all-in-one platform that integrates a behavior change program, practical tools, and a supportive community atmosphere.\n\nWith a user-centric design, Reframe offers features like a personalized drink tracker, in-depth courses on mindful drinking, and a 24/7 anonymous community to connect users who are on similar journeys. Impressively, within just three months, 91% of users have reported a significant decrease in their alcohol consumption.\n\nThe app has garnered 3.25 million downloads and more than 31,000 five-star reviews, illustrating its effectiveness and popularity among those looking to lead healthier lives. Reframe isn't just an app; it's a movement toward better mental health and consumer well-being in an increasingly alcohol-centric culture.\n\nTo learn more and get started, check out their website [here](https://www.joinreframeapp.com/).",
