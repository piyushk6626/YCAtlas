    "generated_description": "Callisto is a nonprofit tech startup committed to combating sexual assault and providing vital support to survivors. Founded in 2014 and part of Y Combinator Batch W18, Callisto launched its online system in 2015, primarily operating across over 40 college campuses in the U.S. The company, based in San Francisco, aims to create technology that detects serial sexual offenders and connects survivors for mutual support.\n\nThe core of Callisto\u2019s innovation lies in its unique platform, the Callisto Vault, which allows survivors to securely document their experiences and potentially match with others who may have encountered the same perpetrator. This way, survivors can gather strength in their shared experiences, fostering a sense of community and increasing accountability for serial offenders.\n\nIn 2020, Callisto expanded its offerings by integrating legal services with its matching escrow system, ensuring comprehensive support for survivors during a delicate time. This dual approach equips users not only with a safe space to report but also with legal avenues to explore if they choose to take action against their assailants.\n\nWith a small but dedicated team of just seven employees, Callisto has an ambitious mission: to extend its resources to every survivor in the country, facilitating a safer environment on campuses and ultimately reducing incidents of sexual assault.\n\nTheir overarching message is clear: Callisto exists to empower survivors and provide them with the tools and support they need to reclaim their narratives, making a significant stride toward a world where sexual violence is systematically addressed and perpetrators held accountable.\n\nVisit [Callisto's website](https://www.projectcallisto.org) to learn more about their work, find support, or get involved in their mission.",
