    "generated_description": "DigiBuild is on a mission to cut through the chaos that often plagues the construction supply chain\u2014a sector where a staggering 70% of projects run late or over budget, primarily due to inefficient management of building materials. Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S21, the Miami-based company leverages machine learning to help construction contractors buy, track, and manage materials seamlessly from suppliers to job sites.\n\nAt its core, DigiBuild simplifies a historically cumbersome process. Through its platform, construction companies can efficiently find, order, and manage materials, ultimately saving them both time and money while improving project timelines. In a market where material costs have skyrocketed\u2014up 20% since 2020\u2014and lead times have extended by 50%, this kind of efficiency is not just nice to have; it\u2019s necessary.\n\nDigiBuild works with some of the leading real estate developers, general contractors, and subcontractors across the U.S., managing billions in materials annually in the world's second-largest construction market. With a compact team of 15, DigiBuild focuses on providing tools that enhance material visibility and streamline procurement. Their offerings include DigiProcure and DigiEndeavour, tailored solutions that cut material procurement hours in half and automate many of the tedious tasks project managers face.\n\nThe challenge in construction isn\u2019t just about getting the right materials; it\u2019s about preventing delays and ensuring that projects stay on budget. DigiBuild addresses these needs with predictive scheduling features that flag key ordering dates and help avoid mismanagement.\n\nFor those interested in learning more, whether you're a contractor looking for a competitive edge or a stakeholder aiming to better understand the supply chain, you can explore DigiBuild\u2019s offerings on their [website](https://digibuild.com). They are bridging gaps in an industry that desperately needs it\u2014one project at a time.",
