Conversely, over the past decade, currency depreciation across the region has become unsustainable. (some countries surpassing the trillion percent ). \r\n\nKontigo solves this with a USDC global wallet & a BTC savings account. \r\n\n- Like Venmo, but on-USDC.\r\n- Like Zelle, but for cross-border payments. No limits.\r\n- Like Nubank & Revolut, but without inflationary currencies. Bitcoin-backed.\r\n\nUser wallets are connected to an AI-private banker on WhatsApp to execute international USDC transactions.",

The platform's user-friendly approach, coupled with 24/7 support, positions Kontigo as a reliable place for managing finances without the burden of inflationary currency.\n\n**Backers and Network**  \nKontigo's promising future is backed by significant investors such as DST Global, Soma Capital, Pioneer Fund, and a roster of 10 Y Combinator alumni.
