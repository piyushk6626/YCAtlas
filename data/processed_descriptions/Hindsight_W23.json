Now part of Y Combinator's W23 cohort, this startup tackles a critical issue: 85% of reasons for closed-loss opportunities tracked in CRMs are inaccurate or incomplete.

Hindsight functions as a similar coach for sales teams, allowing them to collect objective insights from both deal teams and buyers at pivotal stages\u2014when deals are won, lost, or churned.

Their offerings include:\n\n1. **AI Deal Reviews** \u2013 Seamlessly integrate with HubSpot or Salesforce to pull in deals and assess key decision-making drivers.\n2. **AI Win-Loss Interviews** \u2013 Conduct feedback surveys and live interviews with prospects, using context-aware AI to ensure relevant questions are asked each time.\n3. **AI Competitive Research** \u2013 Automate research tasks such as gathering competitor reviews or monitoring community sentiment through an AI assistant.\n\nThey promise not just better data but also faster learning\u2014helping teams identify mistakes and uncover new opportunities, with potential win rate increases of up to 15%.\n\nThe company is firmly rooted in the B2B sales enablement landscape, armed with a robust understanding of buyer priorities and competitive dynamics. Hindsight's tools aim to uncover actionable insights that lead to improved product roadmaps, sales processes, and competitive positioning.\n\nIn short, if you want to learn from your sales efforts effectively, Hindsight offers the means to do that without relying on guesswork or outdated data.   \n\nFor more insights and to get started with their solutions, check out their website: [Hindsight](https://www.usehindsight.com/).",
