I immediately recognized the untapped potential of smart eyewear. I built my first pair of smart glasses in 2021, then again in 2022. Today, the hardware is finally ready for mass-adoption, but the software - the final requirement for mass adoption - is not. That's what we're building at Mentra.",

I then started building smart glasses tech, but learned the hardware wasn't there, the AI wasn't there, and the operating system wasn't there. Now after six years, the hardware has arrived and the AI has arrived, but there's still no smart glasses operating system. I dropped out of the MIT Media Lab and started Mentra to build the last piece needed to unlock the next human computer interface.",
