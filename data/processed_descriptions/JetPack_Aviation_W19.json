Headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with a small but passionate team of nine employees, JPA\u2019s mission is straightforward: to create flying motorcycles.\n\nInitially, the focus was on developing compact, fast, heavy-lift optionally piloted VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft. Their innovative designs eliminate traditional rotor systems, making their vehicles safe for urban environments. Imagine shipping goods from downtown LA to downtown San Diego in just 20 minutes\u2014this capability is not far off with JPA's technology.\n\nThe company boasts a robust engineering operation with over a decade of experience in creating turbine-powered micro VTOLs. Everything from design to prototyping and manufacturing happens in-house. Their Jetpacks, which have made appearances in films, commercials, and high-adrenaline events like Red Bull air races, position JPA as a leader in this exciting domain.\n\nExcitingly, JPA has developed the *SPEEDER AUV*, an aircraft designed for versatility and rapid logistics. For those eager to experience the thrill of flying, JetPack Aviation also offers opportunities to fly their jetpacks through training programs.\n\nRegularly engaging with their community via platforms like [Facebook](http://www.jetpackaviation.com/<https:/www.facebook.com/jetpackaviation>), [Youtube](http://www.jetpackaviation.com/<https:/www.youtube.com/jetpackaviation>), [Instagram](http://www.jetpackaviation.com/<https:/www.instagram.com/jetpackaviation/>), and [Twitter](http://www.jetpackaviation.com/<https:/twitter.com/jetpackaviation>), JPA is not only innovating in the skies but also building a brand that resonates with enthusiasts and futurists alike.\n\nFor more information, you can explore their offerings and vision at their website: [jetpackaviation.com](http://www.jetpackaviation.com).\n\nIn essence, JetPack Aviation is not just building flying machines; they're creating a new paradigm for personal and commercial flight.
