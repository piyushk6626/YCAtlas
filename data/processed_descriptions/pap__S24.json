    "description": "Consumers miss out on $70B+ every year because they're busy and unaware, and that money is sitting in their email inbox. So, we automated reading email receipts and claiming the money they're entitled to, offering a service to which you can sign up once, do (literally) nothing, and earn $.\r\n\nWhere is this money coming from?\r\n\n- Retailers: When the price of clothes or furniture you've already bought drops, you're entitled to a refund for the difference\r\n- Airlines: When a flight you've booked gets delayed or canceled, you're entitled to a cash compensation.\r\n- Enterprises: When a class-action lawsuit is filed against a company you engage with, you're entitled to money.\r\n- And many more, that even the government holds some of your unclaimed funds.\r\n\nToday, the dream of one service that automatically claims the money you deserve when you shop, fly,... and live is (finally) possible.\r\n\nWe started with automating refunds in the shopping industry and have secured $8,000 in refunds to our users, growing 233% MoM. With AI, we've been able to repurpose that same automation to tackle refunds in the flight industry and the class-action lawsuit landscape.\r\n\nWhy us? (1) We're obsessed with reclaiming what's rightfully yours: Kamal and Anthony grew up in Lebanon, where people's money was unfairly taken away. (2) Weijie was the lead infra engineer for Wish's recommendation system, the feature that fueled their IPO. Our combined experience includes Apple, Addepar, Bolt, Wish, and StackAdapt.\r\n\nAnd we're all working towards one goal: move those billions of dollars where they belong.",
