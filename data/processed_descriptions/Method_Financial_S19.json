Their work is categorized under fintech, SaaS, and B2B, indicating a robust focus on business solutions rather than just consumer-facing products. They cater to various financial actors\u2014lenders, banks, credit unions, and even healthcare employers\u2014all of whom rely on Method\u2019s powerful API for better customer experiences.\n\nWhat truly sets Method apart is their emphasis on data integrity and security.
