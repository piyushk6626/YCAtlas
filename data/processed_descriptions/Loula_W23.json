Prior to starting Loula, I studied CS at Stanford and was a software engineer at Lyft and Stripe. When I'm not working on Loula, I'm throwing pottery, riding my bike, watching tv, or decorating my apartment :)",

Doulas, who typically work outside of traditional healthcare frameworks, often find themselves overwhelmed with the complexities of billing and insurance when they try to accept Medicaid/Medi-Cal. Loula steps in to simplify this, allowing doulas to focus on what they do best\u2014providing support to families during critical times.\n\n### What Does Loula Do?\n\nInitially launched as a software platform and national provider network, Loula takes care of essential administrative tasks such as:\n\n- **Credentialing and Contracting**: Doulas can get set up to accept Medicaid faster by filling out just one form. Loula manages the bizarre tangles of contracting with multiple health plans.\n- **Revenue Cycle Management**: Forget about billing codes and cumbersome paperwork. When a doula submits their visits through the Loula Portal, Loula handles the entire billing process, ensuring that payments are deposited into their accounts every two weeks.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Apply**: Interested doulas chat with the Loula team to determine if it's a good fit.\n2. **Onboard**: A quick online form gets them set up on Loula's platform\u2014about 15 minutes of their time.\n3. **Practice**: Within 6-12 weeks, they can start taking Medicaid clients under Loula's umbrella.\n\n### Current Focus\n\nLoula is initially catering to doulas in California, with plans to expand into other states that cover doula services in their Medicaid benefits. While they're currently a two-person operation, their impact is poised to grow significantly as they help doulas navigate the often convoluted waters of Medicaid. \n\n### Why Loula Matters\n\nThe support they provide is more than just administrative; it enhances access to vital perinatal care for families who rely on Medicaid. By lifting the burdens of insurance from doulas, Loula not only empowers these caregivers but also improves the overall quality of care clients receive during birth and postpartum.\n\nIn a world where quality birth support can too often be sidelined by bureaucratic hurdles, Loula represents a fresh, vital solution. \n\nFor more information, check out their website [here](https://joinloula.com).",
