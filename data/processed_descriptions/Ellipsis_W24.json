Their mission is straightforward: to help development teams merge code 13% faster by automating the tedious, error-prone parts of the coding process.\n\nAt its core, Ellipsis utilizes large language model (LLM) agents to automatically review pull requests, catching logical errors, security vulnerabilities, and enforcing style guide compliance\u2014all the heavy lifting that can bog down even the most seasoned developers. Once an issue is flagged, developers can simply tag `@ellipsis-dev` in their comments to have the AI implement a fix, executing code in real-time, much like a human would. This means developers can generate functional, tested code directly from platforms like GitHub and GitLab.\n\n### Key Features\n- **AI Code Reviews:** Automatically spot logical mistakes, anti-patterns, and style violations.\n- **Async Code Generation:** Assign tasks through GitHub comments and receive working code shortly after.\n- **Question and Answer:** Directly interact with Ellipsis by tagging it in comments for quick queries.\n- **Style Guide Enforcement:** Write your style guide in natural language, and Ellipsis will flag violations.\n- **Change Logs:** Generate weekly summaries that explain what changed in your codebase and why it matters.\n\nEllipsis supports over 20 programming languages and has already reviewed more than 2.1K commits daily, gaining traction with over 9,300 developers across 29,000 codebases. \n\n### Security and Accessibility\nThe company places a high value on security, being SOC 2 Type 1 certified and ensuring no data retention of your source code beyond necessary processing.
