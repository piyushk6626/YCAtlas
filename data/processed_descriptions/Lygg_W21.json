There are two reasons for this. First, most people don\u2019t know that most skin aging is caused by cumulative sun exposure, even on cloudy days. And second, sunscreens are greasy. At Lygg, we\u2019ve developed new ingredients that can triple the anti-aging protection of sunscreens and eliminate their greasiness. Our goal is to make wearing sunscreen a part of everyone\u2019s daily routine.",

    "generated_description": "### Lygg: Building New Sunscreen Ingredients\n\n**Mission:** At its core, Lygg is about revolutionizing how we think about sunscreen. With up to 90% of skin aging being attributed to UV exposure, their goal is to make wearing sunscreen a daily ritual. The problem? Most people are either unaware of the cumulative effects of sun exposure or deterred by the greasy texture of traditional sunscreens. Lygg is tackling these issues head-on by developing new ingredients that can triple the anti-aging protection while eliminating greasiness.\n\n**Founded:** Lygg was established in 2020 and is part of the Y Combinator Batch W21, placing it within a robust startup ecosystem ripe for innovation.\n\n**Location:** Based in Palo Alto, California, Lygg is positioned in the heart of Silicon Valley\u2014a hotbed for tech and biotech advancements.\n\n**Team:** The company is currently a one-person operation, highlighting the intense focus and ambition of its founder.
