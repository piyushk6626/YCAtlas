    "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Pax**\n\nPax is an innovative startup on a mission to become the leading AI broker for import tax refunds, also known as duty drawbacks. Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, Pax has quickly positioned itself as a game-changer in the world of financial reclamation for retailers and manufacturers, particularly those with annual revenues under $50 million.\n\n**The Problem They Solve**\n\nEach year, there's a staggering $15 billion worth of eligible refunds that go unclaimed, with estimates suggesting that as much as 80% of duty drawbacks are overlooked. This represents a significant revenue loss for businesses. Pax addresses this issue head-on, offering businesses an automated solution that can help them reclaim 3-5% of their revenue by tapping into these unclaimed funds.\n\n**What Makes Pax Unique?**\n\n- **AI-Powered Technology:** Pax uses sophisticated algorithms designed to identify the maximum recoverable duties, which reportedly generate 15% more refunds than the current industry leader. This advanced technology cuts processing times down by a remarkable 99%, allowing businesses to get their money back faster and more efficiently than ever before.\n  \n- **Expert Founders:** The founding team consists of two tech-savvy individuals. Penny, who holds a PhD from MIT, has experience as a research scientist at both Amazon and Flexport, where she witnessed the inefficiencies in duty drawback processes firsthand. Chris, a second-time founder and former software engineer for tech giants like Amazon, Brex, and TikTok, complements her expertise.\n\n**Current Status and Future Plans**\n\nIn just four weeks since launching, Pax has secured nearly $200,000 in contracts, illustrating strong demand for their service. This promising start, combined with their unique offering and the backing of Y Combinator, puts Pax in a favorable position for growth in the fast-paced tech and finance landscape.\n\n**Get Involved**\n\nIf you're a retailer or manufacturer looking to streamline your duty drawback process, Pax offers free consultations. You can learn more about their innovative solutions by visiting their website at [paxai.com](https://paxai.com/).\n\nIn summary, Pax is positioned to redefine how businesses approach import tax refunds, leveraging AI to unlock significant revenue opportunities while saving time and effort. With a strong foundation and a clear vision, they might just be the company that transforms the duty drawback landscape.",
