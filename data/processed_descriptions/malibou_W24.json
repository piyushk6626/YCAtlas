It was time for a change, to finally bring payroll and HR at the same place. \r\n\nDue to increasing competition in the space, French payroll engines have just opened their APIs. This allows us to offer a unified payroll and HR solution, which wasn't possible before.",

Some key capabilities include:\n- Instant payroll processing and compliance checks\n- Time management to oversee working hours and compensation\n- Centralized management for absences and remote work\n- Structured interview campaigns with templates\n- Expense tracking and reimbursements\n- Direct chat support with a dedicated payroll expert\n\n**Target Market:** The software caters to various company sizes, be it 5-20 employees, 20-50 employees, or over 50 employees, making it suitable for a wide range of SMBs in France.\n\n**Tags:** Malibou is tagged as B2B, productivity, HR-tech, payroll, and SMB.\n\n**Funding:** The company is a part of Y Combinator Batch W24, indicating a solid foundation and support structure for scaling its operations.\n\n**Website:** For more details, you can check Malibou's website at [Malibou](https://www.malibou.co).\n\nIn short, Malibou is redefining how payroll and HR are managed in the French SMB landscape by providing a comprehensive, integrated solution that simplifies these critical business functions.",
