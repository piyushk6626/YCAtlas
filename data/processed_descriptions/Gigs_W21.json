From fintechs launching mobile services to HRIS platforms offering work phone plans, we automate phone plan provisioning.\r\n\nWe're solving complex technical, operational and regulatory challenges to make connectivity truly effortless. We've grown to a team of around 90 people across the US and Europe, bringing together an experienced team of early-stage engineers, product builders and business athletes from companies like Stripe, Airbnb and Shopify. We know what it takes to solve hard problems.\r\n\nWith almost $100MM in funding from Ribbit Capital, Google and Y Combinator, Gigs is one of the fastest growing tech companies. Building on our strong foundation, we\u2019re looking for exceptional candidates who want to do the best work of their lives in a high-paced environment, surrounded by a highly talented, ambitious team.\r\n\nYou\u2019ll be joining at an exciting inflection point in our company\u2019s history. At sub-100 people and with a year of hyper-growth ahead of us, opportunity is abundant.",
