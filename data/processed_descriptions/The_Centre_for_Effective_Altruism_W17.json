    "generated_description": "The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) is a non-profit organization based in Oxford, UK, that operates in the realm of effective altruism\u2014a philosophy and social movement that promotes using evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to help others. The CEA's mission is simple yet profound: to help you maximize the impact of your charitable efforts, whether through time or financial contributions.\n\nThe organization emerged from the effective altruism movement, which emphasizes the importance of evaluating charitable interventions based on their effectiveness. This approach isn\u2019t just about recommending a charity but getting you to think critically about which causes are most worthy of your support. The goal? To make giving not just an act of kindness, but a strategic effort to make the world a better place, effectively and efficiently.\n\nFounded in Y Combinator's W17 batch, the Centre for Effective Altruism currently has a lean team of 15 dedicated to various initiatives within this philosophy. The work includes facilitating a rich tapestry of educational resources\u2014from introductory seminars and online courses to a wealth of articles, podcasts, and books geared toward empowering individuals to do more with their careers and charitable donations.\n\nAmong their notable projects and initiatives is the \"80,000 Hours\" program, which emphasizes the importance of your career in maximizing your positive impact. They also provide charity recommendations through the \"Giving What We Can\" community, striving to connect donors with high-impact organizations. \n\nThe effective altruism community isn't just a singular entity; it encapsulates a diverse network of individuals and organizations globally, working collaboratively to address the world's pressing problems\u2014ranging from global poverty to existential risks posed by emerging technologies. \n\nFor more insights, references, and to get involved, you can explore their website at [effectivealtruism.org](http://effectivealtruism.org). The centre\u2019s motto resonates throughout their work and philosophy: it's about doing good, better.",
