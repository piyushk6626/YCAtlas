    "generated_description": "# Rocketable: The AI Maximalist Software Holding Company\n\nFounded in **2023** and based in **San Francisco**, Rocketable is positioning itself at the forefront of an impending revolution in software management. As part of **Y Combinator Batch W25**, the company is laser-focused on creating a substantial portfolio of highly profitable software businesses. How do they plan to do this? By acquiring existing products and replacing human teams with **AI agents**.\n\n## Mission and Vision\n\nRocketable is driven by the belief that today's advanced AI models possess the necessary intelligence to automate most tasks required for running a software business. They envision a future where every human role can be replicated by AI, allowing companies to operate entirely without human employees. The crux of their strategy lies in not just deploying AI agents but ensuring they work in harmony toward common objectives.\n\nTo achieve this, Rocketable is developing tools that facilitate:\n- **Collaboration** across different functions of the business.\n- **Feedback mechanisms** tied to product metrics.\n- **Training** that empowers AI to make resource allocation decisions.\n\n## The Process\n\nRocketable\u2019s approach is straightforward but ambitious:\n1. **Acquire** an existing software product.\n2. **Replace** its human employees with specially designed AI agents.\n3. **Iterate** until these AI agents achieve consistently superior performance.\n4. **Repeat** this cycle at a larger scale.\n\nThis process aims to unlock what they refer to as **superhuman outcomes**: higher-quality products that customers love, developed faster and at a fraction of current costs.\n\n## The Future of Software Companies\n\nThe overarching vision is bold\u2014imagining a world where single-person, billion-dollar software companies are not just dreams but reality. Rocketable believes that well-crafted, coordinated AI can revolutionize software management, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\n\nAs part of their mission, they invite existing software product owners (with at least **$100K in annual profit**) to consider selling their products and encourage talented individuals with AI and automation skills to apply to help craft best-in-class AI agents.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRocketable is poised to redefine what it means to run a software company. By leveraging AI to replace traditional work structures, they are not just betting on the future\u2014they're actively creating it. If you're interested in learning more or keeping up with their journey, check out their website [Rocketable](https://www.rocketable.com).\n\nIn a rapidly evolving landscape, Rocketable is an emblem of what's possible when AI meets ambition.",
