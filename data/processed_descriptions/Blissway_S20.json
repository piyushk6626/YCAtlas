With a lean team of 18, it's on a mission to establish the tolling industry's prime tech infrastructure.\n\nToll collection, as it stands today, primarily relies on cumbersome gantries and transponders\u2014an outdated model that raises costs and driver inconvenience. Blissway is flipping this script. Instead of relying on traditional overhead structures, they\u2019ve introduced the Wireless Autonomous Lane Enforcer (WAL-E), a smart solution that enables more efficient and reliable tolling processes right from the roadside.\n\nThe WAL-E devices, paired with powerful cloud-based analytics, promise to identify and track every vehicle with performance metrics that meet or exceed existing systems. This innovation applies to various tolling applications, including multi-lane and vehicle classification, express lane management, and disaster recovery, creating a modernized and user-friendly tolling experience.\n\nBlissway is tagged in categories such as hardware, machine learning, SaaS, IoT, and transportation, reflecting its multidisciplinary approach to tackling long-standing industry challenges.\n\nIf you're part of an agency facing hurdles in tolling, Blissway is eager to connect and explore solutions. You can reach them at hello@blissway.com.\n\nFor more information, visit their website: [Blissway](https://www.blissway.com/).",
