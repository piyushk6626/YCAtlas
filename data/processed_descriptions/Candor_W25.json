Our AI software auto-drafts proposals and ensures full compliance.\r\n\nWhen we met at Stanford 4 years ago, it was rare for startups to work with the US Government. In the years that we\u2019ve been involved in the burgeoning Defense Tech ecosystem, a lot has changed. Silicon Valley and the US Government are closer than they\u2019ve been in decades.  \r\n\nAs fellows in Stanford\u2019s Center for National Security Innovation, we\u2019ve had the privilege of speaking with dozens of government officials who have come to Silicon Valley looking to fund and scale startups solving their most urgent problems. \r\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve seen firsthand the struggles these startups face in securing gov funding. Marcus, having spoken with dozens of defense startups in his time helping lead the Stanford Defense Tech Club and trying to set up a national security startup accelerator has seen this especially.\r\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re making it easier to find and apply for opportunities, taking the application process from weeks to days.\r\n\nWe\u2019re only going to see more cooperation in the coming years. With that, there will be increasingly more funding going towards companies in defense, energy, biotech, quantum, etc. Candor lets you unlock that funding potential.",
