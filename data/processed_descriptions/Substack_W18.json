    "generated_description": "**Substack: The Platform for Independent Voices**\n\nFounded in 2017 and hailing from the Y Combinator Batch W18, Substack has emerged as a haven for independent writers. Based in San Francisco and sporting a dedicated team of 90, Substack is on a mission: to facilitate independent writing and enable authors to cultivate their own communities.\n\nThe premise? Simple. You can start a newsletter for free, build your audience, and monetize through subscriptions. The innovative twist is that while publishing is entirely free, Substack takes a cut only when you start making money, ensuring that the platform\u2019s success aligns with the creator\u2019s.\n\n### What They Do\n\nSubstack acts as a marketplace where writers can share their thoughts on countless topics\u2014from politics and business to art and culture. It\u2019s about giving control back to the writers, where they own their content, mailing lists, and subscriber payments. This model hands the reins back to the creators, allowing them to connect directly with their audience without gatekeepers stifling their voices.\n\n### Noteworthy Features\n\n- **Editorial Freedom**: Full ownership of content without interference.\n- **Revenue Sharing**: You earn, Substack earns.\n- **Unrestricted Publishing**: No limits on creativity and expression.\n\nSubstack\u2019s ethos invites creativity and builds communities, making it not just a platform, but a movement for the independent voice in a crowded digital landscape. You create, you connect, and ultimately, you create value for both yourself and your subscribers.\n\nIf you're curious to dive deeper or perhaps start your own newsletter, head over to their [website](https://substack.com).",
