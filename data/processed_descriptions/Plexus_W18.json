    "generated_description": "Plexus is a London-based startup that\u2019s setting its sights on enriching the virtual and augmented reality experience with high-performance gloves. Founded during the Y Combinator Batch W18, this innovative company is focused on developing gloves that enhance user interaction in VR and AR environments\u2014think of them as the missing link to make virtual experiences feel as tangible as real life.\n\nCurrently, Plexus operates with a small team of three, a tight-knit group crucial for a startup in its early stages. While the website and some specifics may still be under wraps, you can find them at http://plexus.im. Their focus on high-performance gloves shows promise, suggesting that they are not only in the exploratory phase but are also gearing up to make a significant impact in the AR space.\n\nDespite lacking detailed information about their current projects or partners, the potential is clear. By targeting the niche of haptic feedback in augmented and virtual realities, Plexus aims to elevate how users interact with digital environments. It\u2019s a bold move that reflects a broader trend towards more immersive tech. Keep an eye on them; innovation often comes from the least expected corners, and Plexus might just be one of those corners.",
