    "generated_description": "**Company Overview: R2**\n\nFounded in 2020 and based in Mexico City, R2 is on a mission to provide embedded lending infrastructure that empowers platforms to seamlessly offer financing to their small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers, especially across Latin America. The company has quickly positioned itself as a key player in the fintech and B2B landscape, being a product of the Y Combinator Batch W21 and backed by notable firms including Gradient Ventures and General Catalyst.\n\n**What R2 Does**\n\nR2\u2019s core offering is simple yet powerful: it allows platforms to become capital providers for their merchants through an API-first approach. By integrating R2 into their systems, platforms can provide revenue-based financing\u2014allowing merchants to access funds ranging from $500 to $50,000. This service not only boosts merchant engagement and retention but also opens up new revenue streams for the platforms themselves.\n\nKey features of R2's offering include:\n- **Seamless API Integration**: Platforms can easily integrate R2\u2019s services into their own infrastructure.\n- **Advanced Scoring Models**: R2 leverages data from millions of merchants to offer personalized financing options.\n- **Same-Day Capital Access**: Merchants can receive funding quickly and efficiently.\n- **All-in-One Service**: R2 manages the lending experience entirely, including credit risk, KYC, and collections.\n\n**Team & Culture**\n\nR2's team consists of about 50 employees driven by innovation and dedication to improving access to capital for SMBs in a region often underserved by traditional financial institutions. With Brad Flora serving as Group Partner, the company benefits from strong leadership and a clear vision on growth and impact.\n\n**The Bigger Picture**\n\nIn a landscape where access to finance can be a bottleneck for growth, R2 is positioning itself strategically to eliminate friction and enhance the capital flow for growing businesses. The company's embedded lending solutions not only support platforms\u2014they create a cycle of trust that cultivates a thriving ecosystem for both businesses and consumers.\n\nIf you're a platform looking to enhance your service offerings and support your merchants better, R2 could be your next strategic partner.
