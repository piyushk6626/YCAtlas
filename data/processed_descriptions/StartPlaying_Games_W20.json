Originally called \"Hello!\", the platform quickly established itself as the largest marketplace for players seeking professional game masters for tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and Pathfinder.\n\nThe mission of StartPlaying is straightforward: **Building Communities Through Play**. With over **40 million D&D players** globally and a notable steady increase in sales for five years running, the demand for organized, engaging gaming experiences continues to grow.

The platform allows users to browse hundreds of tabletop RPG systems and find games that suit their style (combat, roleplaying, puzzles\u2014you name it). Players unfamiliar with the genre can also find experienced Dungeon Masters ready to guide them into the action.\n\nPricing is determined by the individual game masters, making access to various game types flexible and tailored. Additionally, StartPlaying enables players to join existing games solo if they lack a group, facilitating connections among fans.\n\nBeyond casual play, StartPlaying caters to corporations seeking engaging team-building exercises.
