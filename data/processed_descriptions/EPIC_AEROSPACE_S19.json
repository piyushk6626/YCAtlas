    "generated_description": "### EPIC AEROSPACE: A New Frontier in Satellite Delivery\n\n**Mission**: EPIC AEROSPACE is all about \"last-mile delivery\" for satellites. They want to revolutionize how we transport and deploy satellites in space, making it easier to move to the right orbit.\n\n**Background**: This company, which started in Y Combinator's S19 batch, is rooted in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and boasts a dynamic team of 14. Although the exact founding date is unclear, their ambitions are crystal clear.\n\n**Core Focus**: Tagged under *commercial-space-launch*, *hard-tech*, and *space-exploration*, EPIC AEROSPACE aims to build a robust network of space tugs, or Orbit Transfer Vehicles (OTVs), that will handle everything from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and beyond. This infrastructure will enable satellites to move freely in inner space, unlocking a range of new functionalities.\n\n**Recent Achievements**: They\u2019ve already made significant strides with their first vehicle\u2014the CHIMERA LEO 1. This space-tug made its debut during the SpaceX Transporter 6 Mission, showcasing their capabilities in orbit transfer. You can catch the highlights of this launch [here](http://epic-aerospace.com/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQaBL5CHMrI>).\n\n**Services Offered**: EPIC AEROSPACE doesn\u2019t just stop at launching satellites; they provide end-to-end support that includes satellite design and operational oversight. This means they are building not just devices, but the entire ecosystem necessary for navigating and managing satellites in space.\n\n**Vision**: The ultimate goal? A new generation of satellites that are upgradeable and more powerful, creating a mobility infrastructure that could change the way we think about space operations.\n\n**Connect with Them**: Interested in learning more? Check out their [website](http://epic-aerospace.com) for a deep dive into their mission, capabilities, and latest news. You can also follow them on [Twitter](http://epic-aerospace.com/<https:/twitter.com/epicaerospace>), [YouTube](http://epic-aerospace.com/<https:/www.youtube.com/channel/UC7A_4ROQ0QngOgEW7SK7jhg>), [Instagram](http://epic-aerospace.com/<https:/www.instagram.com/epicaerospace/>), and [LinkedIn](http://epic-aerospace.com/<https:/www.linkedin.com/company/epic-aerospace/>).\n\nIn a world where space is the final frontier, EPIC AEROSPACE is building the infrastructure that could redefine access and mobility in orbit. Keep an eye on them; their journey in the cosmos is just beginning.",
