    "generated_description": "**Origami Agents: Your New Go-To for Finding Perfect Customers**\n\nFounded in 2024 and currently a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch F24, Origami Agents is on a mission to reshape how businesses connect with their ideal customers. The founders, Finn Mallery and Kenson Chung, aren\u2019t just any entrepreneurs; they come with rich backgrounds from the startup ecosystem, with Finn having built custom outbound solutions for over 20 startups and Kenson serving as the CTO at an enterprise sales startup. They realized they were developing a solution for clients repeatedly, a tool that outshone traditional outbound methods tenfold.\n\nSo, what exactly do Origami Agents do? They deploy a massive army of digital agents that act like dedicated sales reps. These agents comb through the vast expanse of the web\u2014analyzing websites, press releases, and product pages\u2014to identify the top 1% of potential customers for each business every single day. But it doesn\u2019t stop there; they help make sense of the remaining 99% of unstructured data, providing insights that a human rep simply couldn\u2019t manage alone.\n\n**How it Works:** Origami Agents leverage sophisticated scraping technologies to understand customer behavior and industry trends. Imagine having an intelligence that not only finds leads but also provides context and relevance for outreach. For example, agents can sift through job postings to identify companies hiring for specific roles or track customer sentiment through reviews. They read through complex websites and glean actionable insights, narrowing down prospects who truly need your solution.\n\nFrom leveraging LinkedIn updates to evaluating business reviews, Origami Agents continuously adapt and get smarter with every interaction. They give companies the ability to engage with their perfect customers at the right moment, ensuring that no lead goes unturned.\n\n**Meet the Team:** \n- **Finn Mallery**, co-founder, studied AI at Stanford and has extensive experience in outbound strategies. \n- **Kenson Chung** brings a wealth of engineering and sales expertise from his past role in a major SaaS company.\n\nWith just two employees currently operating out of \u201cnan\u201d (a placeholder for location, perhaps hinting at the digital nature of their business), they aim to maximize outreach efficiently and effectively.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to supercharge your sales efforts and cut through the noise in customer acquisition, Origami Agents might just be the perfect solution. Their approach is straightforward yet revolutionary, making it more attainable than ever for businesses of all sizes to find their ideal clients.\n\n**Ready to dive in?** Check out [Origami Agents](https://www.origami-agents.com) and see how your sales process can transform with a team of AI agents on your side.",
