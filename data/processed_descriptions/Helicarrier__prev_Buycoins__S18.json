    "generated_description": "**Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins)**\n\nFounded in 2017 and hailing from Lagos, Nigeria, Helicarrier is on a mission to enhance cryptocurrency infrastructure across Africa. As part of Y Combinator\u2019s Batch S18, the company is positioned to tackle the unique financial challenges faced by Africans\u2014particularly those in the diaspora.\n\n### Mission\nHelicarrier aims to reconnect Africa with the global economy through better financial services. They recognize the limitations of traditional financial systems, where money often loses value quickly and serves poorly as a medium of exchange. They believe that adopting digital currencies is the way forward in creating a more open financial system.\n\n### Key Offerings\n1. **Sendcash**: This app enables users to send money from anywhere in the world to Africa in under five minutes, leveraging cryptocurrency for speedy remittance.\n   \n2. **Desk**: A more personalized service for businesses and high-net-worth individuals, Desk provides cross-border payment solutions and crypto trading with a focus on large liquidity transactions at competitive rates.\n   \n3. **Accrue**: Designed for ease of use in fund transfers across Africa, Accrue allows users to create virtual USD cards, receive money quickly, and even earn up to 4.5% annual interest on their savings.\n\n### Team & Collaboration\nWith a dedicated team of around 30 employees and support from partners like Nan, Helicarrier is firmly rooted in its local context while striving for continental impact in the crypto arena.\n\n### Recent Developments\nRecently, Helicarrier has announced the acquisition of significant equity in Accrue, transitioning its original service, Buycoins Basic, into this new, enhanced offering.\n\n### Why It Matters\nFor too long, financial services in Africa have lagged behind the advancements made in communication and technology. Helicarrier\u2019s vision is to bridge this gap, ensuring that the continent is not left behind as the world embraces digital currencies. \n\nIn summary, Helicarrier is more than just a cryptocurrency platform; it\u2019s a beacon of hope for transforming financial services in Africa, fostering economic connectivity and empowering users with tools for better financial management.
