    "generated_description": "**Seabound** is a pioneering company based in London, founded in 2021 as part of Y Combinator\u2019s Batch W22. Their mission is straightforward yet ambitious: to equip ships with the technology to capture carbon emissions effectively. This is crucial in an era where the shipping industry faces increasing pressure to meet new global emissions regulations. \n\n### The Problem\nShipping contributes significantly to global CO2 emissions, yet shipowners have been limited in their options for compliance and sustainability. Future fuels are still a long way off, and traditional efficiency measures just aren\u2019t cutting it. \n\n### The Solution\nEnter Seabound's retrofittable carbon capture system, which can help vessels reduce CO2 emissions by up to 95%. Their effective design allows for quick installation at minimal capital expenditure (CAPEX), capturing between 25-95% of emissions by converting CO2 into solid, easy-to-store carbonate pebbles. They also provide a streamlined operation: capturing, offloading, and recycling these pebbles at key ports. Simply put, Seabound offers shipowners a proven technology that addresses a pressing challenge today.\n\n### Team & Partners\nSeabound is led by co-founder and CEO Alisha Fredriksson, who brings significant experience from her work with maritime startups and climate initiatives. The team consists of nine individuals, including experts in engineering and research, crucial for innovating their carbon capture technology. Their strategic partnerships with firms like Lowercarbon Capital and Eastern Pacific Shipping bolster their credibility and outreach.\n\n### Why It Matters\nThe stakes are high; shipping drives 90% of the world\u2019s economy. By adopting Seabound\u2019s technology, shipowners can not only comply with upcoming regulations but also position themselves as leaders in the decarbonization of their industry. \n\n### The Takeaway\nSeabound isn\u2019t just a tech company; it's a response to a crucial need in climate action and oceanic sustainability. They're offering a tangible way for the shipping sector to take charge of its carbon output while rethinking its environmental impact. If you're interested in learning more or looking to get involved, check out their website at [seabound.co](http://seabound.co) or reach out directly via their contact page.\n\nIn a world hungry for solutions, Seabound is charting a path for innovation in maritime carbon capture. Let's just say they\u2019re not waiting for the future\u2014they\u2019re building it now.",
