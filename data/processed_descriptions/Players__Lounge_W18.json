Imagine this: instead of merely competing with friends or random opponents, you can put your skills on the line in games like Madden, NBA 2K, FIFA, Call of Duty, and Fortnite, for real cash prizes. In their mission to give gamers a financial return on their gaming time, Players' Lounge adds an exhilarating layer of entertainment.\n\nWith a robust funding of $15 million, backed by reputable investors like Y Combinator, Samsung, Griffin Gaming Partners, and even star figures like Drake and NFL player Myles Garrett, this venture is poised for growth in the gaming industry.\n\nOperating out of New York with a small, dedicated team of just 13 employees, Players' Lounge is not just about skill; it's about community. The platform allows players of all levels to engage in solo bets, head-to-head matches, and tournaments, making it inclusive for everyone from casual players to pro gamers.\n\nSo how does it work? Users can log in, select challenges, or join matches against others or even the house itself. They play normally, and upon winning, they get paid the same day. Having paid out a staggering $200 million to over a million players, the platform has established itself as a trustworthy option for gaming wagers.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Website:** [playerslounge.co](https://playerslounge.co)\n- **Founded:** 2014\n- **Funding:** $15 million from investors including Drake and Y Combinator.\n- **Company Size:** 13 employees\n- **Key Offering:** Cash prizes for playing popular AAA titles, head-to-head matches, solo betting, and tournaments.\n\nPlayers' Lounge is not just changing how we think about gaming; it's creating opportunities for players to monetize their skills while doing something they love. In a world where gaming is often seen as just a pastime, Players' Lounge asserts it can be a path to earning real money\u2014because if you can bet on a game, why not bet on yourself?",
