    "description": "If it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad enough that smokers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize the scientific facts about nicotine, most non-tobacco nicotine products are poorly designed and unappealing to use. The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.\r\n\nTherefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t carry around the sensation that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to encourage nicotine use among people who haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.\r\n\nSo, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.\r\n\nOur first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and reduce its costs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 through a superior pure nicotine product.",
