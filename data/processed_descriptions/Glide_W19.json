In ten years, we want the majority of apps worldwide to have been built with Glide.\r\n\nWe're four technical founders with expertise in native mobile frameworks, developer tools, and product design. We've worked together for 5-10 years, and were all early employees at Xamarin, a mobile developer tools startup acquired by Microsoft in 2016.",
