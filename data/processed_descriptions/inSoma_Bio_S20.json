As part of Y Combinator\u2019s Batch S20, this small but impactful team of four is dedicated to transforming the landscape of reconstructive surgery. Their mission? To help plastic surgeons effectively rebuild fat, leveraging innovative solutions inspired by nature.\n\n### What They Do\n\nAt the heart of inSoma Bio's offerings is their unique **Fractomer Biomatrix**, a bio-inspired product designed to enhance reconstructive plastic surgery. This technology enables surgeons to utilize a patient\u2019s own tissue instead of relying on synthetic implants or fillers. This approach not only preserves the natural anatomical structures but also minimizes risks associated with foreign materials. \n\nSome key features of their technology include:\n- **Bio-inspired Design**: Fractomers are derived from protein sequences found in the human body, ensuring compatibility.\n- **Tissue Support**: These products provide necessary support and shape for co-injected cells or tissues, promoting biointegration.\n- **Thermal Activation**: A built-in thermal switch activates their materials only at body temperature, enhancing safety and efficacy.\n- **Recombinant Production**: Created at the genetic level, allowing for production without the need to harvest natural tissues.\n\n### The Team\n\nThe team behind inSoma Bio is led by Dr. **Stefan Roberts**, who brings nearly a decade of experience in biomaterials design, which he developed as part of his dissertation at Duke University. He is joined by noted figures such as Dr. **Ashutosh Chilkoti**, a seasoned founder and chair of the Biomedical Engineering Department at Duke, and Dr. **Scott Hollenbeck**, a leading plastic surgeon at the University of Virginia who shapes the company's medical advisory direction.\n\n### Noteworthy Partnerships\n\nThe company has gained the trust of respected institutions and partnerships, enhancing its credibility and reach in the medical device sector. \n\n### Conclusion\n\ninSoma Bio is not just another player in the med-tech space; they are redefining reconstructive surgery with a thoughtful blend of synthetic biology and medical devices. With a strong foundation and a vision that prioritizes patient safety and natural integration, they are poised to make significant strides in their field.
