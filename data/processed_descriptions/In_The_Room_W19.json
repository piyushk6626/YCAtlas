Currently, I'm focused on building In The Room.\n\nI started my tech journey in 2010, teaching myself to code while creating a mobile on-demand music platform that gained 500,000 users in just a few months (pre-Spotify). Later, I co-founded a two-person AI startup, scaling it to a projected $36M in revenue within 42 months before exiting.",

With a mission to foster real-time connections in physical spaces, ITR is designed as a hyper-local geospatial social network that helps people connect with others literally in the same room. Imagine walking into a bar, a conference, or any public gathering and asking, \u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d\u2014ITR has your back.\n\nThe platform currently focuses on three key areas: dating, friendships, and professional networking. It\u2019s perfect for making connections wherever you are: at a restaurant, club, lounge, or even at an event in a spot like Miami Beach. The idea is simple, yet powerful: go outside, enjoy the vibe, and connect with others nearby.\n\nFounded as part of Y Combinator's Batch W19, ITR embodies the belief that life is richer in person rather than behind a screen. With just one team member at the moment, the company carries the tag of being in the realms of artificial intelligence, dating, social networking, and location-based services. They are committed to turning virtual interactions into meaningful in-person relationships.\n\nThe company's website, [intheroom.social](https://www.intheroom.social), offers users a gateway to explore who\u2019s around them and what\u2019s happening in real-time, encouraging a lifestyle that embraces spontaneity and authentic connections.\n\nIn summary, In The Room taps into the essence of human interaction, transforming ordinary spaces into opportunities for connection. The future looks bright for this innovative app as it paves the way toward more engaging and fulfilling social experiences.",
