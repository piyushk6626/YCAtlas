    "generated_description": "SOMATIC is a cutting-edge robotics company founded in 2018, and it\u2019s part of the Y Combinator W20 batch, which gives it a noteworthy pedigree in the startup world. Their mission? To revolutionize the cleanliness of commercial bathrooms using autonomous bathroom cleaning robots. Based in [N/A], SOMATIC employs a team of 31 talented individuals who are dedicated to this innovative task.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about what these robots actually do. The SOMATIC cleaning robots are equipped with advanced technology that allows them to autonomously spray cleaning solutions, vacuum up debris with a built-in wetvac, and even handle the rather mundane task of opening doors. The result is a consistent and high-quality cleaning solution, particularly beneficial for high-traffic areas that demand meticulous upkeep. \n\nThe value proposition is striking: a cleaner, healthier environment for users and a significant reduction in labor costs. SOMATIC suggests that their technology can lead to up to 50% in cost savings and helps reduce staff turnover by providing a steady, reliable workforce for cleaning teams. \n\nIn terms of practicality, they offer a simple pricing structure that scales based on service hours, from $1,500 for 8 hours on weekdays to $4,500 for 16 hours every day. Notably, there's no upfront fee, making it easier for businesses to incorporate this technology quickly.\n\nIt appears SOMATIC is addressing a real need in the cleaning industry while leveraging the latest robotics to raise the bar for hygiene in public facilities. With their commitment to efficiency and quality, they could redefine how we think about commercial cleaning. For more information, visit their website at [getsomatic.com](http://getsomatic.com).",
