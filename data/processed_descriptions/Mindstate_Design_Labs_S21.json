    "generated_description": "**Mindstate Design Labs** is a forward-thinking company focused on revolutionizing mental health treatments through next-generation psychedelic therapeutics. Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's S21 batch, the company is based in San Francisco and operates with a small but dedicated team of seven employees.\n\n### Mission & Vision\nThe core mission of Mindstate Design Labs is to develop novel altered states of consciousness that can address various mental health issues. They leverage cutting-edge technology, specifically machine learning, along with human experiential data and molecular pharmacology, to design these groundbreaking therapeutic interventions. \n\n### Innovative Approach\nAt the center of their innovation is a platform called **Osmanthus**, which uses natural history and biochemical data to create predictive models for designing altered states of consciousness with therapeutic potential. This approach addresses a significant challenge in psychedelic drug development: the lack of a reliable means to distinguish between different altered states. Mindstate aims to fill this gap, enabling precision in designing modified conscious states for therapeutic use.\n\n### Team & Expertise\nThe co-founders, **Dillan DiNardo** and **Thomas Ray, PhD**, are backed by a diverse team of experts. DiNardo has a strong background in biotechnology and venture capital, while Ray brings extensive knowledge from his work in evolutionary biology and the natural history study of psychedelic experiences. Their leadership team includes professionals with vast experience in drug discovery, clinical development, and regulatory affairs, ensuring a robust framework for the company\u2019s research and development efforts.\n\n### Pipeline & Future Potential\nMindstate's pipeline includes using psychedelic \"primers\" and non-psychedelic \"probes\" to modulate therapeutic effects. They've already identified six unique probe candidates that show promise when combined with their lead primer compounds. This research has the potential to yield entirely new classes of therapies for mental health.\n\n### Community & Impact\nAs pioneers in the psychedelics space, Mindstate Design Labs is positioning itself at the forefront of a burgeoning field that aligns well with modern mental health needs. With increasing recognition in the media and a growing base of research backing their initiatives, they aim to impact the way mental health treatments are perceived and delivered.\n\n### Learn More\nFor more details on their exciting work and developments, visit [Mindstate Design Labs](http://mindstate.design). As they continue to evolve, they are always on the lookout for exceptional talent to join their innovative journey. This is a company that not only embraces technology but also seeks to drive significant human progress in mental health through psychedelic research.",
