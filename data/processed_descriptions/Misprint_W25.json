    "description": "Misprint is an all-in-one marketplace that solves the biggest pain point in the collectibles world: opaque pricing. Collectors, investors, and hobbyists currently rely on scattered data from auction houses, online forums, and reseller platforms, making it difficult to know the true value of their items. Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\r\n\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint\u2019s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\r\n\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\r\n\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\r\n\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor. By merging Goldman Sachs-level financial analytics with top-tier mathematical talent, Misprint is uniquely positioned to become the go-to platform for fair, transparent pricing in the collectibles space.",

Co-founders Eva and Jon, long-time friends with backgrounds in finance and mathematics, recognized a significant gap in the collectibles market: the lack of reliable and accessible price information. \n\n**The Mission**\n\nAt its core, Misprint aims to demystify the pricing of collectibles. Collectors and investors have traditionally relied on fragmented data\u2014auction results, online forums, and inconsistent reseller platforms\u2014that often leads to uncertainty about the true value of their items. Misprint consolidates this data into a seamless buying and selling experience, underpinned by robust pricing analytics and machine learning models.\n\n**The Problem and the Solution**\n\nCurrent marketplaces often lack the real-time analytics collectors need, primarily due to the complex nature of valuation that's both domain-specific and algorithmically driven. Misprint's solution combines the insider knowledge of trading cards with sophisticated machine learning methods to offer real-time, transparent pricing. As we\u2019ve seen with the recent trading card market surges, collectors have a strong desire for transparent and accurate valuations.\n\n**Market Potential**\n\nThe collectibles market is massive, estimated to be worth tens of billions. Eva's experience speaks to this potential: she generated $500k in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by scaling her Pok\u00e9mon card-selling side hustle. With Misprint's focus on other segments like sports cards and comics, the pathway to growth appears not only promising but exciting.\n\n**Team and Expertise**\n\nDespite its small size\u2014currently just two core team members\u2014Misprint leverages exceptional talent with backgrounds at Goldman Sachs and advanced mathematical expertise. Aaron Epstein, serving as Group Partner, adds further credibility and direction to the team.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- **Marketplace for Graded Cards**: A dedicated platform for buying and selling graded collectibles that adjusts offers based on community-driven pricing.\n- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilizing machine learning to provide accurate pricing guidance.\n- **Broad Range of Collectibles**: Currently focused on Pok\u00e9mon cards, with plans to expand into more collectible categories, hinting at a diverse product offering.\n\nIn sum, Misprint is tackling a common pain point for collectors: pricing transparency.
