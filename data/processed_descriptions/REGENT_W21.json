    "description": "REGENT is building a new mode of transportation that will redefine regional mobility by mid-decade. Their first product, the seaglider, is an all-electric, hydrofoiling boat-plane that operates within a wingspan of the water's surface.  By flying low on a cushion of air, seagliders unlock the ability to fly twice as far as an electric aircraft, while being regulated by maritime authorities enabling market entry for a fraction of the cost.\r\n\nREGENT has de-risked seaglider technology with a \u00bc-scale, 400 lb, flying demonstration vehicle and a full-scale wing test section. By 2024, REGENT will fly humans on the first full-scale prototype seaglider.  By mid-decade, REGENT\u2019s customers - airlines and ferry companies \u2013 will begin commercial seaglider service on the 12-seat initial product.\r\n\nIn just two years, REGENT has accumulated $8B in provisional orders (including firm deposits) proving the potential of the $25B+ initial market. \r\n\nREGENT, a team of 40, is led by MIT-trained, ex-Boeing engineers Billy Thalheimer and Mike Klinker.  REGENT has raised $50M to date from the likes of Thiel Capital, Founders Fund, Mark Cuban, Y Combinator, and includes strategic investment from Japan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Mesa Airlines.",

This allows it to fly twice as far as traditional electric aircraft, while benefiting from maritime regulations that significantly cut down the costs of market entry. The seaglider can cruise at speeds of 180 mph (290 kph) over distances of up to 180 miles (290 km).\n\n**Development Progress:**\nREGENT has de-risked its technology through a \u00bc-scale flying demonstration vehicle and a full-scale wing test. A full-scale prototype that carries human passengers is anticipated to take flight in 2024. By mid-decade, commercial seaglider operations are expected to begin, initially featuring a 12-seat configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nThis innovative approach addresses critical pain points in regional travel\u2014cost, speed, and emissions. The electric powertrain allows for lower operating costs and zero emissions. Plus, with no airport security hassles and swift travel speeds, the seaglider promises faster door-to-door times compared to traditional air and ferry travel.\n\nWith a strong footing in both the aerospace and maritime sectors, REGENT is positioned to redefine how we think about regional transport over the coming years.\n\n**Current Engagements:**\nThe team is actively developing and testing their technology while engaging with major airlines and ferry operators to secure partnerships for future commercial services.\n\nFor more details on REGENT and its vision for the future of travel, check their website: [REGENT](http://regentcraft.com).",
