Examples include 'pause' (when talking too much), 'set next steps' (when wrapping up a call without them), and 'ask current state' (when encountering objections).\r\n\nTrellus is backed by Y Combinator and founded by former MIT researchers.",

    "generated_description": "### Trellus: Your Real-Time Sales Coach\n\nFounded in 2022 and launched through Y Combinator\u2019s W22 batch, Trellus is armed with a mission: to provide real-time coaching for Sales Development Representatives (SDRs). This New York-based startup is on a mission to elevate the sales game by empowering reps with immediate, actionable coaching prompts during their conversations with prospects.\n\n#### The Problem\n\nSales is a tough game, and hitting quotas can feel like running a marathon without a plan. Many salespeople struggle to engage effectively during calls, where missteps can mean the difference between closing a deal or losing a prospect. That's where Trellus enters the picture.\n\n#### The Solution\n\nTrellus delivers simple yet effective coaching prompts exactly when they\u2019re needed\u2014while sales conversations are happening. Imagine being in the moment and getting nudges like \u201cpause\u201d when you're dominating the conversation or \u201cset next steps\u201d when wrapping up a call. These are not generic tips; they are tailored responses to real-time interactions. The goal? To help more salespeople meet or exceed their quotas faster and with less ramp-up time.\n\n#### The Tech Behind Trellus\n\nTrellus is built by former MIT researchers and leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the learning experience for sales teams. Not just about whispers in their ears, the platform offers analytical tools to track performance and improve skills over time. The tools include:\n\n- **AI Coach**: Provides live feedback on handling objections and competitor positioning.\n- **Parallel Dialing & Voice Agents**: Streamlines outbound calls, allowing for simultaneous dialing, and uses AI to simulate customer interactions for training.\n- **Sales Floor**: Creates a virtual space for teams to connect, share strategies, and celebrate wins collectively, making remote work feel less isolating.\n\n#### What\u2019s Next for Trellus?\n\nWith a compact team of three, Trellus is already making waves in the B2B sales sector. As they continue to refine their approach, their aim is to further reduce barriers to effective communication in sales and transform SDR training into a more dynamic, results-oriented process.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to supercharge your sales team with real-time insights driven by artificial intelligence, Trellus is worth a look. For more information, check out their website: [Trellus](https://www.trellus.ai).\n\n---\n\nAbove all, Trellus embodies the spirit of innovation in sales coaching\u2014effortlessly combining AI with empathy to create a smarter, more responsive sales force.
