    "description": "Traditional trucking companies still run on paper, emails, phone calls, and snail mail. They\u2019re inefficient and bloated. The pressure of low margins suffocates the truckers who actually do the work.\r\n\nOur software cuts out the inefficiencies, and we pass the savings through to our truckers. Instead of paper-pushers and endless phone calls, they get an end-to-end solution: customer management, load coordination, automated invoicing, and instant payments. A single place to manage their business.\r\n\nA blog post that goes deeper into why we started this company: https://medium.com/@jinstedge/truenorth-b42437f1dc03\r\n\nWe're a team of over 60, and proud to say the *majority* of us are female or non-binary. We come from a wide range of backgrounds. We don't just value diversity, we cherish it. And we mean it.",
