    "generated_description": "**Instinct** is a forward-thinking company on a mission to revolutionize lunar navigation through the development of GPS satellites tailored for the moon. Founded in 2024 and currently part of Y Combinator's Batch W25, Instinct is based in San Francisco and operates with a lean team of just four employees.\n\nWhat sets Instinct apart is its innovative approach to satellite design. By condensing existing navigation architectures into a compact cubesat format, they aim to significantly reduce both manufacturing and launch costs. This downsizing not only accelerates deployment but also enhances system resiliency\u2014a crucial factor for the unpredictable nature of space exploration.\n\nInstinct's core product is a constellation of 6U CubeSats packed with sophisticated navigation transmitters. These small but mighty satellites are built on proven smallsat technology, designed to provide precise navigation signals that support critical lunar landing operations. This means spacecraft can rely on real-time positioning data for a pinpoint landing, guiding them safely from orbit to touchdown.\n\nThe company's carefully designed elliptical orbits ensure constant coverage, with a special focus on the South Polar region of the moon\u2014an area poised to be at the heart of future lunar missions and human endeavors.\n\nIn the fast-evolving landscape of commercial space exploration, Instinct positions itself as a game changer, championing low-cost, high-precision navigation solutions that will facilitate a new era of lunar missions. If you want to learn more or have questions, you can reach out to them at founders@instinct-space.com or visit their website at [Instinct](https://www.instinct-space.com/).\n\nIn summary, Instinct is not just about satellites; it\u2019s about laying the groundwork for a sustained human presence on the moon. In a field where every gram counts and precision is paramount, they are making big strides in making lunar navigation more accessible and efficient."
