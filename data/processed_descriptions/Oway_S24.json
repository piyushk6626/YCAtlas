    "description": "Oway is a rideshare freight platform that uses machine learning to automatically coordinate and sell unused space in trucks to SMBs at a 50% discount for lightning-fast shipping. \r\n\nEvery year, nearly 50% all truck space goes unused annually in the almost $1T US trucking industry. On the other hand, SMBs represent 44% of the US GDP and are historically forced to deal with high freight rates and friction due to their small size compared to enterprise businesses. \r\n\nWith trucking being a hyper-fragmented market (90%+ of US trucking companies are small family businesses), we decided to build an ecosystem that takes all of this inefficiency and turns it into something that could fundamentally transform the livelihoods of businesses and drivers alike.\r\n\nOway is designed to be simple (you can place an order in 30 seconds) and scale with your business. Our ML rideshare protocol now allows businesses to ship freight affordably and faster than ever before. We also improve the survivability of independent truckers by maximizing their revenue when they\u2019re already on the road - and it\u2019s great for the environment too. \ud83c\udf43",

The platform is designed to make rideshare freight both fast and affordable, primarily targeting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that often struggle with high freight rates.\n\n#### The Problem & Solution\n\nThe trucking industry in the U.S. is a massive $1 trillion market, yet astonishingly, nearly **50% of truck space goes unused** every year. Meanwhile, SMBs\u2014accounting for **44% of the U.S. GDP**\u2014face disproportionate challenges due to higher freight costs compared to their larger counterparts. Oway addresses these inefficiencies by creating an ecosystem that connects carriers with available truck space and SMBs needing to ship freight. By facilitating the coordination of unused truck capacities through an intuitive platform, Oway not only benefits businesses but also increases the earnings of independent truckers.\n\n#### Features\n\n- **Lightning-Fast Order Process**: Users can place an order in just **30 seconds**.\n- **Cost-Effective Freight Shipping**: Shipments can be made at a **50% discount** compared to traditional freight rates.\n- **Rapid Pickups**: The platform enables pickups within **one hour**.\n- **Fully Automated Processes**: Oway automates paperwork, signatures, and scheduling to simplify the shipping experience. \n- **Safety and Satisfaction**: All shipments come with **$100K insurance** coverage, and Oway offers full refunds if any issues arise during shipping.\n\n#### Ecosystem Benefits\n\nOway is not merely a shipping service; it's a transformational platform designed to:\n- Enhance the **livelihoods of drivers and businesses** by increasing truck utilization.\n- Benefit the **environment** by reducing unnecessary road usage.\n- Create a seamless experience for SMBs by eliminating friction in freight processes.\n\n#### Growth Prospects\n\nWith a scalable model tailored for rapid adoption, Oway is poised to tap into the hyper-fragmented U.S. trucking market, where over **90% of trucking companies are lesser-known family-owned businesses**. Their efficient use of machine learning not only enhances operational capabilities but offers sustainability by addressing the surplus capacity in freight logistics.\n\n---\n\nIn a nutshell, Oway is pushing the boundaries of the freight industry by making shipping faster, cheaper, and smarter, ultimately driving down costs and maximizing utility\u2014for both carriers and clients alike.
