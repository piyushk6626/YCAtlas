Despite distribution being a multi-trillion dollar industry, the legacy ERP systems that exist to help businesses manage their purchasing, inventory, sales, order processing, and accounting are decades behind. \r\n\nFor the most part, ERP systems are painfully slow, difficult to use, and soul-crushingly manual. Using Recurrency can boost a distributor\u2019s revenue and profit margins, while reducing waste and saving time. Most importantly, Recurrency is fully integrated with the customer\u2019s legacy system, so deploying Recurrency in production can be done in as little as one day.",
