The company has a clear mission: to provide curated, evidence-based answers to clinical questions, making it easier for healthcare professionals to get critical information quickly. Typically, hospitals employ clinical pharmacists to field these questions, but InpharmD offers a more efficient outsourced solution.\n\nThe platform allows clinical pharmacists to pose any clinical question at any time and receive tailored literature searches and responses, greatly reducing the time spent on research\u2014which can often take hours. In fact, InpharmD has already saved over 94,000 clinical pharmacist hours.\n\nWith a small but impactful team of 16 employees, InpharmD is leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance the speed and accuracy of medical literature searches. To date, they are trusted by more than 20,000 healthcare providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists.\n\nThe company\u2019s technology is particularly relevant in the fields of telemedicine and B2B services, as it addresses the urgent need for rapid access to reliable clinical information. \n\nLed by Jared Friedman as Group Partner, InpharmD simplifies the research process, allowing healthcare practitioners to focus more on patient care rather than getting lost in journals and paywalls. As a burgeoning tool in the medical community, it stands out for its commitment to improving the workflow of clinical professionals.\n\nInpharmD embodies the transformation we often discuss in healthcare\u2014a shift that prioritizes actionable advice over sifting through endless documents.
