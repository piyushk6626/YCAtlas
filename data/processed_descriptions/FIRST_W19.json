I originally got into YC for a business called Habitat Logistics, where we delivered orders from Grubhub, Uber, and DoorDash. \u2028In having to build our own software, we realized that\u2026everyone is having to build their own software. Before starting Habitat and now FIRST, I graduated from Temple University in Philadelphia and graduated with a degree in economics. I'm particularly fascinated by behavioral economics. I also enjoy playing tennis and skiing.",
