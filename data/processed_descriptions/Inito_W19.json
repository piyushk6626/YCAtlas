Their mission centers on improving self-care through innovative technology that simplifies fertility management. With a dedicated team of around 100 employees and the backing of Y Combinator\u2019s W19 batch, Inito is carving out a niche in the burgeoning fertility-tech and health-tech sectors.\n\n#### What Makes Inito Unique?\n\nAt its core, Inito operates as an all-in-one fertility monitor, measuring four crucial hormones\u2014Estrogen, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Progesterone (as PdG), and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)\u2014all on a single test strip. Unlike conventional ovulation tests that typically provide binary \u201cyes/no\u201d results based merely on LH spikes, Inito gives detailed insights into hormone levels, helping women pinpoint their most fertile windows.\n\nIn just **10 minutes**, users can dip a test strip in urine, attach it to their smartphone (currently compatible with iPhone 7 and later), and receive personalized, actionable data. This data not only aids in predicting ovulation but also in confirming it, giving users a clearer picture of their fertility cycles. \n\n#### Why Choose Inito?\n\n- **Comprehensive Hormone Tracking:** Inito is the only fertility monitor that tracks all four hormones simultaneously, providing a more nuanced understanding of menstrual cycles.\n- **User-Friendly App:** The accompanying app simplifies the tracking process, sending notifications about test days, results, and confirmed ovulation.\n- **Trusted by Couples:** With over 20,000 couples relying on Inito, testimonials highlight successful pregnancies facilitated by accurate hormone monitoring.\n\n#### Key Features:\n\n- **Real-Time Data**: Offers numerical values for hormone levels instead of generic readings, essential for those with irregular cycles.\n- **Effective Confirmation**: Helps confirm ovulation through sustained PdG levels, which are critical for successful conception.\n- **HSA/FSA Eligible**: This makes it easier for users in the U.S. to afford fertility testing.\n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions:\n\n- **What results does Inito provide?**\n  Inito delivers results such as High Fertility, Peak Fertility, and Ovulation Confirmed, along with charts of hormone levels.\n  \n- **How many test strips are needed per cycle?**\n  This varies; an average cycle might require 12-15 tests. \n\n- **Can I use HSA benefits?**\n  Yes, Inito is eligible for HSA purchases.\n\n- **Is it FDA approved?**\n  It\u2019s registered as a Class I medical device in the U.S., exempt from many premarket requirements, though it has not been explicitly cleared or approved.\n\nInito is more than just a product; it\u2019s a tool that empowers women to understand their bodies better and enhance their chances of conception. Whether you\u2019re actively trying to conceive or simply wanting to keep track of your hormonal health, Inito provides an insightful, data-driven approach to fertility monitoring.\n\nFor anyone interested in leveraging technology for better reproductive health, Inito is certainly worth considering.
