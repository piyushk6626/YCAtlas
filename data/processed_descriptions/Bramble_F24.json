It helps agents auto-generate beautiful video listings and helps buyers search them for what they actually care about, like natural light or a big yard.\r\n\nWe launched as a flat-rate real estate brokerage. After helping customers close on $10M worth of homes, we learned that lead generation is the biggest problem in real estate. By helping agents market their listings with videos and allowing buyers to find homes visually, we'll build a next-generation Zillow.",

    "generated_description": "Bramble is embarking on a mission to redefine the real estate market as \"the next generation Zillow.\" Founded in 2024 and nestled in San Francisco, Bramble started as a video-first search platform anchored in AI technology. This innovative approach allows real estate agents to automatically create stunning video listings, making the property search not just easier but more visually engaging.\n\nWhat sets Bramble apart is its understanding of the buyer's desires\u2014rather than sifting through lists of properties based on basic filters, users can search for what truly matters to them, like \"lots of natural light\" or \"big yards.\" This tailored approach is rooted in Bramble\u2019s experience, having successfully closed $10 million in real estate transactions as a flat-rate brokerage before pivoting to focus on lead generation challenges, which they found to be the crux of real estate hurdles.\n\nWith a compact team of three and backing from Y Combinator Batch F24, Bramble is primed for growth. Their technology not only enhances the visibility of listings through visually appealing videos but also helps buyers find homes that fit their lifestyle preferences, bridging a gap between buyers and agents with a personalized touch. \n\nIf you're curious to know more or want to see how it works, you can explore their platform at [usebramble.com](https://usebramble.com).\n\nIn summary, Bramble is not just another real estate platform; it\u2019s leveraging AI to create a more intuitive, visually compelling home-buying experience, aiming to reshape how we search for our next favorite space.",
