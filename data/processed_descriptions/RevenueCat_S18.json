I moved to Silicon Valley to work at a startup called Elevate, which was awarded Apple's App of the Year in 2014. At Elevate, I met my co-founder Jacob and we learned first hand how challenging it is to implement in-app subscriptions. We decided to start RevenueCat, to make sure developers can make a living doing what they love, without having to focus on boring infrastructure.",
