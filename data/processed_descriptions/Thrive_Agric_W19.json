With a strong team of 227 dedicated employees, Thrive Agric is on a mission to empower farmers across Africa by providing them with accessible finance, insights, and markets.\n\n**Mission**  \nThrive Agric's mission is simple yet profound: to help farmers in Africa thrive by linking them to essential resources that enable crop growth and maximize profitability. The company aims to ensure food security for all through innovative technology solutions.\n\n**What They Do**  \nThrive Agric started as a marketplace for agro-commodities but has grown into a comprehensive ecosystem that supports smallholder farmers. Their approach includes:\n\n1. **Farmer Onboarding:** Collecting essential data about farmers and organizing them into community clusters for better support and education.\n   \n2. **Farm Mapping:** Evaluating farmland characteristics, which helps tailor financial support based on real needs.\n   \n3. **Input Distribution:** Offering loans in the form of farm inputs such as seeds and fertilizers, rather than cash, ensuring that resources reach the farmers directly.\n   \n4. **Field Monitoring:** Assigning field officers to guide farmers using best practices to ensure successful harvests.\n   \n5. **Harvesting & Inventory Management:** Facilitating logistics for harvest collection and managing post-harvest inventory to ensure efficient supply chain operations.\n\n**Impact**  \nThrive Agric's influence is tangible:  \n- **850,000 farmers onboarded.**  \n- **2,700 communities reached.**  \n- **1,700,000 grains produced and traded.**  \n- **9,000 jobs created.**  \n\nThese numbers illustrate Thrive Agric's commitment to transforming agriculture in Africa, linking farmers to broader markets while enhancing productivity and livelihoods.\n\n**Recognition**  \nThe company celebrates notable achievements, including Uka Eje being named to the 2024 TIME100 Climate List. This recognition underscores Thrive Agric's impact on climate action through sustainable agricultural practices.\n\n**Future Aspirations**  \nThrive Agric aims to build the largest network of profitable African farmers through technology, fostering sustainable practices that benefit both the farmers and the globe. Their work not only addresses food security but also contributes to economic growth and social inclusion across Africa.\n\n**Get Involved**  \nFor those interested in joining the movement, Thrive Agric invites individuals to become a part of their community, offering career opportunities and ways to support the mission of empowering farmers.\n\n**Learn More**  \nTo explore more about Thrive Agric and their initiatives, visit their [website](https://www.thriveagric.com/).",
