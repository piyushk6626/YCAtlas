With a core team of five, the startup is laser-focused on delivering a full-stack API and management platform designed for dashboards and reporting. This is not just another tool; it\u2019s built specifically for customer-facing applications which means it\u2019s doing something pretty niche.\n\nInitially launched as a React Library, Quill has evolved into an API and Management Toolkit that offers businesses a simple way to present data.

With Quill, companies can trust that their data is secure while still taking advantage of powerful analytics tools.\n\n### Performance Metrics\nIn less than a year, Quill has already showcased impressive usage stats, with over **56,456 transactions** in just the last 90 days, translating to about **$123,456 in revenue**.
