Based in Amsterdam, with a dedicated team of just three, Echoes HQ is laser-focused on bridging the gap between engineering work and business outcomes.\n\n### The Essence of Echoes HQ\n\nAt its core, Echoes HQ seeks to provide engineering leaders with visibility into how their teams\u2019 efforts align with broader business goals.
