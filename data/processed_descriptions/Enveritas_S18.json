    "generated_description": "Enveritas is a New York-based organization that focuses on ensuring ethical practices within global supply chains, particularly pertaining to sustainability in the coffee industry. Founded in 2016 and backed by Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2018 batch, Enveritas has grown to a team of 60 dedicated employees. Their mission is to tackle critical issues like child slavery and environmental degradation by providing thorough verification of coffee farms worldwide.\n\nWhat sets Enveritas apart is their innovative approach to sustainability assurance. They aim to help smallholder coffee farmers by eliminating fees for them, meaning that the coffee roasters actually pay for the assessment process. This inclusivity allows more farmers\u2014regardless of their farm's size or location\u2014to access sustainable export markets.\n\nTheir methodology includes utilizing advanced geospatial analytics and satellite imagery to monitor farm practices, thereby ensuring that they meet high environmental and social standards. In 2022, Enveritas plans to visit 50,000 farms across over 20 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, assessing their social, economic, and environmental practices.\n\nTo receive a responsible sourcing claim from Enveritas, coffee companies must undergo an independent annual assessment, address identified issues in alignment with their purchases, and evaluate their efforts to create real impact. This tiered approach not only fosters accountability but also provides actionable insights for supply chain participants and policymakers.\n\nSo, if you're looking to understand how sustainability and ethics can be integrated into the global supply chain\u2014particularly in coffee production\u2014Enveritas is a fascinating example of this growing movement. They\u2019re genuinely working to protect our environment while enhancing the livelihoods of coffee farmers through integrity-driven practices.",
