    "generated_description": "**Forge Automation: Revolutionizing CNC Machining**\n\nFounded in 2022 and based in Toronto, Canada, Forge Automation is on a mission to redefine the custom metal parts industry by delivering CNC parts in an astonishing four days or less. With a team of seven, the company emerged from Y Combinator's W25 batch, gaining traction in the competitive landscape of hardware, robotics, and manufacturing.\n\nImagine being a mechanical engineer who needs low-volume CNC parts\u2014traditionally, you'd expect to wait two to three weeks. Forge Automation flips that expectation on its head. Their platform allows users to upload a CAD model, and just like that, with a few clicks, engineers can enjoy the \"Amazon experience\" of fast and reliable CNC parts delivery.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. **Upload Your Part:** Users can easily upload their design files directly onto Forge's user-friendly platform.\n2. **Instant Pricing:** Once a design is uploaded, users receive instant quotes, with options to adjust lead times based on their needs.\n3. **Rapid Production:** Parts are manufactured the moment they're ordered, ensuring quick turnaround times.\n4. **Quick Shipping:** Expect free shipping to get your parts delivered within 1-2 days after production.\n\nForge's capabilities are focused on CNC milling, utilizing a fleet of 3-axis CNC mills located in Canada. They have a minimum part size of 0.125\" cubed and can accommodate parts up to 24\" x 12\" x 4\". Their material offerings include various aluminum alloys, stainless steels, and plastics, with stock always on hand to expedite the order process. \n\nMoreover, Forge emphasizes precise tolerances, maintaining a default tolerance of \u00b10.005\" but can achieve tighter specifications down to \u00b10.001\". They also provide finishing options, which can be completed quickly leveraging in-house tools and trusted suppliers.\n\nBeing part of Y Combinator and having the guidance of Michael Seibel as their group partner adds a level of credibility and network strength to their operations, positioning Forge Automation as a forward-thinking player ready to challenge industry norms.\n\nFor more information, insights, and to start ordering your parts, visit [Forge Automation](https://www.forgeautomation.ca). \n\nIn a nutshell, Forge Automation is a game-changer for engineers who need speed and efficiency\u2014changing the centuries-old paradigm of manufacturing into something that fits the pace of today's market.",
