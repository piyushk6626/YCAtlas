They use multiple tools to budget, split, track and settle expenses. They also prefer a quick and digital banking experience. \r\nHowever, the traditional joint account is still only accessible to married couples, takes days to open and is very limited in its expense management features & user experience.\r\n\nCoupl lets any young couple (regardless of their marital status) open a digital joint wallet in under 60 seconds using the mobile app - without ever having to visit a physical bank branch.\r\nCustomers can use the Coupl wallet to pool in money together and pay for shared expenses using our RuPay cards.",
