The app not only caters to the readers but also empowers creators. Their innovative AI Comics Studio significantly reduces the cost of comic production \u2014 up to ten times cheaper than traditional methods \u2014 while maintaining high quality. This means that both established and emerging artists can bring their stories to life.\n\nThe stories are penned by bestselling authors from popular platforms like BookTok, Kindle, and Wattpad, ensuring that the content is engaging and resonates with the audience.\n\n**Team and Location**\n\nNestled in the vibrant tech hub of San Francisco, Shortbread operates with a lean team of five dedicated employees.
