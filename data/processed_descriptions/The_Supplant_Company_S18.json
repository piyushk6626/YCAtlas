Supplant\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 sugars from fiber is a brand-new blend of sugars found naturally in plant fiber. With Supplant\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 sugars from fiber, your favorite treats can look, feel and taste like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to. Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made from fiber, Supplant\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 sugars from fiber is lower in calories, has a lower glycemic response (compared to glucose), and is prebiotic. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made by upcycling agricultural side-streams. For example, in corn (maize), it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made from the cob, not the kernel. In wheat and rice, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made from the straw, not the grain. These fiber-rich parts of crops are hugely abundant and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically make their way into the food system.",
