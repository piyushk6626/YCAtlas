Pick out what you want to work on today by importing your tasks and meetings for the day from your various tools. Decide how much time you want to spend on each item to make sure you're setting realistic goals for yourself.\r\n\nAs the day goes on, stay focused. Concentrate on one task at a time. Keep track of how long you've been working, and when it's time to shift your attention to something else.\r\n\nWhen you're done, shut down for the day. Reflect on what you were able to accomplish. End the day feeling satisfied with what you could do rather than consumed by what you couldn't.\r\n\nSunsama is built to improve your relationship with your work. Work should be an engine for fulfillment, not for stress and anxiety.",
