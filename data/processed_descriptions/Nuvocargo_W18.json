Nuvocargo is currently about 150 employees between the US and LatAm, raised $75M from investors like Tiger Global, QED, NFX, among others and is valued at over $250M since launching 3 years ago. Before that went through a hard pivot post YC and had some ups/downs.\n\nI love startups, real estate, and anything at the intersection of the US and Latin America. I occasionally angel invest and many of those have been other YC co's.",
