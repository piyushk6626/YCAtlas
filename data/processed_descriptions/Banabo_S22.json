The company aims to eliminate marketing waste\u2014essentially, ensuring that every dollar spent on marketing is accounted for and effective. Their focus is on tracing the entire journey of a website visitor leading up to a sale, thereby highlighting the true impact of each marketing touchpoint.\n\n### The Problem It Solves\nIn the evolving landscape of digital privacy, accurate marketing attribution has become a challenge. GDPR in the EU, CCPA in California, and significant changes from iOS 14 have complicated how companies track user behavior. To add to that, Google\u2019s ban on tracking cookies in 2023 has left many companies scrambling for solutions. Enter Banabo, with its innovative, fully cookieless marketing attribution system that respects user privacy by not relying on personal data.\n\n### What They Offer\nBanabo provides a unique attribution operating system (OS) that enables businesses to measure the effectiveness of their marketing efforts without the need for cookies or personal data. This positions them not only as a tool to allocate marketing spend efficiently but also as a compliant solution in a world increasingly concerned with digital privacy.\n\n### Key Partner\nNicolas Dessaigne serves as the Group Partner at Banabo, contributing valuable expertise to the startup's growth journey.\n\n### Current Status\nThough still early in its development with a small team, Banabo is setting itself up as a pioneering force in marketing analytics, catering primarily to B2B clients who want to maximize their marketing ROI while remaining compliant with privacy regulations.\n\nIn summary, Banabo isn't just building a product; they\u2019re redefining how businesses understand their marketing performance in a cookie-less, privacy-conscious world. If your company is ready to ditch marketing waste, Banabo might just be the partner you\u2019ve been looking for.",
