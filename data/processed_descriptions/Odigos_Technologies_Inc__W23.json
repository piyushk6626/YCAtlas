Summary\n\n**Founded:** 2023  \n**Location:** Boston, Massachusetts  \n**Team Size:** 16 Employees  \n**Batch:** Y Combinator W23  \n**Group Partner:** Diana Hu\n\n**Mission:**  \nOdigos Technologies Inc. is determined to redefine monitoring data quality with its enterprise-grade OpenTelemetry solution. They're leveraging advanced eBPF technology to create an open-source approach that automates the generation of distributed traces for any application\u2014no engineering work required. This is a game-changer for developers who have long struggled with gathering and delivering high-quality monitoring data efficiently.\n\n**The Problem:**  \nToday\u2019s developers face enormous hurdles when it comes to implementing monitoring pipelines. The traditional process can take months, is fraught with errors, and often involves extensive code changes across multiple research and development teams. Collaboration is key, and it\u2019s a tedious endeavor.\n\n**What They Offer:**  \nOdigos simplifies the OpenTelemetry implementation process. By using their eBPF-based solution, they provide a zero-code, zero-performance overhead approach that enables deeper tracing. This drastically reduces the time and effort typically required for deployment. On their website, you can find resources including:\n\n- [About](https://odigos.io/about)\n- [Blog](https://odigos.io/blog)\n- [Pricing](https://odigos.io/pricing)\n- [Documentation](https://docs.odigos.io)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos)\n\n**Why It Matters:**  \nIn essence, Odigos is addressing a critical pain point in the developer community, enabling teams to focus on building rather than maintaining complex monitoring systems. With backing from Y Combinator and an innovative approach grounded in cutting-edge technology, they are poised to make significant waves in the tech landscape.\n\nFor more details, check out their [website](https://odigos.io).",
