By doing so, we will be able to underwrite risk, set prices and, ultimately, become owners of the product.\r\n\nOnce approved, around summer 22, we will be in a great position to size the $13bn untapped opportunity of +30 Mn uninsured vehicles \u2013 just in Mexico! As we will be able to attack the main pain points in the market: i) antiquated underwriting models and ii) payment conditions only adapted for the affluent.\r\n\nTo succeed, we have assembled an elite team with both innovative and experienced profiles. We are three cofounders, two ex-McKinsey and one ex-P&G, and we managed to attract two heavyweights of the Mexican insurance industry: the previous CUO of Zurich Mexico and the previous CFO and VP of Finance of ING and AXA Mexico.",

With a mission to develop a full-stack auto insurer, they specifically target the significantly underserved market of over 30 million uninsured vehicles in Mexico, tapping into a $13 billion industry opportunity.\n\nJust over a year into their journey, Momento has navigated a demanding regulatory process and has received approval to become a fully licensed insurance carrier. This status empowers them to underwrite risk and set prices, establishing their stake in the marketplace. The company combines the expertise of its three co-founders\u2014two hailing from McKinsey and one from Procter & Gamble\u2014with seasoned veterans from leading Mexican insurance firms, including former executives from Zurich and AXA.\n\nMomento operates with a team of 18 dedicated professionals and prides itself on leveraging advanced technology, particularly machine learning, to deliver insurance products tailored for the everyday customer. Their approach seeks to address the pain points of traditional insurers, focusing on outdated underwriting methods and payment plans that often exclude those who cannot afford them.\n\nTheir offerings are designed with flexibility in mind\u2014customers can choose to pay monthly, quarterly, or annually, ensuring that financial access isn't a barrier to obtaining vital auto insurance coverage. The platform is entirely digital, allowing users to manage their policies, report incidents, and seek assistance seamlessly through an app or their website.\n\nAt its core, Momento is about transparency and innovation in insurance. They promise a straightforward experience devoid of the convoluted fine print and complications that often accompany traditional policies. Instead, they use AI to generate customized rates based on a comprehensive understanding of each customer\u2019s risk profile, making the process tailored and fair.\n\nBacked by renowned investors from Y Combinator and Foundation Capital, Momento is positioned to transform auto insurance in Mexico, making it accessible and user-friendly.\n\nFor more about Momento and to get a quote, you can visit their website [here](https://www.tumomento.com). \n\nIn summary, Momento is not just selling insurance; they\u2019re selling peace of mind, accessibility, and a modern approach to a field that\u2019s long overdue for disruption.",
