    "description": "Gullak is a mobile app that automates savings & invests these in Gold. We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.\r\n\nIndia is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. \r\n\nGold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.\r\n\nUsing automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. \r\n\nWith 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.\r\n\nGullak\u2019s Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day. This is the same team that has built more than 40+ consumer brands & their initial growth strategy.",

    "generated_description": "# Gullak Money: An Insight into Automated Savings in Gold\n\n**Gullak Money** is reimagining the way Indians save and invest by leveraging the cultural affinity for gold. Launched just 60 days ago, this fintech start-up has experienced rapid growth, scaling to **40,000 transacting users** and achieving a **monthly Gross Transaction Value (GTV) of $280,000**\u2014and growing at a **25% week-over-week** rate. \n\n### Mission and Vision\n\nAt the core of Gullak's mission is the automation of savings and investing those savings in gold, a cherished asset in India. Currently, around **200 million Indians** save manually in traditional banking options, which often provide returns that hardly keep pace with inflation. Gullak aims to nudge these savers towards smarter, wealth-creating methods.\n\n### The Gold Affinity\n\nGold purchases in India hit approximately **$30 billion annually**, predominantly from middle-income households. Despite gold's historical performance (typically yielding **5% more** than bank deposits), many individuals remain stuck in less effective savings habits due to the cumbersome nature of acquiring and storing physical gold.\n\nGullak simplifies this by allowing users to automate small, regular savings (starting at just **$1 a day**) into **digital gold**. This capability only became feasible with the rise of UPI Autopay, which has made recurring transactions seamless.\n\n### Market Potential\n\nWith an estimated **50 million Indians** saving $2 daily, and considering gold-backed lending opportunities, the market potential is projected to be around **$1.5 billion**. This presents an exciting horizon for a company like Gullak, which is strategically positioned at the intersection of saving, investing, and the gold market.\n\n### The Team Behind Gullak\n\nThe founding team is notable, having previously developed the **BHIM UPI App**, which saw **10 million downloads within 10 days** of launch. This group comes with substantial experience in building large-scale payment systems for leading partners like **Google Pay** and **Amazon**, processing over **30 million payments daily**. They have also been instrumental in creating over **40 consumer brands** in their previous ventures.\n\n### Recent Progress\n\nFounded in **2022** and part of the **Y Combinator Batch S22**, Gullak has quickly built a solid foundation with a dedicated team of **15 employees** based in **Bengaluru, India**. Recently, they secured **INR 10 crore in pre-seed funding** from well-reputed investors like **Better Capital** and **Stellaris Venture Partners**.\n\n### User Experience and Features\n\nGullak's app is designed to simplify saving, allowing users to:\n- Set automatic payments and reminders,\n- Invest in **100% secure 24k gold**,\n- Save as little as **\u20b950/day**, \n- Withdraw savings in cash or gold at any time.\n\nAdditionally, it includes features such as **daily savings plans**, **gold delivery** options, and opportunities to earn rewards through referrals or special occasions\u2014making the platform not just a savings tool but a rewarding experience.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGullak Money is fundamentally changing the way individuals in India save and invest, marrying a time-honored tradition with modern technology. By automating the process and making it user-friendly, they not only provide better returns than traditional savings methods but also empower users to cultivate a more secure financial future in a culturally significant asset class.
