Enter *Codes Health*, founded in 2024 and emerging out of Y Combinator's S24 batch. With a mission aimed at creating perfect medical histories, Codes Health aims to eliminate the chaos of scattered documents across electronic health records (EHRs), providers, and faxes. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, they compile and analyze necessary documents into cohesive patient histories that are easy to access and understand.\n\nBased in New York, Codes Health operates with a lean team of three\u2014yes, just three folks pushing a big idea. Their offering serves both healthcare providers and lawyers, aligning clinical needs with legal documentation in a seamless service. The company focuses on pulling live patient documentation from major health information exchanges, gathering records from previous providers, and even processing patient-held files. It\u2019s an efficient way for both practitioners and patients to manage medical history, reducing time and improving accuracy.\n\nOne standout feature? Their digital intake and release of information (ROI) process helps ensure that patients can complete their release forms correctly\u2014right from their phones. They even verify provider information to eliminate common entry mistakes and provide real-time updates for requests, acting almost like the most diligent assistant your backoffice could dream of.\n\nCodes Health is tagging itself as part of the *health-tech*, *B2B*, *legaltech*, and of course, *AI* sectors\u2014demonstrating their aim to revolutionize how medical information flows in the digital age. The backing of notable investors like Y Combinator, Haystack Ventures, Night Capital, General Catalyst, and Pathlight Ventures brings a level of credibility and excitement to their endeavor.\n\nAs they continue to grow, Codes Health is making patient record automation not just a dream but an achievable reality, one document at a time. If you\u2019re looking to make sense of the medical record mess, you might want to look into what they\u2019re doing or book a demo to see their solution in action.\n\nFor more on how they're changing the healthcare documentation landscape, check out [Codes Health](https://www.getcodeshealth.com/).",
