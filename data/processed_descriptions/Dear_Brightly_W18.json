    "generated_description": "**Dear Brightly: Your Online Prescription Skincare Solution**\n\nFounded in 2018 and proudly part of Y Combinator's Batch W18, Dear Brightly is tackling a common problem in skincare: access to effective, dermatologist-vetted prescription products. Located in the heart of San Francisco, with a compact team of three, this startup is making waves in the telehealth space by offering personalized skincare solutions with a tech twist.\n\nThe mission is simple yet impactful: to provide people with tailored, prescription-strength skincare that fosters healthy skin. This is done entirely online, eliminating the need for in-person dermatologist visits. The process is straightforward and user-friendly; customers share their skin goals via a secure telehealth portal, and then licensed doctors create a personalized serum, like their flagship product, the **Night Shift** retinoid serum. \n\n### Why Retinoids?\n\nPrescription-strength retinoids, such as those offered by Dear Brightly, are significantly more potent than over-the-counter alternatives\u2014around 20 times stronger, in fact. They\u2019re the only FDA-approved treatment for photoaging, backed by over 50 years of research underscoring their efficacy and safety. For those seeking real results, this could make all the difference.\n\n### The Experience\n\nStarting your skincare journey is as easy as 1-2-3:\n1. **Share Your Goals**: No need to visit a clinic; just upload some pictures and answer questions about your skin.\n2. **Tailored Formulation**: A qualified dermatologist reviews your information and customizes a serum specifically for you.\n3. **Ongoing Support**: Regular follow-ups with your skin coach ensure that you\u2019re on the right track\u2014just like a fitness routine, gradual progress is the key.\n\n### Community Feedback\n\nClients rave about the ease of ordering, the quality of the product, and the responsiveness of dermatologists. Users have reported visible improvements in their skin within just a few weeks, highlighting the difference that a tailored regimen can make without unnecessary irritation.\n\n### Start Your Journey\n\nDear Brightly isn't just about selling products; it's about demystifying skincare and making effective, prescription treatments accessible to everyone. Forget waiting rooms and hefty fees\u2014your best skin is just a few clicks away.\n\nFor more information, check out their website at [dearbrightly.com](https://www.dearbrightly.com).",
