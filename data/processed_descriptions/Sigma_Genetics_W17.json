    "description": "Sigma Genetics develops devices that can deliver DNA, RNA, and other charged molecules into cells by using magnetic fields. When compared to conventional electroporation, this technique has several key advantages, which include: the absence of arcing, the ability to scale, and the benefit of being non-invasive for in vivo applications. This platform technology can be applied to a wide range of applications- cell therapies, cancer drug delivery, DNA vaccines, biopharma manufacturing, and cosmetics.",
