Their platform offers key insights into code behavior, revealing anti-patterns that hinder teams from achieving their goals. By breaking down these codebases into manageable domains\u2014essentially logical areas of functionality\u2014Axal quantifies technical debt using KPIs. This enables executives to focus their modernization efforts where they matter most, ensuring that teams tackle the most critical work first.\n\n### How It Works\nThe **Axal Observability Platform** simplifies codebase modernization through a three-step process:\n1. **Observe:** The platform analyzes runtime behavior and static dependencies to map out business domain boundaries, pinpointing where improvements can make the most impact.\n2. **Diagnose:** It identifies specific technical barriers, such as domain exclusivity violations or circular dependencies, creating a clear roadmap for architectural updates.\n3. **Fix:** Leveraging autonomous AI, Axal implements required code changes while ensuring that all tests pass, streamlining the transition process.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Auto-mapping:** Documenting every class and interaction for full visibility.\n- **Strategic Planning:** Associating classes and methods with business domains to expedite decision-making.\n- **Continuous Adaptation:** Adjusting to code changes seamlessly, removing the stress of constant re-architecting.\n- **Supports Various Technologies:** Works with popular languages including Java, C#, JavaScript, Go, and Python.\n\n### Core Principles\nAxal advocates for using established design patterns like **Domain-Driven Design** and the **Strangler Fig Pattern**. These methodologies facilitate an incremental and less risky transition from monolithic architectures to modular systems, enhancing both team autonomy and application scalability.\n\n### Who Benefits?\n- **Executives** gain insights into resource allocation and effort expectations for architectural transitions.\n- **Architects** receive automated mapping and a structured roadmap, making planning meetings a thing of the past.\n- **Engineers** can focus on delivering features faster, freeing them from tedious architectural refactoring.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn the fast-paced tech environment, organizations can\u2019t afford to let legacy systems hold them back. Axal steps up to the plate by demystifying the challenges of modernization, turning what once was a daunting task into a systematic process. With their clear focus on reducing technical debt, they empower organizations to innovate more effectively.\n\nFor more on how Axal facilitates architectural clean-up, visit their [website](https://www.axal.ai).",
