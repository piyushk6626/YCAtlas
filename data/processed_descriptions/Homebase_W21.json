With its mission to provide personalized rent-to-own real estate financing, Homebase stands as a compelling alternative to the rigid and often exorbitantly priced mortgages (12%+ interest rates) that dominate the region. \n\nFounded during the Y Combinator Batch W21, Homebase has garnered support from prominent investors including VinaCapital Ventures and Class 5 Global, as well as industry veterans from companies like Opendoor and Divvy Homes. With a dynamic team of around 20 based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, they\u2019re set to disrupt traditional home financing with innovative, empathetic solutions for aspiring homeowners.\n\n### Services Offered\n\nHomebase primarily serves three types of clients:\n- **Homebuyers:** They can purchase properties with as little as 8% down and benefit from financing that supports up to 80% of the home value. This service is designed to make homeownership accessible without the usual mountains of paperwork or stringent income verification common in traditional lending.\n  \n- **Homeowners:** For current homeowners, Homebase offers products that allow them to unlock up to 80% of their home's value, presenting a more flexible alternative to standard mortgages.\n  \n- **Investors:** Homebase provides opportunities for investors to earn passive income by supporting homebuyers in securing bank loans, all without requiring initial capital.\n\n### The Landscape\n\nHomebase is well-positioned within the fintech and proptech fields, seeking to enhance life in Asia by making property investment achievable for more people. The company has won accolades, such as being recognized by Plug & Play Center and KPMG, and has been featured in notable publications like Forbes and Vietcetera.\n\n### Community Impact\n\nThe company is more than just a financial institution; it aims to empower individuals by turning homeownership dreams into reality across Southeast Asia.
