With projections suggesting that this demographic will grow to 140 million over the next decade, Heyfood forecasts a substantial opportunity. They estimate that if each of these individuals orders food just once a week, that creates a potential market worth $51 billion. By charging a modest $1 per delivery, they're tapping into a lucrative pool that is both sizable and increasingly tech-savvy.\n\nHeyfood is part of the Y Combinator Batch W22, placing it among a lineage of successful startups. Despite being a small team of five, they are well-connected, with Michael Seibel as their Group Partner. This lean structure positions them to iterate quickly and respond to the African market's unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nIn simple terms, Heyfood is working to make ordering from your favorite restaurants as easy as clicking a button. They're not just building a delivery service; they\u2019re creating an ecosystem that promises to transform how food is accessed in urban Africa.\n\nFor more information, you can check out their website at [Heyfood](https://heyfood.africa/). \n\nIn summary, Heyfood is a refreshing example of how startups in emerging markets can not only adapt proven models from the West but enhance them by focusing on sustainability and direct profitability. With an eye toward the future, they\u2019re well-positioned to meet the growing demand for food delivery services across the continent.",
