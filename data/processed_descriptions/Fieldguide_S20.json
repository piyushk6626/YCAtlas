The company's mission? To provide Vertical AI solutions specifically tailored for the assurance industry, bridging the gap between outdated practices and modern needs.\n\n**Why Fieldguide Stands Out**\n\nFieldguide was born from the insights of former Big Four practitioners and seasoned technology leaders. These founders have crafted a platform that digitizes the entire engagement workflow, allowing firms to manage their processes in a single, cohesive environment. This means improved efficiency, higher margins, and stronger client relationships\u2014essentially everything modern firms need to thrive.\n\nThe platform has caught the attention of some heavyweight investors, including Bessemer Venture Partners, Y Combinator, and Eric Ries, the author of \"The Lean Startup.\" With such backing, it's no surprise that Fieldguide has rapidly gained traction among top CPA firms.\n\n**What They Offer**\n\nFieldguide\u2019s suite of products is designed to meet the varied needs of audit and advisory firms. Here are some key features:\n\n1. **Fieldguide AI**: A cutting-edge tool designed to enhance advisory and audit practices through artificial intelligence.\n2. **Engagement Hub**: Offers end-to-end management for advisory engagements, streamlining workflows and collaboration.\n3. **Document Management**: Automates workpaper management, making it easier than ever to handle documentation.\n4. **Reporting Automation**: Supports generating and collaborating on high-quality reports, saving firms countless hours.\n\n**Client-Centric Solutions**\n\nFieldguide isn't just about improving internal processes; it's also about elevating the client experience. Their Client Hub delivers a modern, user-friendly interface that clients actually appreciate, making it easier to engage with advisory and audit services.\n\n**Proven Impact**\n\nWith a team of around 80 employees and strategic guidance from Group Partner Michael Seibel, Fieldguide is not just a tool; it\u2019s a partner in growth for firms. Clients have reported impressive results, including:\n\n- Increases in engagement realization by up to **25%** thanks to automated report generation.\n- **66% less time** spent drafting test procedures through the use of AI technologies.\n- Firms experiencing growth rates of **5x** due to enhanced operational efficiencies.\n\n**The Future Looks Bright**\n\nFieldguide is positioned firmly at the intersection of AI and auditing\u2014a space ripe with opportunities as firms strive to modernize their operations. If you're in the audit or consulting fields and want to harness the power of AI and automation, Fieldguide just might be your answer.\n\nFor more information, you can visit their website at [fieldguide.io](http://fieldguide.io).",
