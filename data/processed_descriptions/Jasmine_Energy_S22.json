Initially focused on making the buying and selling of renewable energy assets straightforward, Jasmine has evolved into a pivotal platform enabling transparency and accessibility in renewable energy exchanges.\n\nBeing part of Y Combinator's Batch S22 lends credibility, and with a nimble team of six, Jasmine is poised for growth. Leading the charge is Gustaf Alstromer, their Group Partner, who adds significant value to the company's vision.\n\n#### What Jasmine Energy Does\n\nJasmine specializes in managing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)\u2014an essential component of the renewable energy ecosystem. They simplify the cumbersome processes involved in registration, data management, and broker transactions of RECs.

Jasmine ensures no hidden fees creep in, offering transparent pricing and straightforward contracting that caters to various capacities.\n\n#### Audience and Services\n\nJasmine Energy tailors its services to three main groups:\n\n1. **Homeowners with Rooftop Solar** - Aimed at maximizing the value of their energy production while managing RECs efficiently.\n2. **Third-Party Owners (TPO)** - For those owning small-scale solar systems, Jasmine offers a way to manage RECs with ease.\n3. **Independent Power Producers (IPP)** - Catering to utility-scale producers by optimizing REC value and handling the bureaucratic load.\n\nEach category has tailored fee structures, designed to ensure that users can capitalize on their contributions to green energy.\n\n#### Why It Matters\n\nAt its core, Jasmine Energy is not just about trading energy certificates; it\u2019s about building a more transparent and inclusive market for climate assets. With a focus on decentralization and accessibility, they aim to democratize the renewable energy landscape.\n\nTheir intuitive platform aligns perfectly with the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions, reflective of a shifting societal mindset toward environmental responsibility.
