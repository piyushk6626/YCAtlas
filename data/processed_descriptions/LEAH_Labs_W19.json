    "description": "LEAH Labs is building living therapies for pets first, and their people next. We're first focused on CAR-T cell therapy for dogs with B cell lymphoma, the naturally occurring clinical analog of human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CAR-T cells are curative in humans, and our early results are showing the same - we're inducing remissions in pets with late stage lymphomas. Our virus-free gene editing platform allows us to engineer a dose of CAR-T cell therapy for ~$500, and brings the promise of a curative outcome. Given our safety and efficacy data to date, we believe this product could be used by general practice veterinarians, meaning we have thousands of customers all across the USA who typically treat with palliative care or refer cancer patients to specialty oncologists. Our CAR-T cell platform is regulated by the USDA, not the FDA, affording us a cost effective \"full stack\" to iterate and innovate on CAR-T cell therapy from a hypothesis through clinical validation.",

    "generated_description": "LEAH Labs is shaking up the veterinary world with a fresh approach to cancer treatment for pets. Founded in 2018 in Rochester, MN, and a proud member of Y Combinator's W19 batch, the company is laser-focused on developing living therapies primarily through CAR-T cell therapy. Their mission? \"Living therapies for pets first, and their people next.\" This highlights a commitment not just to the well-being of animals but also acknowledges the impact these innovations will have on the owners who care for them.\n\nCancer is no small adversary, affecting approximately 6 million dogs in the U.S. each year. LEAH Labs is tackling this head-on with a groundbreaking approach that mirrors successful treatments in humans. Their CAR-T cell therapy, proven curative in human cases of B-cell lymphoma (akin to the dog equivalent), has shown promising early results in putting pets into remission. Remarkably, they've managed to reduce the cost of this revolutionary treatment to about $500 per dose, thanks to a virus-free gene editing platform.\n\nWhat sets LEAH Labs apart is not only their innovative treatment but also their operational savvy. Their CAR-T therapy is regulated by the USDA rather than the FDA, which allows them greater leeway to iterate quickly and effectively on their products. This means that general practice veterinarians across the country, many of whom typically offer palliative care or refer cases to specialists, could potentially adopt their therapies.\n\nWith a lean team of three and strong backing from notable investors like Y Combinator, AgStartup Engine, and FIN Capital, LEAH Labs is primed for growth and impact. They\u2019ve also secured grants from organizations like the NSF and NIH, demonstrating a solid foundation and trust from the broader scientific community.\n\nIn the landscape of veterinary medicine, LEAH Labs is both a pioneer and a crucial player in championing a new era of treatment that brings hope not just to our pets but also to their people.
