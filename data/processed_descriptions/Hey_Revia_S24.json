The company, which is part of Y Combinator's Summer 2024 batch, aims to automate complex phone calls for healthcare providers, making the often tedious process of communication much more efficient.\n\n### Mission and Offerings\nHey Revia's mission is simple yet impactful: to eliminate the hassle of complex phone calls in healthcare. Their software handles everything from navigating difficult phone menus to verifying provider details and updating insurance information. By automating these tasks, Hey Revia reduces hold times and allows healthcare providers to focus on what truly matters\u2014patient care. Their platform is accessible as a web app, mobile app, and API, making it versatile for users.\n\n### Key Features\n1. **Credentialing:** Automates verification of healthcare provider credentials to ensure compliance.\n2. **Prior Authorization:** Streamlines the process to speed up patient care.\n3. **Referrals and Specialist Consultations:** Facilitates the coordination of patient referrals.\n4. **Billing and Payment Inquiries:** Manages billing issues and insurance claims.\n\n### Testimonials and Effectiveness\nUsers have reported significant time savings.
