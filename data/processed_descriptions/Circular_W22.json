Operating out of Singapore, it employs a dedicated team of 25 individuals. The company is primarily focused on revolutionizing how consumers access technology through a subscription model, making it a central player in the Asian market for consumer electronics.\n\n**Mission**\nThe mission of Circular is straightforward yet impactful: to promote the circular economy by providing convenient, affordable subscriptions for consumer electronics throughout Asia. By transitioning from ownership to rental, Circular aims to redefine our relationship with technology.\n\n**What They Offer**\nCircular has designed its services to cater to the tech-savvy consumer who wants access to the latest gadgets\u2014think smartphones, laptops, VR equipment, and gaming gear\u2014without the hefty price tag associated with outright purchases. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Choose**: Customers select the device they want and determine their subscription length.\n2. **Order**: After creating an account, they\u2019ll receive confirmation of their spending power.\n3. **Delivery**: Devices are delivered for free right to the customer\u2019s doorstep.\n4. **Options**: At the end of the subscription, users can choose to upgrade, extend, or return the device.\n\nIf a customer decides to return a device, Circular refurbishes and rents it out again, extending its lifecycle and reducing waste\u2014a win-win for consumers and the planet.\n\n**Business Model**\nBy promoting a subscription model, Circular encourages users to experience ownership without the commitment. This approach not only aligns with sustainability but also reflects changing consumer preferences, where renting is becoming as accepted as owning.\n\n**Target Market**\nCircular primarily operates in Singapore and Australia, two regions with high technology adoption rates. By tapping into these markets, Circular caters to a tech-savvy, environmentally-conscious demographic looking for budget-friendly options.\n\n**Industry Positioning**\nCircular positions itself at the intersection of several industries, tagged under fintech, marketplace, consumer electronics, and e-commerce. This broad positioning enables it to be flexible and innovative in how it addresses consumer needs.\n\n**Team and Support**\nBacking and mentorship from seasoned partners, including Dalton Caldwell from Y Combinator, provide Circular with the resources needed to thrive and innovate in this space.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn a world where tech gadgets cycle in and out of trend at breakneck speed, Circular offers a refreshing approach\u2014subscription over ownership. Their commitment to sustainability and customer satisfaction places them on a promising trajectory, aligned with modern consumption behaviors and environmental needs.\n\nFor more information, visit [Circular's website](https://www.nowcircular.com).",
