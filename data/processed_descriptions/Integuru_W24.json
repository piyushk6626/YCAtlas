It\u2019s a space that many developers find frustrating, and Integuru is here to change that.\n\n### Mission\nInteguru's mission is simple and powerful: **Integrations without official APIs**. They\u2019re on a quest to democratize access to data through innovative integration solutions.\n\n### The Technology\nInteguru stands out for developing the first AI agent designed to create permissionless integrations by reverse-engineering internal APIs. This means they can help businesses connect their tools in ways that were previously impossible or cumbersome.

They\u2019re also open to special requests from enterprises.\n\n### User-Friendly Approach\nTheir integrations are open-source by default, a testament to their commitment to transparency and community collaboration. They encourage users to leverage their AI agent, making third-party integration creation more accessible. You can dive into their work via their [GitHub Repo](https://www.integuru.ai/<https:/github.com/Integuru-AI/Integuru>).\n\n### Trust and Partnerships\nInteguru has quickly garnered trust from notable companies like Andy AI, Cal.com, Electric Air, Luminai, and more. This speaks volumes about their credibility and the value they provide.\n\n### The Team\nDespite being a small team of two, Integuru is making big waves.
