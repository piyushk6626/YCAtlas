    "generated_description": "Farcast is a forward-thinking company based in San Francisco, established in 2019 and part of Y Combinator's W20 batch. They've taken on a mission that's both ambitious and essential: building advanced satellite communication (satcom) user terminals. This isn't just tech for tech's sake; it's about democratizing access to the internet, particularly in regions where it\u2019s sorely lacking. Currently, one in three people around the globe lacks adequate internet access, and Farcast sees their technology as a potential game-changer.\n\nOriginally branded as UTVATE, the company has changed its name but retained its focus on innovation. It's a small but agile team, with about 12 employees, spearheaded by CEO Siamak Ebadi and guided by Group Partner Jared Friedman. Their technology centers around cutting-edge Flat Panel Antennas (FPAs) that effectively tackle the challenges of satellite tracking through electronic beam scanning. Simply put, they make satellite internet more accessible, smaller, lighter, and cheaper\u2014what they term \"SWaP-C\" (Size, Weight, Power, and Cost).\n\nTheir clientele is impressive too, boasting partnerships with notable companies like Viasat and the Air Force. The Farcast team is committed to bridging the digital divide, believing that internet access should be a right, not a privilege. With the support of key investors and a solid foundation, they\u2019re on a path to unlock global prosperity through better connectivity.\n\nIn terms of company culture, they\u2019re focused on creating a rewarding workplace, offering benefits like unlimited PTO, parental leave, 401(k) matching, and more. As they continue to grow, they\u2019re not just looking for employees; they\u2019re inviting like-minded innovators to join them in their mission to change how the world connects. \n\nIf you're intrigued by their vision of a connected future, you can find out more at [Farcast\u2019s website](https://www.farcast.com/).",
