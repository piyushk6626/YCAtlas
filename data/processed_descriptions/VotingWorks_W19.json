    "generated_description": "### VotingWorks - A New Era of Election Integrity\n\nVotingWorks is a non-profit organization with a crucial mission: to build open-source voting machines for U.S. elections. Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator\u2019s Batch W19, VotingWorks is grounded in the belief that the system underpinning our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen\u2019s vote is sacred, and they deserve assurance that elections are conducted freely and fairly.\n\n#### The Problem with Current Voting Systems\n\nTake a moment to consider that forty U.S. states still rely on voting machines that are over a decade old. These systems are not only outdated, but they also have proprietary source codes filled with vulnerabilities that have been flagged by security experts for years. A staggering 76% of voters are worried that elections could be hacked, and when trust in the electoral process wanes, democracy itself is at risk.\n\n#### The VotingWorks Solution\n\nVotingWorks aims to change that landscape by leveraging open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and contemporary product engineering. Their approach makes elections not only safer and more accessible but also significantly more affordable. Think about the many counties across the U.S. \u2014 especially those struggling financially \u2014 that need reliable election equipment but can't afford it. Ensuring that every county can implement up-to-date technology is a crucial part of safeguarding the democratic process.\n\n#### What They Offer\n\n1. **Voting Machines**: VotingWorks is the only provider of open-source voting systems in the U.S., designed to meet the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) 2.0. This ensures that every voter can independently verify and cast their ballot securely, either on paper or through a ballot marking device.\n\n2. **Post-Election Audits**: They provide an open-source auditing tool that allows election officials to verify results by manually counting samples of paper ballots. Currently, ten states use this tool for various types of post-election audits.\n\n#### The Team\n\nBased in California, VotingWorks is a lean team of 18 dedicated professionals, guided by their Group Partner, Nan. Despite its size, the company is making significant strides in election technology, emphasizing transparency and trust.\n\n#### Why It Matters\n\nVotingWorks doesn\u2019t just build technology; they are fostering a belief that elections can be conducted with the highest levels of security and integrity. By making their systems accessible and affordable, they are ensuring that the backbone of democracy remains strong.\n\nIf you want to learn more or get involved, check out their website at [VotingWorks](https://voting.works).\n\nIn a time where election security is paramount, VotingWorks stands as a beacon of hope, proving that it's possible for technology to serve the public good and keep the foundations of democracy intact.",
