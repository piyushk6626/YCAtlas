    "generated_description": "Kingdom Supercultures is a forward-thinking company in the food-tech space that has been shaking things up since its inception in 2019. Located in New York and part of the Y Combinator Batch S20, they\u2019ve made it their mission to revolutionize food using the power of microbes. You might ask yourself, \"Microbes? Really?\" Well, they\u2019re not just any microbes\u2014they\u2019re novel microbial cultures that help food manufacturers craft innovative edible creations.\n\nTheir offerings include the world\u2019s first 0-calorie fermented sodas, unique beers bursting with new flavors, and plant-based dairy alternatives. Kingdom Supercultures specializes in what they call Superculture\u00ae ingredients\u2014an exciting new class of ingredients designed to harness natural microbes. This range is especially aimed at enhancing the food experience for companion animals, delivering functional benefits through live cultures or fermentates.\n\nNow, how does all this out-of-the-box innovation come to life? It starts with isolating tens of thousands of unique natural strains from food. With advanced automation and analytical techniques, they reassemble these microbes into Superculture blends that pack functionalities unlike anything currently available on the market. This means businesses can create next-gen products, such as lower-alcohol but full-flavor wines and yogurts that mimic the creaminess of dairy.\n\nSo far, they\u2019ve made impressive strides, raising $25 million in Series A funding to expand their suite of non-GMO microbes and partnering with high-profile eateries like Eleven Madison Park for their plant-based menu. With a small but dedicated team of eight, including Group Partner Michael Seibel from Y Combinator, Kingdom Supercultures is set up for significant growth in an ever-evolving food landscape.\n\nIf you\u2019re intrigued by the intersection of food and technology\u2014or simply want to reach a new level of taste\u2014check them out at [Kingdom Supercultures](https://kingdomsupercultures.com) and explore how their unique microbial innovations can elevate your food experiences.",
