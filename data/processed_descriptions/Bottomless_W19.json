    "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Bottomless**\n\n**What is Bottomless?**\nBottomless is a pioneering startup based in Seattle, WA, founded with the mission to create the first sensor-enabled marketplace for repeat purchases. Their unique approach leverages IoT technology to ensure that customers never have to worry about running out of their favorite products.\n\n**How Does It Work?**\nBottomless employs a smart scale that connects to your Wi-Fi, allowing it to monitor your usage of various products\u2014ranging from coffee to pet food. This scale not only tracks consumption but anticipates when you'll need more supplies, triggering automatic reorders just in time. You get a notification 8-12 hours prior to delivery, so you have full control to adjust or cancel orders if necessary. \n\n**Products Available** \nBottomless isn\u2019t limited to coffee; it offers a range of consumables like cat food, protein, snacks, and more, catering to the growing demand for subscription services that adapt to individual consumption habits. They even have a marketplace that features products from over 50 roasters, allowing users to craft personalized queues or rotation orders.\n\n**Background**\nFounded as part of Y Combinator\u2019s W19 batch, Bottomless is small but mighty with a dedicated team of just two employees. With an innovative approach to e-commerce, they are tagged under categories like \u2018marketplace\u2019, \u2018IoT\u2019, and of course, \u2018Seattle\u2019.\n\n**The Bottom Line**\nIf simplicity and smart technology speak to you, Bottomless may be your go-to for smart shopping. The concept of eliminating the guesswork in recurring purchases is not just convenient; it's a game-changer in how we stock our homes. For those constantly worried about running low on essentials, this solution could mean one less thing to think about. \n\nTo learn more about their offerings, check out their website: [Bottomless](https://bottomless.com).",
