    "generated_description": "Noya is a bold startup founded in 2020, aiming to transform the landscape of carbon capture technology. Located in San Francisco and starting as part of Y Combinator's Winter 2021 cohort, Noya's mission is straightforward yet ambitious: to radically reduce the capital costs and installation time associated with direct air capture (DAC) systems.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the idea? Noya retrofits existing industrial equipment\u2014think cooling towers\u2014transforming them into machines that suck CO2 right out of the air. This innovative approach not only makes the technology more accessible but offers a pragmatic solution to one of the climate crisis\u2019s most pressing challenges.\n\nWith a small team of just 12 employees, Noya is headed by Aaron Epstein as their Group Partner. The company emphasizes energy efficiency and modular design, seeking to deploy all-electric, water-positive direct air capture systems that could also generate clean water while tackling excess CO2.\n\nThe company has garnered attention from industry leaders, including Shopify, who see great promise in Noya\u2019s approach. Its technology stands out for being cost-effective, innovative, and aiming for carbon negativity\u2014moving beyond merely reducing emissions to actively removing carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nIn a world with increasing urgency around climate issues, Noya is inviting partnerships and collaboration to push this critical technology forward. If you care about the future of the planet and want to get involved, Noya might just be the company to watch.\n\nCheck out more about their initiatives and how they work on their [website](https://noya.co).",
