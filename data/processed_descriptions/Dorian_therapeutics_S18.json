    "generated_description": "Dorian Therapeutics is an innovative biotech company nestled in San Carlos, California, which is on a mission to tackle aging and age-related diseases. Founded in 2018 and a proud member of Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2018 batch, they\u2019re a small but ambitious team of eight.\n\nSo what\u2019s their big idea? They\u2019re pioneering a new class of therapeutics known as **senoblockers**. This cutting-edge technology aims to rejuvenate tissues by addressing one fundamental issue that underlies many diseases: aging. With roots in patented research from Stanford University, Dorian is working on a solution that has the potential to reverse the harmful effects of aging at the cellular level.\n\nThe science speaks to a pressing issue\u2014aging leads to decreased stem cell activity and an accumulation of senescent cells, which can wreak havoc on our bodies. Dorian's senoblockers target these processes, aiming to rejuvenate our biological systems by restoring cellular function and enhancing regeneration.\n\nTheir approach is direct: by understanding and manipulating the biology of aging, they believe they can not only extend lifespan but also improve the quality of life as we age. This is summed up nicely in their motto\u2014\"Younger, for longer.\"\n\nIn summary, Dorian Therapeutics is not just about slowing down the clock; they\u2019re about finding tangible treatments for age-related decline. With an ambitious vision and an impressive scientific backing, they\u2019re carving a distinctive niche in the biotech landscape.
