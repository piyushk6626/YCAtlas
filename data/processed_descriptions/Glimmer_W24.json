    "description": "Glimmer is a new way to search massive PDFs using AI.\r\n\nIf you've ever dealt with massive PDFs (i.e. over 1,000 pages), you know how broken search can be. You have no choice but to use \u201cCmd-F\u201d and manually sift through thousands of search results to find specific information. Professionals in construction, law, finance, and healthcare spend hours doing this every day.\r\n\nGlimmer makes searching these large documents 10x easier. \r\n\nWhen you upload a PDF, Glimmer uses AI to intelligently index your documents. You can then search your PDF in natural language and get answers with verifiable page sources.\r\n\nYou can get started with Glimmer for free with any kind of PDF at withglimmer.com.",

    "generated_description": "**Company Name:** Glimmer  \n**Founded:** 2023  \n**Location:** San Francisco  \n**Team Size:** 2 employees  \n**Backing:** Y Combinator (Batch W24)  \n**Website:** [withglimmer.com](https://www.withglimmer.com/)  \n\n---\n\n**Mission:**  \nGlimmer aims to revolutionize the way professionals search through massive PDFs, leveraging AI to make the process 10 times easier. \n\n**The Problem:**  \nIf you've ever dealt with PDFs that are longer than 1,000 pages\u2014think legal documents, construction reports, or lengthy financial filings\u2014you'll know that traditional search methods (like \"Cmd-F\") are woefully inadequate. Sifting through hundreds of search results to find that one critical piece of information is not only frustrating but wastes valuable time for professionals across various industries.\n\n**The Solution:**  \nGlimmer turns this tedious task into a breeze. By using advanced AI, it indexes your large PDFs intelligently. Users can upload a PDF, then search it using natural language, receiving precise answers that are linked back to their original pages. This not only saves time but also enhances the accuracy of the information retrieved.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Supports massive PDFs:** Glimmer can handle documents with over 10,000 pages.\n- **Fast search engine:** Results appear instantly as you type.\n- **Natural language processing:** Ask questions in normal language rather than syntax.\n- **Verification of sources:** Every answer includes a verifiable citation from the document, increasing trustworthiness.\n- **Robust document processing:** Identifies sections, parses tables, and optimizes search latency.\n\n**Current Focus:**  \nGlimmer's biggest expense in 2023 has been marketing and advertising, emphasizing a strategic push to grow its market presence and reach potential users who spend hours navigating through extensive PDFs.\n\n**Why It Stands Out:**  \nGlimmer is currently the only tool specifically designed for AI search on extensive files, making it a unique player in the tech landscape. It combines accuracy with user-friendly operation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with document search.\n\nIf you're ready to save hours of searching, you can [get started for free](https://www.withglimmer.com/) or try their interactive demo to see Glimmer in action.",
