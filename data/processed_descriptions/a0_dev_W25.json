Our mission is simple: we make apps with AI.\n\n**Background:**  \nFounded in 2025 and part of Y Combinator's W25 batch, a0.dev originated as a platform designed to streamline the mobile app development process. We empower developers to generate high-quality custom React Native projects in mere days instead of the weeks typically required. With a track record of launching top-ranking apps that have attracted hundreds of thousands of users, we\u2019re on a quest to build the tools that make app development even faster.\n\n**Team and Location:**  \nLocated in the heart of San Francisco, a0.dev is a lean operation with a dedicated team of two. Our group partner at Y Combinator, Michael Seibel, guides us as we navigate this exciting landscape.\n\n**Focus Areas:**  \nOur capabilities span various domains, including:\n- **Artificial Intelligence**\n- **Developer Tools**\n- **Generative AI**\n- **Design**\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we ensure that our tools not only enhance productivity but also deliver impressive user experiences.\n\n**Current Activities:**  \nWe're busy building features that allow developers to prototype React Native screens with ease. Imagine being able to create an Airbnb clone, a chess game, or an art gallery in minutes. That\u2019s the magic we\u2019re delivering.\n\n**Get In Touch:**  \nCurious to see our platform in action? Check out our website at [a0.dev](https://a0.dev). You can also join our Discord community to connect with like-minded creators.\n\nIn essence, a0.dev isn\u2019t just about making apps; it\u2019s about revolutionizing the way developers think about app creation. We\u2019re excited about what\u2019s next and invite you to be a part of the journey!",
