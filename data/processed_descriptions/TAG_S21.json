Founded in 2020 and part of the Y Combinator Batch S21, TAG aims to redefine banking by catering to the masses\u2014offering a comprehensive range of services that encompass the entire financial lives of its users. This mission is fueled by a growing trend towards digital banking solutions, and TAG is at the forefront of this transformation in Pakistan.\n\n**Location & Team**\nBased in Islamabad, TAG has assembled a team of 36 dedicated employees. This relatively small but dynamic team is looking to maximize impact in a burgeoning market that demands innovation.\n\n**Services Offered**\nTAG\u2019s offerings are diverse, targeting essential banking needs and looking to expand into advanced financial services. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re currently tackling:\n- Basic banking services, including a bank account and a Visa Debit card.\n- Employer payrolls and salary advances.\n- Future aspirations include savings accounts and neo-brokerage services, broadening the financial landscape for users.\n\n**Website and User Engagement**\nYou can explore TAG's services further on their website [tagme.pk](https://tagme.pk/), where they provide transparency in operations through a privacy policy and terms of service.

If you\u2019re interested in the future of banking, particularly how tech can democratize finance, TAG is certainly a name to watch.",
