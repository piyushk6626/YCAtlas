Based in Bengaluru, India, and currently comprising a team of 12 dedicated employees, Mantys is on a mission to simplify revenue management for businesses in the SaaS space.\n\n**Core Offering**\n\nMantys helps SaaS organizations accurately calculate and forecast their ARR without the chaos of juggling multiple spreadsheets.
