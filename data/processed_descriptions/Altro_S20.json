    "description": "Altro (altro.io) is a platform that enables members to build credit no matter who they are, where they are from, or their history of credit access/score. We serve the 68M people in the US (mainly Women and POC) who are denied credit due to historical bias and the lack of access that current banks provide to credit building and tools. (It wasn't until The Equal Credit Opportunity Act in the 1970's that Women and \"Minorities\" could even get fair access to credit)!\r\n\nAltro has created a mobile that allows anyone to have access to credit, using their subscriptions as a means to start building their credit score. Altro lends to members a $75 Line of Credit to pay for their subscriptions, such as Netflix, Hulu, HelloFresh, etc. This card is built to solely work on the subscriptions that the member is already paying for, allowing them to securely use their $75 credit to build their credit using things they are already paying for.\r\n\nDoing this empowers folx who were denied credit a way to start building their score and financial power. Altro will service millions of people in not only building their credit, but also gaining access to the tools (such as personal loans, emergency funds, car/house loans and more) that they could not access prior.",

    "generated_description": "Altro is a fintech startup on a mission to \u201cBuild Credit With Your Subscriptions.\u201d Founded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S20, this Los Angeles-based company is tackling one of the most significant issues in the credit industry: access. \n\nWith 68 million people in the U.S. struggling to gain fair credit access\u2014many of whom are women and people of color\u2014Altro aims to bridge that gap. Historically, credit opportunities have been limited by bias, a legacy that continues. It wasn't until the 1970s, with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, that these groups even began to see fair treatment. \n\nAltro\u2019s innovative platform allows members to leverage everyday subscriptions\u2014think services like Netflix, Hulu, and HelloFresh\u2014as a means of building their credit scores. By providing a $75 line of credit that\u2019s exclusively used for these subscriptions, Altro enables users to turn their monthly expenses into a tool for credit-building. This means that customers can start to establish a credit history without jumping through traditional financial hurdles.\n\nThe app isn\u2019t just about the quick fix; it\u2019s about empowerment. By using Altro, members not only work toward a better credit score but also gain access to traditional financial tools like personal loans and mortgages that were previously inaccessible. It's a fresh approach in an industry dominated by outdated practices.\n\nAltro\u2019s team consists of 29 people dedicated to this vision, and they actively engage with their community through podcasts and educational events aimed at increasing financial literacy. \n\nIn a nutshell, Altro is reshaping how individuals interact with credit by making it more inclusive and easier to obtain\u2014making every payment count towards a brighter financial future.
