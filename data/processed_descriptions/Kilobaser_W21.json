    "generated_description": "**Kilobaser Overview**\n\n**Founded:** 2014  \n**Location:** Graz, Austria  \n**Team Size:** 10 Employees  \n**Y Combinator Batch:** W21  \n**Website:** [Kilobaser](https://www.kilobaser.com)\n\n---\n\n**Mission & Vision**  \nKilobaser is on a clear mission to democratize access to DNA synthesis with its innovative product: the **Kilobaser One-XT**, the first microfluidic chip and cartridge-based personal DNA and RNA synthesizer. This device aims to revolutionize laboratory practices by allowing life scientists to synthesize custom DNA right at their benchtops\u2014no more waiting for outsourced services. Think of it as the **Nespresso Machine for DNA**. \n\n**The Problem**  \nTraditionally, researchers faced long delays and inflated costs when outsourcing DNA synthesis. This bottleneck has stifled innovation in life sciences. Kilobaser aims to empower researchers by putting the power of DNA synthesis in their hands, significantly speeding up the research process.\n\n**Product Offerings**  \nKilobaser\u2019s main product is the **Kilobaser One-XT**, which enables users to create custom DNA and RNA on-demand quickly, efficiently, and independently. They also offer a variety of cartridges for different applications, including **sample oligos** and **multi-rack systems** for larger production needs.\n\n**Use Cases & Impact**  \nUsers are finding various applications for the Kilobaser synthesizers. From supporting PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 to assisting in molecular cloning, this technology unlocks possibilities that were previously confined to larger labs with more resources.\n\n**Customer Experiences**  \nTestimonials from researchers indicate that Kilobaser is a game-changer. Users appreciate the ease of operation and the quick delivery of results. For instance, Tam Yew Joon, CSO of Biogenes Technologies, calls it a \"game-changer\" in the world of oligo synthesis.\n\n**Technical Edge**  \nKilobaser's technology combines microfluidic precision with the simplicity of a cartridge system. This unique approach not only lowers the barrier to entry for DNA synthesis in research but also promises higher efficiency in producing oligonucleotides.\n\n**Market Positioning**  \nKilobaser operates in the niche of hard-tech hardware and medical devices, focusing on life sciences. This positioning allows them to tap into a market that is rapidly embracing in-house solutions for DNA and RNA synthesis.\n\n**Engagement Opportunities**  \nFor those interested in exploring Kilobaser's offerings, the company provides opportunities for live demonstrations to truly understand the simplicity and impact of their technology. You can also order sample oligos and book online demos through their website.\n\n---\n\nIn a nutshell, Kilobaser is not just selling a product; they are enabling a new paradigm in DNA synthesis that empowers researchers to experiment, innovate, and accelerate breakthroughs\u2014right from their own labs. If you're involved in life sciences and want to upgrade your capabilities, you\u2019ll definitely want to keep an eye on Kilobaser.",
