But for those who want to have their money managed, they must turn to high fee, high minimum advisors (e.g., RIAs like Edward Jones). With LLMs, we can now offer personalized wealth management to many more people, more cheaply and with faster service. Our goal is to grow their wealth more than they'd do on their own.",
