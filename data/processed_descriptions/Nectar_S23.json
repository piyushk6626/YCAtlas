Over 50,000 companies today are required to collect utility data for upcoming regulations in the US/EU. Sustainability teams manually parse the data, a process that takes 100M work hours annually, requires expensive audits, and results in inaccurate metrics. Nectar automatically extracts, structures, and inputs this data into companies' existing systems.",

    "generated_description": "**Company Overview: Nectar**\n\n**Mission:** Nectar aims to simplify the process of collecting carbon emissions data for large companies, helping them comply with mandatory disclosure regulations.\n\n**Background:** Founded in 2022 and part of Y Combinator Batch S23, Nectar is based in San Francisco. The company was established in response to an overwhelming challenge facing over 50,000 companies in the U.S. and EU, who need to gather utility data for sustainability reporting.
