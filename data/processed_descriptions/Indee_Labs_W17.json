    "generated_description": "**Indee Labs: Innovating T Cell Immunotherapy**\n\nFounded in 2015 and based in Berkeley, CA, Indee Labs is a biotech company on a mission to revolutionize T cell immunotherapy. As part of the Y Combinator Batch W17, they have charged ahead to tackle one of the largest hurdles in the field: intracellular delivery. Most traditional methods struggle with efficiency and cell viability, and that's where Indee Labs' patented technology comes into play.\n\n### **The Technology**\n\nIndee Labs specializes in a non-viral delivery system known as Hydropore\u2122, which utilizes **microfluidic vortex shedding** (_\u00b5VS_). This innovative approach allows for the rapid delivery of nucleic acids, proteins, and gene-editing complexes directly to patient and donor T cells\u2014doing so with minimal disruption. Picture it like an express lane for cellular therapies, where you can yield millions to billions of healthy, functional cells in mere seconds.\n\nThis technology significantly circumvents the limitations seen with viral transduction and traditional electroporation methods, providing a more efficient path from research and development through to large-scale manufacturing.\n\n### **Current Activities**\n\nThe compact team of five at Indee Labs is currently focused on several exciting initiatives, including partnerships and ongoing development for their Hydropore\u2122 system. They\u2019ve recently secured strategic investments, collaborated with companies like GenScript and Monomer Bio to enhance their offerings, and adopted cutting-edge tools like Scispot to streamline their operations.\n\nNotable recent announcements include an exclusive distribution deal with Sunko Instruments in China for Hydropore\u2122, showcasing their commitment to expanding their global reach. \n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Founded**: 2015  \n- **Location**: Berkeley, CA  \n- **Team Size**: 5 employees  \n- **Specialization**: Non-viral delivery systems for T cell immunotherapy  \n- **Technological Edge**: Hydropore\u2122 utilizing microfluidic vortex shedding  \n- **Partnerships**: Collaborations with major biotech entities to enhance research and development capabilities  \n\nIndee Labs represents an exciting beacon of innovation in gene and cell therapy, driving forward with the promise of better, more effective treatments for various diseases through engineered T cell therapies.
