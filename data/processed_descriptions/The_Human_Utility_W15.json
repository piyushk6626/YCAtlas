In order to afford utilities, families often forgo medication, food, and transportation. The Human Utility's platform divides a bill similar to a loan syndicate expanding the possible number of donors from around the world able to join together to ensure families never lose access to utility service. Donors are matched with a specific family or donate to a universal assistance fund.\r\n\nLater, we use utility data to design interventions addressing the root causes of why people need help with their utility bills with the goal of never having them lose service again.",
