Our AI assistant takes a comprehensive medical history using an empathic voice-based interface, uses sophisticated medical reasoning to narrow down likely diagnoses, and produces evidence-based treatment suggestions for each patient. Licensed doctors then review the text-based summaries of the cases our AI provides, and choose how to manage the patients. In this fashion, we're able to deliver end-to-end healthcare where AI manages 99%, and doctors do the final high value 1%.",

They operate with a structure that's 99% AI and just 1% doctor, streamlining the healthcare delivery model so physicians can focus on high-value care while technology handles the routine tasks.\n\n#### How It Works\nOpenClinic provides a digital platform that allows any medical professional or institution to launch their own virtual clinic. The AI assistant conducts initial consultations by collecting detailed medical histories using a voice-based, empathetic interface. It evaluates symptoms and suggests likely diagnoses, while licensed doctors review AI-generated summaries to make informed decisions about patient care. \n\nThis unique blend enables doctors to see more patients efficiently\u2014just imagine cutting the tedious paperwork down to a page or two, while providing better care based on evidence-based treatment suggestions.\n\n#### Benefits\n1. **Empathy at Scale:** The AI doesn't just take notes; it engages patients in natural conversations, making history-taking feel more personal and less mechanical.\n2. **Safety Checks:** Safety is paramount at OpenClinic. Their system includes several checkpoints to ensure that cases are suitable for virtual care before being routed to physicians. \n3. **Faster Payments:** Transactions are simplified: doctors receive payments immediately for their services, allowing them to focus entirely on patient care.\n4. **Support from Doctors:** Three of the four co-founders are practicing medical doctors. This insider expertise means that OpenClinic isn't just tech for tech's sake; it's designed with real doctor needs in mind.\n\n#### The Team\nOpenClinic is led by a small but skilled team, with David Lieb serving as the Group Partner. Their collective experience numbers over 10,000 patient interactions, which directly informs the product's design.\n\n#### Conclusion\nOpenClinic is not just another health-tech startup; it\u2019s a rethinking of how healthcare can be delivered in the digital age. By minimizing the administrative load through AI, they enable doctors to reclaim their time and joy in practice. If you\u2019re looking for a way to start or streamline a digital clinic, OpenClinic stands eager to help.\n\nFor more information, visit [OpenClinic](https://www.openclinic.com) and see how you can join the future of healthcare.",
