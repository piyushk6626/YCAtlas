    "description": "Getting clothes tailor-made is very common in India, especially for women. Saree blouses have to be tailor-made always due to their fitted nature & the non-stretchiness of typical Indian fabrics. \r\n\nThe tailoring market however, hasn't evolved at all. It is highly fragmented with a low NPS. The end user experience demands a significant amount of the customer's time, involving visits to a physical shop & avoidable back & forth. This is increasingly unviable for busy urban Indian women. We make it super easy by letting women place an order online, get fitted at the comfort of their homes, help them with styling their fabric & deliver the made-to-measure clothes directly to their doorstep.",
