To unleash the potential of open-source humanoid robots capable of tackling all those boring and tedious tasks that fill our days. \n\nWith a team of just ten dedicated employees, K-Scale Labs is ambitiously designing robots that can walk, talk, and interact with their environment \u2014 all based on an open-source framework that they\u2019re eager to share with the world. By democratizing access to their technology, they aim not just to innovate, but to inspire a larger movement in robotics.\n\nThe company is skillfully navigating intersections in machine learning, AI, and consumer robotics. They\u2019re tagged in several key areas: 'machine-learning', 'robotics', 'consumer', 'ai', and they\u2019re rooted in the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area. Harj Taggar, their Group Partner, is providing invaluable guidance as they push the boundaries of what humanoid robots can achieve.\n\nFor more information or to explore their work, check out their website at [K-Scale Labs](https://kscale.dev/).
