The company has a concise but profound mission: to eliminate compulsive phone usage\u2014one of the biggest distractions in our modern lives. \n\nImagine a tool that helps align how you actually spend your time with your best intentions. That's where Clearspace comes in. They describe themselves as the \"intentionality layer\" for your digital experience, aiming to retrain users to resist mindless scrolling and engage meaningfully with their devices.\n\nThe team, consisting of only five employees, is spearheaded by Jared Friedman as their Group Partner. Their innovative approach involves essential features such as session timers, app-specific usage limits, and data insights to help users track their progress over time.\n\nHow does it work? Users are encouraged to complete a centering exercise before diving into an app, setting boundaries to prevent getting lost in the digital abyss. Clearspace pulls them out when their designated time is up, effectively combating digital distractions. The platform also provides insights into app usage patterns, helping users redesign their digital lives and focus on what truly matters.\n\nYou can check out their offerings at [getclearspace.com](https://getclearspace.com), where you\u2019ll find more details about the product, its features, and how it seeks to instill healthier phone habits. In a world where our devices often control us rather than vice versa, Clearspace is making a compelling case for intentional technology usage.",
