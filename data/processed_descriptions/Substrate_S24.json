The onboarding process is as easy as inviting a new employee\u2014simply provide the login credentials, and their AI agents will navigate any EMR or portal with ease.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nHealthcare billing is notoriously tedious and fraught with challenges. Substrate steps in at a critical junction, addressing these pain points with intelligent solutions. From verifying patient eligibility to managing complex denials, they aim to redefine what\u2019s possible in medical billing.\n\nThe potential for savings and efficiency in a sector that cannot afford errors is substantial.
