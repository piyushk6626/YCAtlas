This strategic move enhances the value proposition for its users by providing a more comprehensive account experience. Users can easily transition from Z1 to NG.CASH, carrying over their funds in just a few taps.\n\n### Team and Vision\nWith a growing team of 80, led by Group Partner **Aaron Epstein**, Z1 is committed to expanding its offerings and improving user experience.
