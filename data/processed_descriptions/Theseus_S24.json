    "generated_description": "Theseus, founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch S24, is tackling a significant challenge in the drone industry: **GPS-denied navigation**. Located in [location needed], this nimble team of three is developing a cutting-edge Micro Visual Positioning System (VPS) designed to enable drones to navigate effectively in environments where GPS signals can\u2019t be relied on\u2014think deserts, forests, and anywhere else that might interfere with traditional navigation systems.\n\nTheir VPS leverages a combination of cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and reference satellite imagery to provide precise positioning. What's impressive about this system is that it\u2019s entirely self-contained, resilient against jamming, and carries no RF signature. This means drones outfitted with the Theseus VPS can operate seamlessly, without the risk of being disrupted by Electronic Warfare threats.\n\nThe technology\u2019s plug-and-play feature is a game changer. It can be retrofitted onto any Group 1+ drone in under 30 minutes, meaning operators can complete missions that were once deemed impossible due to GPS limitations. The Micro VPS provides consistent positional accuracy over any flight duration, making it an ideal solution for critical missions\u2014no matter the terrain or environmental conditions.\n\nSafety and reliability are at the forefront of Theseus's mission. They aim to revolutionize how intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions are conducted in GPS-denied environments. With endorsements from military personnel like Lt. Col. USAF and Capt. USSOCOM, it's clear that the benefits of their technology are being recognized at the highest levels.\n\nIn a world increasingly reliant on GPS, Theseus stands out as a forward-thinking player ready to redefine drone navigation.
