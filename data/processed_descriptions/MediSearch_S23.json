    "generated_description": "**MediSearch: A Beacon of Trustworthy Medical Information**\n\nFounded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator\u2019s Batch S23, MediSearch is on a mission to be your reliable search engine for medical inquiries. Based in London, UK, this dynamic startup is a compact team of four, driven by the belief that everyone deserves access to trustworthy health information.\n\nMediSearch was born from the need for direct, science-based answers to pressing medical questions. It utilizes artificial intelligence and generative AI technologies to sift through vast amounts of data and provide clear, concise responses drawn from credible sources. Whether you\u2019re curious about the benefits of coffee or the potential side effects of vaccines, MediSearch aims to deliver evidence-based insights.\n\nTheir web platform offers an array of features, including the ability to filter both common and complex medical queries. For example, users can explore questions like \u201cDoes sport increase life expectancy?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the probability of blood clots after surgery?\u201d with just a few clicks. \n\nMediSearch is particularly relevant today, as misinformation in healthcare can have serious consequences. The company maintains that while their tool is an excellent resource for information, it doesn\u2019t replace professional medical advice. \n\nYou can find them online at [medisearch.io](https://medisearch.io), where they also provide an app for on-the-go access to trustworthy health information. The company is tagged under several categories, including artificial intelligence, consumer health services, and digital health, underscoring their innovative approach to healthcare solutions. \n\nIn summary, MediSearch is setting out to empower users with reliable medical knowledge, striving to enhance the way individuals seek answers in healthcare. If you're looking for clarity in a world awash with conflicting health information, MediSearch could just be what you need.",
