    "description": "Sieve is a specialized cloud built for video / audio AI.\r\n\nEvery video product today is being overwhelmed by a ton of new use cases that are enabled by AI. Video is unique in that it\u2019s much more compute and data-intensive to process or generate compared to other modalities. This leads to a ton of complexity around the ways models are run, the kinds of extra processing needed to happen around them, and the complexity of pipelines that solve the most valuable use cases in the modality. To this end, Sieve\u2019s strongest and most immediate value proposition comes from being an AI toolkit that solves problems unique to video \u2014 unlike generic AI developer tools that might exist today.\r\n\nVideo is just the start however.
