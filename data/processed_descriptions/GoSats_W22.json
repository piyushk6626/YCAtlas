Its mission? To help Indian shoppers earn free Bitcoin through cashback and rewards every time they make a purchase. The concept is straightforward: each time you shop, you accumulate Bitcoin rewards, creating a new way to view your spending as investing.\n\n**What They Do**: Think of GoSats as a hybrid between a shopping rewards app and an investment tool. Users earn cashback in the form of Bitcoin or Gold every time they swipe their GoSats card. Collaborating with over 100 leading brands, including Myntra, BigBasket, and Zomato, GoSats offers enticing rewards ranging from 1.5% to an impressive 22.95%. You can also purchase gift cards from top brands and earn up to 20% in Bitcoin or Gold.\n\n**Features**:\n- **Cashback Rewards**: Get 1.5% cashback on regular purchases and up to 20% on selected gift cards.\n- **SatsPay**: A unique feature allowing users to scan and pay with earned rewards instantly, enhancing the spending experience.\n- **Marketplace Integration**: Seamlessly shop online or in-store at partnered merchants to rack up Bitcoin rewards.\n\n**Company Size and Leadership**: With a compact yet agile team of 8, GoSats benefits from leadership under Harj Taggar, a partner at Y Combinator. This mentorship kick-starts their development and amplifies their reach in the booming Bitcoin rewards sector.\n\n**Community Trust**: Trusted by over 500,000 users, GoSats has cultivated a credible reputation for transforming everyday spending into valuable asset accumulation. Their design ethos is not just to offer rewards but to integrate the idea of investing into shopping behavior, effectively changing the narrative around consumer spending.\n\n**Getting Started**: For anyone looking to dive into the world of Bitcoin while indulging in their shopping habits, GoSats has made it easy with their intuitive app available on both iOS and Android. The company's website, [GoSats](https://gosats.io), outlines everything from how to get started to FAQs about rewards and withdrawals.\n\nIn sum, GoSats isn't just another cashback app; it\u2019s an innovative approach to retail that combines shopping, saving, and investing in a very non-traditional way. They\u2019re reimagining how we earn and perceive value in our financial lives, one purchase at a time.
