Based in San Francisco, this lean team of four is driven by a singular mission: to become the Microsoft or OpenAI of the automotive sector.\n\n### The Vision\n\nToma aims to leverage AI to transform the way automotive dealerships operate, tapping into an industry that's essentially a sleeping giant, contributing trillions to the GDP. Their plan? Start with a world-class voice AI solution that enhances all aspects of dealership operations\u2014from service to sales, and beyond. Currently, Toma\u2019s voice agents handle thousands of calls daily, generating millions in revenue for their clients. Think of them as digital assistants that seamlessly integrate into the existing workflows of dealerships, making processes easier and more efficient.\n\n### Strategic Partnerships and Backing\n\nToma has positioned itself alongside heavyweight players in the industry, including Car Dealership Guy and big public companies like Lithia Motors and Cox Automotive. Their technology isn\u2019t just innovative; it\u2019s backed by some of the best investors in Silicon Valley, which is crucial for credibility and growth.\n\n### Features and Capabilities\n\nWhat sets Toma apart is its robust, customizable AI suite that includes:\n\n- **Voice AI for All Departments**: Whether it\u2019s service booking, sales inquiries, or financing questions, Toma\u2019s technology is designed to cover it all, enhancing customer experience while saving precious time.\n  \n- **Natural and Multilingual Communication**: Toma\u2019s voice agents are designed to sound human-like, complete with the ability to converse in over 30 languages. This is crucial in a diverse marketplace.\n\n- **Integrated Workflows**: Toma can connect with popular dealership management software and scheduling tools, minimizing disruption while maximizing efficiency.\n\n- **Self-Improving AI**: As Toma gathers data from interactions, it learns what works best, continually improving its responses and effectiveness.\n\n### The Early Impact\n\nFeedback from early adopters reveals remarkable results. For instance, one dealership reported saving around 43 hours per month in staff time, allowing their team to focus more on in-person engagements. Another dealership credits Toma with generating over $20,000 in additional monthly revenue.\n\n### The Takeaway\n\nToma is not just another tech startup; it represents a significant step forward in an industry that\u2019s ripe for disruption. As the automotive sector embraces AI, Toma is positioned to lead the charge, helping dealerships unlock new levels of efficiency and revenue generation.
