The platform is already making waves, with videos created on Eggnog racking up 100,000 views on Twitter shortly after launch\u2014a promising indicator of its potential.\n\nEggnog offers several engaging experiences, such as:\n\n- **Time Portal**: A game that challenges users to travel through time and guess their location.\n- **Remix**: A feature that allows users to remix clips from movies and TV shows.\n- **Editor**: An AI-driven video editing tool.\n- **Infinite**: A unique option to watch an endless stream of TV content.\n\nUnder the mentorship of Group Partner Harj Taggar, Eggnog is tagged with essential themes like artificial intelligence, entertainment, social media, and video.
