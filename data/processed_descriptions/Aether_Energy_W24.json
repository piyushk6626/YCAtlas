More than half of the cost of a rooftop solar project comes from soft costs. We started Aether with the sole aim of reducing solar soft costs. \r\n\nOur vision: Aether will be a big player in the young and emerging Solar software vertical, which has a projected 20B Global TAM up for grabs by 2025.",
