We use special-purpose deep-learning models instead of using textual / semantic similarity to evaluate how good a search result is.\r\n\nThis enables us to actually reason how well search results match the intent of the search query, eliminating the problems that come from evaluating search results on how much they look like the search query.",

    "generated_description": "Artemis Search is shaking things up in the world of search technology. Founded in 2021 and a proud member of Y Combinator\u2019s Batch S22, this San Francisco-based startup has a mission that\u2019s refreshingly straightforward: to create a search technology that actually finds what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nWhile most search engines rely heavily on textual or semantic similarity to rank results, Artemis Search goes a step further. It employs special-purpose deep-learning models designed to evaluate how well search results align with the intent behind your queries. This innovative approach means that Artemis can not only return results that look similar to what you asked for but actually make sense in the context of your intent.\n\nCurrently, the company operates with a small but mighty team of three, led by Group Partner Dalton Caldwell. Artemis is tagged in the bustling sectors of artificial intelligence, machine learning, SaaS, B2B, and, of course, search. They are currently in beta and are focused on developing an AI-powered prospecting tool that combs the internet to identify ideal customers for businesses.\n\nIf you're curious to see what Artemis Search is all about, you can check out their website at [search-artemis.com](https://search-artemis.com/). Whether you're a business looking for smarter search solutions or someone interested in cutting-edge AI technologies, Artemis is a company to keep on your radar. They\u2019re tackling one of the most persistent problems in tech \u2014 making search actually work. The future of search could be a lot brighter thanks to them.",
