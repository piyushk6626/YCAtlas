    "generated_description": "**Hatchways: Redefining the Engineering Interview Experience**\n\nFounded in 2018 and a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch S19, Hatchways is a Toronto-based company on a mission: to make engineering interviews feel more like real work. The traditional tech interview often fails to reflect the actual skills and challenges of software development. Hatchways aims to change that.\n\n### What They Do\n\nHatchways began by developing customizable, GitHub-based technical assessments. These allow candidates to demonstrate their skills through tasks that mimic real-world work scenarios, such as **reviewing code**, **submitting pull requests**, and **designing systems**. This practical approach not only assesses technical ability but also enhances the overall hiring process by providing more accurate signals about a candidate\u2019s capabilities.\n\nThe Hatchways platform emphasizes a streamlined and user-friendly interview process that caters to specific job roles, making the experience more equitable and effective for both candidates and employers.\n\n### Features\n\n- **Real-World Tasks**: Instead of abstract algorithms, candidates face tasks relevant to the job they are applying for. This includes options like bug fixes, feature additions, and code reviews.\n\n- **Easy Assessment Building**: Create assessments using their templates or customize your own. The system supports various programming languages and integrates well with existing workflows.\n\n- **Data-Driven Insights**: Hatchways leverages data and industry expertise to help companies design effective assessments that predict on-the-job performance.\n\n- **Integration with ATS**: The platform can seamlessly integrate with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) like Lever, Greenhouse, and Ashby, ensuring recruitment teams can directly manage candidate assessments within their existing systems.\n\n### Team and Growth\n\nHatchways is a small team of eight but is ambitious and innovative. They currently focus on building a strong community of users and partners, which includes notable names like Plaid and AcuityMD, who praise Hatchways for improving candidate experience and assessment relevance.\n\n### Why Choose Hatchways?\n\nHatchways stands out in the crowded landscape of tech recruitment platforms by prioritizing the candidate experience. Testimonials highlight the engaging nature of their assessments, with many candidates expressing a preference for real work challenges over outdated theory questions. \n\nBy offering a lower-stress environment and allowing candidates to compete on relevancy rather than rote memorization, Hatchways is increasingly recognized as a go-to solution for tech hiring.\n\nIf you're interested in experimenting with their platform, you can get started at [Hatchways](http://www.hatchways.io).\n\nOverall, Hatchways is not just an innovative company; it's a fresh approach to evaluating technical talent in a manner that aligns closely with how that talent will actually perform on the job.",
