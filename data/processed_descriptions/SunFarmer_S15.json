    "generated_description": "SunFarmer is on a mission to bring reliable and affordable solar energy to developing countries\u2014an ambition that sits at the intersection of sustainability and social impact. Founded in 2015, as part of the Y Combinator Batch S15, the company is based in Kathmandu, Nepal, and is tackling one of the pressing challenges of our time: access to electricity. \n\nIn many regions, particularly in developing countries, electricity is often scarce, unreliable, or exorbitantly priced. This lack of energy access affects critical areas such as healthcare, education, economic development, and agriculture. In fact, 1.2 billion people worldwide are without electricity, and Nepal alone sees 26% of its population relying on traditional energy sources.\n\nSunFarmer aims to change this by providing solar energy solutions specifically designed for hospitals, schools, businesses, and farms. The organization has achieved impressive outcomes, having pumped over 34 million cubic meters of water, produced more than 12 million units of clean electricity, and offset about 13.4 million kilograms of CO2. \n\nThe SunFarmer team, comprised of 15 dedicated employees, is passionate about crafting solar energy systems that not only meet the immediate energy needs of communities but also foster long-term environmental benefits. They offer services that allow local entities to \"Get Solar\" and even \"Give Solar,\" thus engaging a broader community in their mission.\n\nFor those keen on getting involved or learning more, visit [SunFarmer](http://sunfarmer.org). It\u2019s clear: they\u2019re not just lighting up buildings; they\u2019re illuminating the path toward a sustainable future for communities that need it the most.",
