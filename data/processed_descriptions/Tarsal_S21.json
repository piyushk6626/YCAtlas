Security teams using Tarsal report significant improvements in operational efficiency and threat detection capabilities. Clients like Robinhood and Navan have experienced a drastic reduction in data pipeline development time\u2014from weeks to mere minutes\u2014allowing them to allocate resources towards actual security improvements instead of getting bogged down by data grunt work.\n\n**Why Tarsal?**\n\n- **Future-Proof:** Scales with your organization as data needs grow.\n- **No Vendor Lock-In:** Flexibility to choose where and how you send data.\n- **Affordable Solutions:** Helps reduce costs associated with storage and analytics by allowing you to offload data into lakes.\n- **No-Code Convenience:** Facilitates connections without the need for complex coding.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTarsal is at the forefront of making security data management less of a headache and more of a streamlined operation.
