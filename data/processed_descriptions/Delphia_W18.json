With a team of about 20 employees led by seasoned professionals, including CIO Jonathan Briggs, they're continually innovating. The firm has exciting plans, including:\n- **Tilt**: A new platform for trend-based investments.\n- **Backchannel**: A venture enabling experts to monetize their knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, Delphia has recently shifted its focus to professional investors after refining its core offerings.\n\n### Why Delphia Matters\nIn a world where your data is often considered a commodity, Delphia is pioneering a new path.
