At its core, the company has developed a groundbreaking handheld imaging device specifically designed to help doctors determine the most effective treatments for breast cancer patients. This innovation can potentially spare patients from the grueling experience of ineffective therapies and their associated side effects.\n\nNearWave\u2019s mission is clear: assist healthcare providers in selecting the right therapies at the right time, ultimately improving the quality of care for those facing a challenging diagnosis. The company is a proud participant of Y Combinator Batch W22, gathering traction and support in the startup ecosystem.\n\nThe heart of NearWave\u2019s technology is its Frequency Domain Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fdNIRS). This non-invasive approach allows for detailed measurements of key tissue biomarkers, such as oxygen saturation and hemoglobin levels\u2014critical factors in assessing the best treatment modalities. The NearWave Scanner stands out as the world's smallest, most efficient fdNIRS device, integrating over 30 years of diffuse optics science into a user-friendly format.\n\nWith a dedicated team of just three, NearWave is taking strategic steps to forge partnerships with universities and hospitals nationwide, leveraging their technology in clinical settings. The website, [NearWave.co](http://nearwave.co), serves as a hub for technology insights, company updates, and research applications, inviting potential collaborators and clients to engage with their mission. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the intersection of health and technology, or simply want to learn more about how NearWave is changing lives through innovation, be sure to check them out.
