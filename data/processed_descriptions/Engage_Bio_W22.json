Our founders have deep experience in immunotherapy development, including four drugs in the clinic, and in building mRNA therapeutics platforms. Our approach is to provide cancer cells with instructions to make and gradually release our drugs within solid tumors. This local therapy allows us to eliminate tumors while sparing healthy distant tissues.",

    "generated_description": "**Engage Bio: Revolutionizing Cancer Treatment with mRNA Immunotherapies**\n\nFounded in 2021, Engage Bio is on a mission to combat cancer using innovative mRNA immunotherapies. Based in Santa Clara, CA, and part of the Y Combinator Batch W22, the company's team of five is harnessing their extensive experience in immunotherapy, which includes four drugs currently in clinical trials.\n\nEngage Bio\u2019s unique approach revolves around their creation of \u201cTethosomes\u201d\u2014a new class of non-viral DNA delivery systems designed to enable potent, durable, and scalable genetic medicine. Their platform directly addresses the traditional challenges of mRNA therapeutic development, such as potency and toxicity. By using lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology, Engage Bio effectively delivers therapeutic DNA along with mRNA that encodes their proprietary Tethosome protein. This protein ensures that the therapeutic DNA is localized to the nucleus, dramatically increasing expression levels by over 100 times while remaining invisible to the immune system.\n\nThe core idea? Instead of simply treating cancer, Engage Bio provides cancer cells with the instructions to produce and release their own therapeutic agents directly within the tumor environment. This targeted delivery aims to eradicate tumors more effectively while minimizing collateral damage to healthy tissue.\n\nThe leadership team includes co-founders Will Olsen (CEO) and Kathryn Kwant (CSO), along with other key scientists with impressive backgrounds in biomedicine. Notably, they are focusing on building partnerships in areas such as oncology, gene replacement, and therapeutic protein expression to broaden the application of their Tethosome technology.\n\nWith a clear vision and a sophisticated technology platform, Engage Bio stands out as a promising contender in the biotech landscape, targeting one of humanity's most pressing challenges\u2014cancer. \n\nFor more information about their innovative work and potential career opportunities, visit [Engage Bio's website](http://engagebio.com).\n\n### Key Info:\n- **Founded**: 2021\n- **Location**: Santa Clara, CA\n- **Team Size**: 5 employees\n- **Partnership**: Y Combinator Batch W22\n- **Technology**: Tethosome platform for non-viral DNA delivery\n- **Website**: [engagebio.com](http://engagebio.com) \n\nEngage Bio represents the intersection of passion for patient care and cutting-edge science, aiming to redefine how we approach cancer treatment in the coming years.",
