It has Tom Blomfield as a Group Partner, bringing additional weight to its advisory board with his experience in tech and entrepreneurship.\n\n### Features and Offerings\n\nIntryc's offerings are robust and designed to cater to various roles within customer support:\n\n1. **Quality Assurance**: The core focus of Intryc is to provide comprehensive QA tools that allow customer support leads and teams to ensure consistent service quality.\n   \n2. **Real-Time Insights**: The platform enables businesses to monitor important incidents on calls and gain in-depth insights into all activities.\n\n3. **Role-Based Solutions**: \n   - **CS Quality Assurance Lead**: Sets service standards and monitors team performance.\n   - **Support Agent**: Works to enhance customer interactions, turning them into moments of trust.\n   - **QA Specialist**: Focuses on training and providing high-quality support.\n   - **Support Agent Team Lead**: Ensures that the team meets and exceeds customer expectations consistently.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **AI-Powered Evaluations**: Breaks through the limitations of manual sampling and enables full ticket coverage.\n- **Customizable Scorecards**: Allows businesses to define their own rules for quality evaluations, ensuring relevancy and effectiveness.\n- **Proactive Insights**: Offers alerts and real-time data analysis to identify trends and issues before they escalate.\n\nThese features collectively position Intryc as a leader in the automation of customer support QA, making it easier for companies to improve service and reduce operational burdens.\n\n### Testimonials and Impact\n\nIntryc is already gaining traction, with partners like Deel attesting to impressive results such as a 40% increase in audit output and significant improvements in continuous insights.
