    "description": "At Undermind, we're building a search engine that can handle extremely complex questions. It\u2019s geared at experts, like research scientists and doctors, who need to find very specific resources to solve high-stakes problems. \r\n\nWe\u2019ve rebuilt search from the ground up to address this. Our new approach employs high-quality LLMs to adaptively explore a database, mimicking how a human researcher carefully discovers information. This approach dramatically outperforms (by 10-50x) traditional keyword search and other modern AI-based retrieval methods.\r\n\nOur first target users are the 50 million researchers searching for scientific literature on PubMed and Google Scholar every month. We\u2019ve have users paying us $200-$500 per seat per year, from fields like medicine, ML, biotech, finance, and more.",
