The brainchild of Mathias and Philip, both seasoned entrepreneurs with prior startup experience, AccessOwl addresses a growing need for effective access management in a world where remote work and SaaS solutions are proliferating.\n\n### Mission\nThe mission of AccessOwl is simple: to manage and automate employee access to various SaaS platforms. Initially designed to streamline the provisioning and permissioning of employee accounts, it helps IT teams reduce the average time spent on access requests by 30 minutes per request. This efficiency is crucial as the lines blur between startups and enterprises regarding access management challenges, particularly for organizations pursuing SOC2 certifications.\n\n### The Founders\nMathias and Philip bring a wealth of experience to AccessOwl. Philip previously served as CEO and Co-Founder of Blik, an IoT solution recognized by major players like Volkswagen and BMW. Mathias has a rich background as the Co-Founder and CTO of a leading private payment infrastructure provider in Germany and launched the country\u2019s first digital car insurance. Their collective experiences highlighted the recurring issues in access management that they sought to resolve with AccessOwl.\n\n### Product Overview\nDeploying AccessOwl is a breeze \u2014 IT can get it up and running in minutes simply by adding a Slack application. The platform supports a range of features including automated user provisioning, access request handling via Slack, vendor management, and SaaS spend management. It eliminates the need for complex integrations like SCIM or SAML, cutting down the time and complexity often associated with identity governance. \n\nCore functionalities include:\n- **Shadow IT Discovery**: Identify every application used within the organization.\n- **Access Reviews**: Conduct reviews in minutes instead of weeks.\n- **Automated Provisioning**: Streamline user onboarding and offboarding processes.\n- **Requests & Approvals**: Facilitate direct access requests and approvals via Slack.\n- **Vendor Management**: Centralize all vendor interactions.\n- **SaaS Spend Management**: Monitor and optimize software expenditure.\n\nThe promise here is saving companies considerable amounts of time and reducing the friction often found in access management workflows.\n\n### Team and Partnerships\nWith a lean team of four and backing from Y Combinator, AccessOwl is also under the guidance of Group Partner Dalton Caldwell, a notable name in the startup ecosystem. \n\n### Conclusion\nAccessOwl is positioned to be a game-changer in the SaaS access management space, providing essential tools to manage apps, user access, and compliance efficiently. As the landscape of digital business evolves, companies like AccessOwl will be instrumental in helping organizations navigate the complexities of digital security and user management. \n\nTo learn more or get started, visit [AccessOwl's website](https://www.accessowl.io/).",
