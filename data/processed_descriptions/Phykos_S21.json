Founded in 2020 and based in San Francisco, Phykos aims to harness the natural power of seaweed as a sustainable solution for carbon capture and climate mitigation. The company is part of the Y Combinator S21 batch, which speaks to its potential and the backing of a prestigious accelerator.\n\nDespite having a small team of two, Phykos is tackling a daunting challenge\u2014addressing climate change through innovative agricultural practices. The company's emphasis on seaweed highlights the growing recognition of marine solutions in the larger conversation about climate action.\n\nWith Gustaf Alstromer as their Group Partner, Phykos is well-positioned to leverage mentorship and resources from Y Combinator to help propel their mission forward. They\u2019re tagged under important themes like carbon capture and removal, climate action, and the San Francisco Bay Area tech ecosystem\u2014indicating their serious intent to make a real difference.\n\nWhile specific initiatives are currently unspecified, Phykos represents a promising intersection of environmental science and technology with a clear goal: to make our planet healthier through the power of the ocean.
