With a compact team of four, Pulse is on a mission to revolutionize unstructured document extraction, making complex data accessible and usable for businesses.\n\n**Core Offering:**\nPulse provides a powerful API that converts various document formats\u2014like PDFs, Word files, and Excel spreadsheets\u2014into data that large language models (LLMs) can readily process. The beauty of Pulse lies in its simplicity: it integrates seamlessly with existing systems in just five minutes, without the need for extensive training or complicated setups. This means businesses can start extracting meaningful insights from their documents almost immediately.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n1. **Versatile Document Processing**: Pulse excels at accurately parsing documents, regardless of layout or format. Whether it\u2019s charts, tables, or plain text, Pulse handles it like a pro.\n\n2. **Industry-Agnostic Solution**: The technology is designed to be broadly applicable across a range of industries, including finance, healthcare, legal, insurance, real estate, and supply chain. Its zero-shot model means it doesn\u2019t require custom training on proprietary data.\n\n3. **Fast Integration and Top-notch Security**: Businesses can integrate Pulse within five minutes. It comes with enterprise-level security, being SOC 2 Type 2 and HIPAA compliant. Plus, it operates on a strict zero-data retention policy, ensuring that user data is not utilized for training their models.\n\n4. **Custom Processing Pipelines**: Users can create tailored retrieval workflows (RAG pipelines) to automate document ingestion, structured extraction, and database integration effortlessly.\n\n**Current Status and Future**:\nRecently, Pulse announced a seed funding round of $3.9 million, which is likely to fuel its growth and bolster its development efforts. The company positions itself as a leading player in the generative AI space focused on B2B solutions.\n\n**Further Information**:\nFor a deeper dive into Pulse\u2019s offerings, pricing, or to book a demo, visit their website at [runpulse.com](https://www.runpulse.com/).\n\nIn summary, Pulse is an ambitious venture that is transforming the way businesses handle and extract insights from their unstructured data, making it not just faster and easier but also more secure and compliant.
