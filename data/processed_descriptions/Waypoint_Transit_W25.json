    "description": "Waypoint Transit is an AI transportation planning consultant that generates technical studies and reports for municipal agencies. With Waypoint, cities can generate higher-quality reports faster, and at lower cost, reducing timelines from years to months.\r\n\nVarun and Ryan met at Stanford, where they graduated with degrees in CS and EE respectively. Before founding Waypoint, Varun worked on AI at Microsoft and Ryan worked on chip design at Apple.\r\n\nUS cities are facing three major crises: congestion, budget deficits, and climate change. At the same time, city governments are understaffed and frequently need to contract work out to expensive consultants. Leveraging recent advancements in AI, we empower cities to reduce their costs, build infrastructure, and respond to problems quickly.\r\n\nIn the United States, state and local governments spend $170B on transportation capital projects, with an estimated 10-15% of that cost going to planning and consultants. This represents an ~$20B market opportunity in the US alone. Through automation, we can redefine the existing transportation and urban planning consulting markets.\r\n\nFor more information, visit waypointtransit.com or contact us at contact@waypointtransit.com.",
