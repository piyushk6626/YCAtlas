    "generated_description": "### Remora: Capturing Carbon from Semi-Trucks\n\n**Overview:**\nFounded in 2020 and based in Detroit, MI, Remora is tackling carbon emissions from semi-trucks head-on. Imagine a device that not only captures CO2 directly from a truck's tailpipe but also turns this environmental effort into a profit opportunity for truck operators.\n\n**Mission:**\nRemora\u2019s goal is straightforward\u2014reduce emissions from heavy-duty trucks while generating revenue. They achieve this through a patented device that filters carbon from exhaust gases, giving trucking companies a new income stream by selling the captured CO2 or using it to earn carbon credits.\n\n**How It Works:**\n1. **Installation:** The device is designed to easily bolt onto Class 8 trucks without making permanent modifications.\n2. **Capture:** It acts like a giant filter, scrubbing the exhaust gases and compressing the CO2 for storage.\n3. **Offloading:** During refueling, truck drivers can offload the captured CO2 quickly, minimizing downtime, while Remora manages the transport of this CO2 to end-users or for permanent underground storage.\n\n**Business Model:**\nBy sharing a portion of the revenue generated from the captured carbon with their clients, Remora allows trucking companies to not only comply with environmental regulations but also to financially benefit from reducing their carbon footprint.\n\n**Team and Backing:**\nWith a growing team of 45, Remora is supported by notable investors including Y Combinator, Lowercarbon Capital, and Union Square Ventures. One of their group partners is Gustaf Alstromer, a key player in the startup ecosystem.\n\n**Current Focus:**\nRemora is actively engaged in product development and partnerships. With installations at logistics hubs and future plans for offloading stations at truck stops, they are poised to be a significant player in the climate tech space.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRemora is more than just a company; it's part of a movement towards sustainable freight transport. They blend innovation with real-world practicality, making it easier for trucking companies to contribute to a greener planet\u2014all while earning extra income.
