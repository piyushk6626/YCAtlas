Students can upload their study materials and receive immediate, tailored support that covers three main pillars:\n\n1. **Better Understanding**: The platform provides clear overviews and explanations for key topics, supplemented by an AI chat that understands the student’s specific context.\n  \n2. **Effective Practicing**: Alice creates custom exercises based on the student's needs—think flashcards, multiple-choice questions, and full exam simulations crafted to suit individual learning styles and curricular requirements.\n\n3. **Targeted Improvement**: The platform identifies areas where the student struggles, helping them focus their efforts more efficiently and effectively.\n\nBut it’s more than just a study tool; Alice allows students to engage socially by studying with friends and competing in challenges, making learning not just productive but also enjoyable.\n\n### Traction and Growth\n\nAlice.tech has already attracted over 2,000 students, an impressive feat for a new company, and it boasts a monthly revenue growth rate (MRR) of 30% in its B2C segment, with emerging interest in B2B. \n\n### Team and Leadership\n\nWith a lean team of six, the company benefits from the mentorship of Tom Blomfield as their Group Partner, which lends a competitive edge to their strategy and growth.\n\n### Why Alice.tech Stands Out\n\nThe ability to support multiple languages (currently ten) sets Alice apart, catering to a diverse student population. The platform also prides itself on fostering a more engaging study experience that doesn’t just promise better grades but delivers active, interactive learning.\n\nIn terms of accessibility, Alice offers various pricing plans, including a free \"Hustler Plan\" that provides basic functionality alongside more comprehensive paid tiers.\n\n### User Experience and Reviews\n\nStudent testimonials are positive, highlighting the efficiency of the tool in simplifying study processes and enhancing exam readiness. From generating practice questions post-lecture to providing instant feedback on performance, users find Alice.tech to be an invaluable study companion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlice.tech is not just another education tool; it’s a responsive, intelligent platform designed to redefine the way students prepare for exams. With its growing user base and expanding features, it's a prime example of how AI can improve personal learning experiences. If you're a student looking to streamline your study process and boost your exam confidence, Alice might just be the AI study buddy you've been waiting for.\n\nFor more information, check out their website at [alice.tech](https://www.alice.tech/).",

With a nimble team of three, the company's mission is to transform how knowledge is infused into language models, achieving this with an elegant approach that requires just 10 samples. \n\nWhat sets Automorphic apart? They’ve developed a technique that goes beyond the conventional context window limitations of large language models (LLMs). Their flagship product, **Conduit**, allows developers to fine-tune models seamlessly, providing the ability to train specific adapters for different behaviors or knowledge. This not only enhances model capabilities but does so efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\nAutomorphic’s approach to knowledge infusion addresses the inefficiencies of traditional methods, like prompt stuffing—techniques that can only take you so far. Instead, Conduit empowers teams to rapidly iterate on their models with human-in-the-loop feedback, drastically cutting down on the time to deploy improvements. The models learn and adapt over time, continuously enhancing performance based on real user inputs.\n\nMoreover, Conduit offers compatibility with the OpenAI API, allowing users to integrate the technology without having to overhaul their existing setups. For those concerned with data privacy, Automorphic also supports on-premises deployments, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure within clients' private cloud environments.\n\nIn a landscape where the demand for intelligent and adaptable language models is ever-increasing, Automorphic is positioned as a frontrunner—simplifying the way knowledge is integrated into AI and promising to empower developers in creating robust, self-improving models that evolve with their needs.\n\nTo keep up with Automorphic's developments or to join their private beta, check out their website at [automorphic.ai](https://automorphic.ai/) and dive into this exciting new frontier.",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.",

Founded in 2023 and currently part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Storia AI is on a mission to transform how developers interact with code. Their vision is straightforward yet ambitious: to build an open-source AI copilot that comprehensively understands a company's code and its broader context. \n\nAs the industry moves towards automating code generation, software engineers increasingly find themselves in roles that require deep comprehension of existing code rather than just writing new lines. Storia AI tackles this shift head-on with a tool named Sage. Think of Sage as a smart assistant for developers—an AI that not only generates suggestions but truly understands the nuances of a specific codebase.\n\n### What Can Sage Do?\n\nSage acts as a powerful resource for developers, capable of answering complex questions that go beyond simple coding tasks. Here’s what it offers:\n\n1. **Contextual Recommendations**: Developers can consult Sage on technical choices, like determining the right vector database that meets project constraints.\n2. **Comparative Analysis**: It can clarify why one database option might be more suitable than another—say, Redis versus Milvus.\n3. **Integration Queries**: Sage assesses codebases for compatibility with other libraries and provides actionable steps for integration.\n\nWhat sets Sage apart is its reliance on verified sources. Instead of generating potentially misleading information (a common issue known as \"hallucination\"), Sage provides answers anchored in a wealth of documentation from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and internal technical documents. This places reliable, contextualized knowledge directly in the hands of developers.\n\n### A Strong Foundation\n\nStoria AI was founded by a small but formidable team with deep roots in both AI and software engineering. Julia has extensive experience with contextual neural networks, having worked on foundational technologies at Google, while Mihail was instrumental in developing early LLMs (Large Language Models) at Amazon Alexa. Their 20+ years of combined experience positions them uniquely to tackle the challenges of building an AI that comprehends complex codebases.\n\n### Where They’re Headed\n\nCurrently located in Millbrae, CA, Storia AI operates with a compact team of two talented individuals, backed by David Lieb as their Group Partner. The tagging of their work in areas like ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘developer tools’, and ‘machine learning’ indicates a focused strategy that resonates deeply within the tech community. As they progress, there are ambitious goals to deepen Sage’s understanding of not just private codebases but potentially every line of code available online.\n\nIn a nutshell, Storia AI is not just another tech startup; it's a thoughtful response to the inevitable evolution of software development. By building a bridge between AI and developers, they’re paving the way for more efficient, informed, and high-quality code architecture. If you’re interested in learning more or seeking support for your own codebase, check out their website at [storia.ai](https://storia.ai). \n\nStoria AI is a company to watch, not just for what they are building today but for how they will shape the future of coding.",
